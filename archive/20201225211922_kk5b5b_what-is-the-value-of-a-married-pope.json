I said it as a joke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Fancy obeyed.  Which is probably the same as saying, the intent of it got activated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So last night, as I was noticing that the energy body is easy to see, if you only look down, there it was! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, what&amp;#39;s the problem?  It&amp;#39;s easy to see!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And hey, it looks exactly like the one Cholita showed me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I was trying to count tentacles, I noticed a meager video playing above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a tiny little TV, floating in arms reach, to the right and a few feet up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was Fancy again.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled the TV over.   Put it in front of my face, because the monitor was only 3 inches wide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy was in some climax scene with someone else, but it had ended.  I missed it! I only saw her facing someone as if they&amp;#39;d finished talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to &amp;quot;rewind it&amp;quot; by swiping my hand in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It did in fact rewind, until Fancy was turning to the left to enter a room, with only her back showing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I couldn&amp;#39;t find the &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos could no more cancel his own intent, than I could cancel Fancy&amp;#39;s romance movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_kk5b5b", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/kk5b5b/what_is_the_value_of_a_married_pope/gh75cxp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1609088357.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1609088357.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gh72fk7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1609086708.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gh6z1qh", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Someone dug up a passing reference from one of the workshops or private classes in the '90s saying that the title of Tasha's second book was going to be Stalking the Double (or Stalking with the Double).\n\nIt was always listed on Amazon and other book selling sites as \"Untitled Sequel to The Sorcerer's Crossing.\"\n\nBesides being the title of one of the chapters in the manuscript, the whole text basically builds to that as a promise of what she's going to learn from Zuleica when she finally reaches her house at the end of the book.\n\nAnd it's something that wasn't covered very well in Carlos's, Florinda's, or Taisha's previous work.

I'm told someone said they asked Reni and Carols, who said Taisha did not write it.\n\nBut then, they've given up on teaching sorcery, in favor of a different way to make money.\n\nFirst, the people arguing about this are clueless about sorcery. It's another mini \"book deal\" in their mind, to argue about inventory and show how \u201cpure\u201d they are. So you won\u2019t see honest discussion on a chat location. History shows, people even make up stuff. We saw that recently with some eager chat guys, passing on bad information. One even claimed \u201cTaisha was coming back\u201d, in response to the book.\n\nSo chat is cheap.\n\nThe people who can do darkroom gazing, proving they can move their assemblage points, see genius material in that book. Stuff they didn't think of or yet discover, which is obviously true.\n\nStuff you just can't make up, unless you can get silent and move the assemblage point.\n\nSo whoever wrote that book, bravo! At least, from the quotes I\u2019ve seen. Has anyone seen bad passages, obviously sort of questionable?\n\nBut let's look at the evidence. I'm afraid, we can't trust people on a chat saying that Reni claims it's false, and I'm not sure we can even know what Reni would say, even if it were written by Taisha. \n\n1) Cholita was given a copy of Taisha's book. I looked at it, and it was typed and photocopied just like that one. I remember thinking how can they have so much money, and get such a poor copy to hand out? The number of pages was in line with that book. \n\n2) We've been looking around to try to figure out why Taisha's next book, listed on Amazon, was never available for sale. So it was known there was a book they intended to publish. But decided not to. Why? Maybe someone remembers the title of that one? At any rate, it could explain why things are so mixed up. It\u2019s been mixed up, as far as the real book Taisha wrote, all along. As if something were stopping it from being printed. \n\n3) Someone asked Cleargreen why they didn't print it, and was told it was a copyright issue. If it's a fake, as someone in chat claims to have heard, how come another person heard it had a copyright problem (such as Taisha isn't around to agree to publish it?).\n\n4). I've been slowly bringing my double out in the darkroom. Visibly! And I can walk through the walls into other worlds, or reach behind the wall. Those are not something you can do, without switching bodies.\n\nNote: If you think hard about incidents in the book when someone was defying the laws of physics, it could always shave been someone in their dreaming double. For instance, was Carlos really with Genaro most of the time, or was it usually his double?\n\nMyself,  I've seen a 3rd arm two times in the darkroom. I concluded, the dreaming double doesn't materialize the way you\u2019d guess from the books. It's not separate at all, and can simply show up where you are. But to perceive it, you have to be far on the J curve. Taisha's book verifies all of this, when she\u2019s taught to make it come out on the ground, while she is in the tree house. None of the other books make it so clear. She even explains how to lure it out, while you are in one place, getting it to be in another nearby, where you can see it. Where is that in the other books?\n\n5) I was in UC system Shotokan Karate. So was Taisha, because she was associated with UCLA. I knew her teacher who hated women (Nishiyama) because I was there 5 years, at the same time as Taisha. I probably saw that famous picture being taken, because that year they had a multi-school tournament at UCR and there were 2 women being photographed. Back then, women were so rare they always got photographed (plus they look better in a GI).  I heard someone complain that the women could not fight, and only participated in Kata.\n\nI went to the Budokan in 74 or 75. Taisha talks about going to the Budokan in that book.  As I recall, it was every 4 years.  So unless Taisha went in 70 or 78, we went the same year. Likely I was on the same plane with her. How could someone who made up that book, know about the tournament and the Budokan?\n\nWish I could remember her hitting the gong, but tournaments are never watched fully. You only watch your home school, and the final blackbelt battles. Taisha was UCLA school, I was UCR.\n\n6) Taisha gave lectures on alternate ways to learn in private classes, and also taught some to the women. The match trick was one of them. I remember thinking it was horrible, why is she mixing outside stuff? But in fact, she did. Any other techniques in there, which stand out? I can see if she told us about them back in the 90s.\n\n7) Cholita has a dark spirit which hangs out around her garden. I saw it before I ever heard of such a thing. And there it is, in Taisha\u2019s book. Wasn\u2019t mentioned in the others.\n\nToo bad we don\u2019t have any more private class members. They could get hold of the original book.\n\n8) Cholita has a phantom copy of our home. I\u2019ve been in there many times. This is verified by stories told by the witches and Carlos, regarding Pandora. But more details we did not receive.\n\nIn Cholita\u2019s case, she keeps adding room. I felt bad even writing about that, but a good rule of thumb with sorcery, is just report what happened. Don\u2019t try to justify it. But also, don\u2019t exaggerate. Then you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nThis book says that yes, in fact that happens. Rooms get added on. How could someone have invented that? It\u2019s sheer nonsense.\n\n9) I\u2019ve heard (but not seen any text) that Taisha says sorcerers meet up in some shared phantom zone. I\u2019ve been visiting one a lot, ever since private classes. I suppose that\u2019s the sort of thing angry Castaneda fans make up, but I never heard any do that. And yet, there it is in Taisha\u2019s book.\n\n10). Her daytime gazing technique is brilliant! You have to have struggled a long time learning to get silent, to recognize the genius of it. You externalize your internal dialogue by focusing on specific details. Carlos had you blur our eyes and gaze at all details (right way of walking). But that approach doesn\u2019t move the assemblage point very well. Silence doesn\u2019t move it. You have to look at something from the second attention, to get it to move. This daytime gazing technique is closer to darkroom gazing at colors. Since the book has Zuleica (Emilito?) teaching it, it makes sense.\n\n11). I made that \u201cDon Juan\u2019s world\u201d map. One thing that disturbed me was, there was one extra person in his line. The books said 15 (or something like that), but there was one extra. It seemed like a flaw. But in Taisha\u2019s book we find out, Emilito was really Zuleica. Which fixes the counting problem.\n\nWe also had another person mention they heard Taisha say that at a workshop. Or read it in some notes.\n\nI suspect there are more points in favor of it being genuine. In fact, while writing those, I kept forgetting more.   One just escaped me a second ago. It was what Taisha had told me once, and which is also in that book.\n\nI must admit, the witches and Carols were always \"trouble makers\" in my thinking. Carlos had such a tidy world, and they'd come along and contradict how I understood it.\n\nBut they always turned out to be right.\n\nSo if the book ruffles some feathers, you're only going through what private class members did also. History is sort of repeating.\n\nI\u2019m more troubled by not being able to trust what we hear Reni has said, than about this book.

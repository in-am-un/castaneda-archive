Also what I say is my interpretation of why it lasted so long.\n\nThis dream happened to have occurred when The Inception previews were everywhere, unrelated but I was really excited for the movie. \n\nThe dream started very benign and ordinary. I wasn\u2019t lucid at first. I had another very ordinary life and a different identity. A family, a job, and when I looked in the mirror I looked like a different person. That\u2019s all I remember. Then after many days or weeks or years of work and same old same old something happened that made me question my reality. I started having memories of a different life, my life. I remembered friends faces and names that I have IRL. They became so strong that I considered suicide. One day I broke and killed myself, I can\u2019t remember how. I do remember I was really hesitant. Thinking about what my dream friends and family would think if I did. Maybe I was entering some kind of psychosis and making my other life up. But either way I did kill myself.\n\nI then entered another dream. More similar to my real life but only in minimal ways. There were people I remembered, my real friends and family. But it wasn\u2019t my real life. It didn\u2019t take me as long to feel pretty sure that I wasn\u2019t awake or dead or what but it still felt like weeks at the least. I killed my self again. \n\nRinse and repeat I probably killed myself in varying ways dozens if not hundreds of times. It felt like an eternity of questioning my existence. Keep in mind I was lucid in a way but starting to wonder if I was actually sleeping. I had a sneaking suspicion that I died in my sleep and was in some kind of purgatory. I had never had dreams within dreams. There were multiple occurrences of going to sleep for the night in a dream and then dreaming within that dream, and having the same feeling that I was in a dream and killing myself only to wake back up in the previous dream. It wasn\u2019t always linear. There were many times I would enter dreams only to kill myself 3 times and wake back up in the 3rd to last dream I had. I was in a never ending loop of sorts, questioning every ounce of what life and existence meant, and not knowing if I\u2019d ever make it back to that mysterious life I thought I was originally living.\n\nAs time and lives and dreams went on I started remembering \u201cyes! I fell asleep on my friends couch! I remember!\u201d. The specifics of my original life kept getting clearer and clearer. The only goal I had was to get back to there. I missed my friends and family. I started losing the love and appreciation for my dream friends. I started just killing myself over and over. I obviously didn\u2019t keep count, or considered each new dream to have any importance other than a stepping stone back to reality. I remember waking up on a shore in one (opening scene of Inception), on top of a skyscraper over looking a giant city. Each dream became less believable that it could possibly be the start of a new life. They became so extravagant that it became easy to think \u201coh this is a dream\u201d. \n\nI still wasn\u2019t entirely sure I was dreaming or died in my sleep until I started to be able to feel my body on the couch physically. Very little at first, like a tingling in a way; but eventually I started to feel the weight of my own body in the cushions. I was home free and very soon after my next suicide, I opened my eyes.\n\nI almost cried, and had a really confusing mix of emotions. It just so happened that right when I woke up my friend left her bedroom and I tried to spill out as much as I could remember. I wanted to hug her but at the same time I knew there was no way she could comprehend the lifetimes of things I just went through by me just telling her, let alone understand that a hug was warranted for this occasion. \n\nTo this day I can LD. My guess is that I was in a deep deep REM sleep. And today I usually LD when I have already woken up and gone back to a light sleep. I really hope I never become lucid in that deep of a sleep again. It was pretty cool to see The Inception kinda close to this happening. Especially seeing the opening scene of him on a beach. Before the movie came out I was an active songwriter. A couple days after the dream I wrote a song about it. Not trying to promote it at all I don\u2019t even show my old music to my friends.

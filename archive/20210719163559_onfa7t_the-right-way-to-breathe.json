Outside of the darkroom?\n\nA user in public chat brought up that they remembered that towards the start of his apprenticeship don Juan told Carlos that one of the reasons he was so nervous &amp; unhealthy was the way he breathed...short, shallow/constricted, and from the chest. There are hundreds of references to \"breath\" in the books, proving that it definitely wasn't something that was skipped over instruction-wise, but the best description of \"the right way of breathing\" appears to be in Chapter 7 of The Sorcerer's Crossing:\n\n\"We were watching the shadows that the trees cast on the ground, when suddenly a gust of wind made the leaves quiver.\n\nThe leaves began to shimmer in a flurry of light and dark, causing ripples in the patterns on the ground.\n\nWhen the wind passed, the leaves once again became still and so did the shadows.\n\n\"The mind is like these shadows,\" Clara said softly. \"When our breathing is even, our minds are still. If our breathing is erratic, the mind quivers like stirred leaves.\"\n\nI tried to notice if my breathing was even or disturbed, but I honestly couldn't tell.\n\n\"If your breath is agitated, your mind becomes restless,\" Clara continued:\n\n\"To quiet the mind, it's best to begin by quieting your breathing.\"\n\nShe told me to keep my back erect and to concentrate on my breathing until it was soft and rhythmic, like that of an infant.\n\nI pointed out that if a person is physically active as we had just been, hiking over hills, one's breathing couldn't possibly be as soft as an infant's who just lies around and does nothing.\n\n\"Besides,\" I said, \"I don't know how infants breathe. I haven't been around many of them, and when I was, I didn't pay attention to their breathing.\"\n\nClara moved closer and put one hand on my back and the other on my chest.\n\nTo my dismay, she pressed until I was so constricted that I felt I was going to suffocate. I tried to move away but she held me down with an iron grip.\n\nTo compensate, my stomach began moving in and out rhythmically as air again entered my body.\n\n\"This is how infants breathe,\" she said. \"Remember the sensation of your stomach popping out so you can reproduce it regardless of whether you are walking, exercising or lying around doing nothing.\n\n\"**You probably won't believe this, but we are so civilized that we have to relearn how to breathe properly.**\"\n\nShe removed her hands from my chest and back. \"Now let the breath rise to fill your chest cavity,\" she instructed. \"But don't let it flood your head.\"\n\n\"There is no way for the air to get into my head,\" I laughed.\n\n\"Don't take me so literally,\" she scolded. \"When I say air, I'm really talking about energy derived from the breath, which enters the abdomen, the chest and then the head.\"\n\nI had to laugh at her seriousness. I braced myself for another barrage of Chinese metaphors.\n\nShe smiled and winked. \"My seriousness is a corollary of my size,\" she said with a chuckle. \"We big people are always more serious than petite jovial ones. Isn't that right, Taisha?\"\n\nI didn't know why she was including me when she talked of big people. I was at least two inches shorter than her and a good thirty-five pounds lighter.\n\nI thoroughly resented being called big, and even more so her intimation that I was overly serious, but I didn't voice this because I knew she would make an issue out of it, and tell me to do a deep recapitulation on the subject of my size.\n\nClara looked at me as if to gauge my reaction to her statement.\n\nI smiled and pretended it hadn't fazed me in the least.\n\nUpon seeing my attentiveness, she became serious again and continued to explain that our emotional well-being is directly linked to the rhythmic flow of our breathing.\n\n\"The breathing of a person who is upset,\" she said, leaning closer, \"is rapid and shallow and is localized in the chest or head.\n\n\"The breathing of a relaxed person sinks to the abdomen.\"\n\nI tried to lower my breathing to my stomach so that Clara wouldn't suspect that I had been upset.\n\nShe smiled knowingly and added, \"It's harder for big people to breath from the abdomen because their center of gravity is just a bit higher. It's therefore even more important that we remain calm and unperturbed.\"\n\nShe went on to explain that the body is divided into three main chambers of energy: the abdomen, chest and head. She touched my stomach just below my navel, then my solar plexus and then the center of my forehead.\n\nShe explained that these three points are the key centers of the three chambers. The more relaxed the mind and body are, the more air a person can take into each of the three body divisions.\n\n\"Infants take in a vast amount of air for their size,\" Clara said. \"However, as we grow older we become constricted, especially around the lungs, and we take in less air.\"\n\nClara took a deep breath before continuing. \"Since emotions are directly linked to the breath,\" she said, \"a good way to calm ourselves is by regulating our breathing.\n\n\"For example, we can train ourselves to absorb more energy by deliberately elongating each breath we take.\"\n\nShe stood up and asked me to observe her shadow carefully.\n\nI noticed that it was perfectly still.\n\nThen she told me to stand and look at my own shadow.\n\nI couldn't help detecting a slight quiver, like the shadow of the trees when the leaves were touched by a breeze.\n\n\"Why is my shadow shaking?\" I asked. \"I thought I was standing perfectly still.\"\n\n\"Your shadow quivers because the winds of emotion are blowing through you,\" Clara replied. \"You're more quiet than when you first began to recapitulate, but. there is still a great deal of agitation left inside you.\"\n\nShe told me to stand on my left leg with my right leg raised and bent at the knee.\n\nI wobbled as I tried to keep my balance.\n\nI marveled that she stood on one leg as easily as she had stood on two, and her shadow was absolutely motionless.\n\n\"You seem to have a hard time keeping your balance,\" Clara noted, setting down her leg and raising the other one:\n\n\"That means that your thoughts and feelings are not at ease, and neither is your breathing.\"\n\nI raised my other leg to try the exercise again.\n\nThis time my balance was better, but when I saw how still Clara's shadow was, I experienced a sudden pang of envy and I had to lower my leg to keep from falling.\n\n\"Whenever we have a thought,\" Clara explained, setting down her leg again, \"our energy moves in the direction of that thought.\n\n\"Thoughts are like scouts; they cause the body to move along a certain path.\"\"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Right Way to Breathe", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Misc.

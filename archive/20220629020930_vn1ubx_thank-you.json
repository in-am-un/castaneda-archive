But since you consider recap to be keeping you from getting started, I will.\n\nZuleica, likely the oldest companion of don Juan,  told us it makes no difference if you do recap or not, once you can move the assemblage point into the deep orange zone on the J curve.  They didn't have the J curve colors, so I translated what she said.\n\nAnd I've discovered that once it's in the purple zone, you can do \"on the spot\" recapitulation of actual memories you can visibly see, floating in the air.\n\nThey \"taint\" the topic of Silent Knowledge, so that if you are doing what might be considered \"extreme\" magic, those left over memories hold you back and up pops a \"visual\".\n\nLike an alert on a computer saying something like, \"Warning!!! Blockage found.  Attempting to identify.  Identified!  Shall I delete it?\"\n\nNo kidding here!  However, if you actually heard that I'd suspect a weird creature like Minx was behind it. I guarantee  you he can do robot imitations if he feels like it.\n\nHe's Cholita's ally.  A gift from Carlos.\n\nMinx was taunting me last night.  Did his \"crazy squirrel\" imitation for me.\n\nIt made me realize, Minx doesn't turn into a squirrel to be \"fun\".\n\nHe turns into a crazy squirrel, doing things to worry you.  He likes to worry people with his impossible squirrel behavior.  Like coming into a strange house to beg for food like a small dog on his hind legs, holding out his little paws.\n\nOr doing circus acrobat routines way above you on a telephone wire which traverses your street,  seemingly with no desire to cross to the other telephone pole.\n\nThen later Minx decided to take a nap in the air, like it was a bed.  I was working on my phantom realm and wanted to see if the \"lost and found\" closet had materialized yet, and there he was. Floating at chest level, 20 feet from me.\n\nNapping right where I needed the closet to be.\n\nHe actually caused me to worry for an instant that I don't want a crazy squirrel going through my things!  I almost ran over there to stop him, before I realized how absurd that was.\n\nThere's some debate on whether Minx is a hoarder. Of energy body pieces he can get a hold of.  That would include anything in that phantom lost and found.\n\nAt one point when I was considering why women are so talented, and men have to work so hard,  and what I'd *seen* last time about that,  Minx commented \"If you really want to know, you'll just have to turn into a woman!\"\n\nHe laughed visibly to himself, with no sound.\n\nHe has a point there.  We can do that.\n\nAnd Minx undoubtedly knew the death defier,  who escaped the IOB realms by changing sex, so perhaps it was a \"private IOB joke\".  About \"how well\" that works out for sorcerers.\n\nSo it seems that Zuleica was not only right it makes no difference if you did recapitulation,  once you get there deeply into the second attention,  but that she didn't actually mean you can skip it.\n\nShe just meant that in SK mode, you get TURBO RECAP.  It's like a 10MHz processor, compared to a crummy 4.7MHz when you aren't in SK mode.\n\nWell, maybe more like 3GHz, but I always did find those turbo computers amusing.\n\nBack then we thought the Japanese were going to take over the future, and their 100MHz processor claims had everyone worried for a few years.\n\nI sort of doubted the idea of coming in today and telling people that recap completely changes for a sorcerer, but then I realized, you have to move your assemblage point all the way to the end of the J curve.\n\nIf you can do that without a full recap, then you're good!  And better off doing that, then wasting time sitting in a chair with your eyes closed.\n\nIf you can't move it there, then you need to do it the old fashioned way.  Get more energy back using traditional recap.\n\nMost apprentices probably end up doing both, but the witches these days just \"recap on the fly\" when they notice something, or have a current interaction they want to erase.\n\nI think we misunderstood what that means to them, but the books and Carlos very not talkative about Silent Knowledge until the end, when Carlos needed to speed us up.\n\nIt seems like a \"new topic\", when in fact that's merely what \"*seeing*\" is.  Silent Knowledge.\n\nSo when the witches do \"recap on the fly\", I don't think that means they do it when the Starbucks guy gives them the wrong coffee.\n\nThey do it in response to \"pop up SK\".\n\nTaisha explained in one lecture,  you can be driving down the street, learning what it means to be at that position of the assemblage point.\n\nThat's continuous SK mode!   Otherwise the only think you're learning driving down the streets of LA, is what's on sale at the various businesses you pass by, and who wants an Oscar this year and needs to remind the Oscar voters.  Who live around there.\n\nAs for erasing personal history, always consider some important things when reading the books.\n\nBecause not everything in there applies to you.\n\nIf you look for them, you'll figure them out.\n\nOne was that don Juan often used the Nagual's blow on Carlos, so that whatever he was taught in that part of the story, is only useful to people who can move into the orange zone.\n\nNo beginner can do that.\n\nThe instructions for Carlos to erase personal history were closer to don Juan not wanting to lose his gains, which came from teaching Carlos in secret.\n\nStuff Carlos couldn't remember.\n\nSo he was told to erase personal history, much the same way a huge company will take out an insurance policy on key employees.  Because they're too important to the company's plans, and if they die they'll be very expensive to replace.\n\nYou aren't.\n\nSo just do darkroom!!!\n\nSee magic first, worry what to do with it later.", "edited": 1656514036.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ie6t4ww", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I &lt;strong&gt;saw&lt;/strong&gt; something last night I hadn&amp;#39;t planned to share.

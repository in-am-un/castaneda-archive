I just selected her for the dress with blue stripes, and she was standing up facing the right direction.  Otherwise, it's not like the one I saw.\n\nHowever, I did get a very clear look at her many times.   Eyes open fully awake.\n\nExcept anything I saw was wiped from my memory in seconds.  Even if I saw it many times, it faded into nothing over the  hours following it. I had to draw this from what I typed into chat and this post.   The next day.\n\nWhich is part of the problem with trying to teach people sorcery through dark room gazing.\n\nIt's \"dreaming awake\".\n\nThe entire Castaneda community decided to ignore that from the books, and focus on what they could pretend and make up, from ordinary dreams.\n\nSo when reading an account, they're likely to think it was just another exaggerated dream, as if being fully awake with eyes open doesn't matter.\n\nBecause if it does, than they're a fraud and have been misleading people for years with tales of lame dreams.\n\nCarlos NEVER put up with that in private classes.  He once even asked us to tell him our dreams, probably only to interrupt them and explain that's just the liver.\n\nMeaning an ordinary dream, caused by the planet of the liver pouch's influence on the dreaming double.\n\nHe was \"looking\" for something to make that dream obviously \"real\".  Which is automatic if the dream is entered through silence.\n\nBut if not present if it's just a crappy dream.  He wanted us to stop that sort of obsession.\n\nTrust me when I say, if someone had related some dreaming awake, he would have been VERY excited.\n\nHe was hoping for something like that.  But we were too lazy to achieve that.\n\nAlso it's good to remember that the double never sleeps.  He's always \"out there\" doing something, even if you never remember any of it.  On those rare occasions where we fall to sleep and bring some of our Tonal's rationality into the double inside a dream, we get to remember some.  We call that, \"lucidity\", but don't anyone go join the lucid dreaming subreddit.\n\nIts just crap pretending, with an added pretense of being \"scientific\".\n\nLeft there by the evil Monroe perhaps.  A \"scientific prison\" for those interested in dreaming, so they'll never go anywhere.  But be able to seek attention anyway.  And loathe Carlos, as that subreddit does.\n\nPoison for apprentices.\n\nAt any rate, we're always dreaming. It's like a dual life that only meets up so we can remember it, on rare occasions.\n\nBut most important, all this was done awake so don't start keeping  a \"dream journal\".\n\nGeez...  Those are like silence sticks.  The darned stick is absolutely no help at all to get silent.\n\nIt's just cheese sauce on your broccoli.  So you'll eat the damned vege.\n\nAt advanced levels, yes.  A dream journal is useful or you'll forget all the cool stuff you did, and maybe leap back into the river of shit thinking it was all a waste of time.\n\nDive back into the cheese so to speak.\n\nSo last night I was laying on my side, starting to get sore from going to the gym and obsessing over maxing out the weight machines.\n\nI've discovered that weight lifting comes with a DRG penalty.\n\nPain!!!  Even subtle pain, all over, harms the ability to practice dark room gazing.\n\nI was laying on my side sleeping and woke up thinking, \"Get up you lazy bastard and intent will reward you for overcoming this barrier!\"\n\nBut all I could do was open my eyes a bit to see if I'd remembered to turn off and block all the lights and make it perfectly dark.\n\nA woman was standing right there,  her face just inches from mine.\n\nShe'd been waiting.\n\nCholita used to do that to me. But not for a long time.\n\nAs she emailed me yesterday,  \"No Zu Lei,  CA!\"\n\nTranslation:  She wasn't going to be any part of recreating Zuleica's house, in California.\n\nShe'd gotten more work from one of the patrons Carlos gave her long ago. So she was in a \"talkative mood\".\n\nBy email.  And that was the extent of the message.\n\nThis particular woman, waiting for me to get up and practice, seemed to be the woman standing in the way of the tunnel for the last week.\n\nI'm still trying to figure out who or what she is.  It's further complicated by what seems to be \"Minx\", the Ally of Cholita.  He follows here around sometimes, and hides behind her phantom body.  Appearing to be a weird short goblin.\n\nAs I first saw the second of the Allies of Carlos, when he introduced his class to them 24 years ago!  He used to hide behind the other Ally of Carlos, crouching down so I could only see his face and shoulders.\n\nI opened and closed my eyes to see if the woman's torso would vanish when they were closed.\n\nBut now that I  had noticed her, eyes open or closed made no difference.\n\nAlso, she was a stable torso. Not a floating head.\n\nBut she was pinkish. That's more typical of an inorganic being manifestation.   But not as transparent as those are.\n\nI looked very closely at her face, despite my own \"face blindness\", hoping to recognize her.\n\nShe was pinkish, but when I looked for details I noticed she seemed to be wearing a blue outfit with vertical lines or stripes.  Fine ones, but not gaudy like an ice-cream store uniform.\n\nI could see the details of her clothes and they were blue. Not pink.\n\nI got sucked into a dream.\n\nI could feel that I'd traveled fairly far to get into that dream.\n\nThe woman was standing outdoors. I'd say in a \"park\", but I can't clearly describe any park benches or things like that.\n\nMy reaction was \"What the hell?\", and I zipped back out of that dream. Back to laying on my side.  In the dream I was standing up facing her, looking off into outdoor scenery.\n\nRather sparse it was, far out.  Might have had nice green plants behind her, but off in the distance it was more like an old cowboy movie landscape.\n\nWhen I zipped back, the memory faded away in just a few seconds.\n\nAll gone.\n\nI lay back down the rest of the way on the bed.\n\nI seem to have leaned up a bit to look closer at the woman.\n\nThe entire memory was gone in seconds.\n\nI started to go back to sleep, and the woman's face appeared.\n\nI heard shouting in the distance.  A series of commands, coming from very far away.\n\nI zipped into the dream again, standing there.\n\nI could see the background landscape.\n\nIt sure looked like the other side of the tunnel in Bubble Station.\n\nAnd the woman was real.  Didn't behave like an inorganic being at all.\n\nI backed off to go back to my side of the tunnel, sat up in bed, and gazed towards the tunnel entrance.\n\nI have an ultra dim LED light positioned on the wall down by the floor, so that if I'm on the bed where I lay or sitting in the middle of the edge, looking at that barely visible led light causes me to look directly to the other end of the tunnel, according to \"line of sight\".\n\nThe tunnel was now playing dreaming scenes.\n\nIt was like one of those sci fi portals, where if you saw a scene you liked you could leap into it.\n\nI saw an unfinished indoor room, with 2x4 beams.\n\nI thought, \"Bubble Station\" looks like that!\n\nI sat up hoping my phantom station was vivid, surrounding the tunnel, but it was still just mostly darkness.\n\nExcept the blue witch from the tunnel was still lurking around.\n\nI did my tensegrity routine. I do the exact same passes and long forms each night, because it stores \"intent\" eventually and your \"muscle memory\" learns how it feels when the assemblage point moves.\n\nIt's almost like each tensegrity form is a little car you can sit in, to roll down the hill.\n\nThe forms become \"rides\" of the assemblage point.\n\nA lot nicer than just doing it like it was pointless \"chi gung\", and \"good for  you\".\n\nLook...  if your sorcery doesn't blow your socks off, that's NOT \"good for you\".\n\nWhile doing my routine  I noticed I had somehow \"earned\" a lot of dreaming attention that night.\n\nThe movements were STUNNING.  Streaks of brilliant colors flowed.\n\nWhile doing the \"mashing energy for intent\" passes, I finally notice why Carlos had emphasized the initial \"shock\" to the back when you thrust your arms down and get into position with the legs shoulder width apart.\n\nHe greatly emphasized how \"useful\" that shock was.\n\nBack then I dreaded it.\n\nIt was the unpleasant part of those movements.\n\nNow, I realize exactly what he was talking about.\n\nWhen mashing energy becomes visible, with the floor showing glowing yellow fibers and dreamlike surfaces you scoot along with your feet, a shock goes up the back with each foot step.\n\nA tiny ripple of physical movement of the muscles needed to do the pass.\n\nIt's not JUST foot movements.  Your entire body has to be controlled by your muscle memory in order to do those.\n\nIf you \"tune into that\", you can see gently rolling waves of awareness traveling up the back, sort of starting from the feet movements.\n\nYou realize why sorcerers are always extending their shoulder and arching their back at stuff.\n\nIt \"rallies\" more energy from your body, to focus it forward on what you are doing.\n\nI finished my series of passes, all of them stunning.  It usually takes hours to get the tensegrity to look that good, and by then I'm in \"don't care\" mode.\n\nBut I was watching the intense light show with full attention and it was darned cool to get there so fast.\n\nWhen I finished I decided to try \"the Wrestler\" pass.  From the Olmec figurine.\n\nI'd noticed that looked like the old, \"give them the shoulder\" lobster strike sorcery thing, that extends the shoulder and arches the back.\n\nLike the mashing energy had started to do.\n\nI had created the \"6000 mile tunnel\" in the first place using that.\n\nIt worked again,  to make the tunnel wider.\n\nThe witch of the tunnel said, \"Three times each.  Never more, never less.\"\n\nIt was telepathic, but certainly not anything I had planned to be \"thinking\".\n\nMy internal dialogue was gone.\n\nShe added, \"Three isn't a magic number.  But if you want to create a \"container\" to help you form  Dream Bubble Station each night, you need to repeat it exactly so that it builds up \"intent\".\n\nI understood.  Three had been popular with Carlos, but if you were Chinese no one would complain if you insisted on 8 times each, a sign of good luck.\n\nI did 3 of the \"wrestler\" passes, which Carlos had in fact taught the women as a \"not-doing\".\n\nThe tunnel got very bright!  It was wide open and the woman stepped in front of it and said, \"Well, it's a bubble station isn't it?    So next toss 3 bubbles in there!\"\n\nI started to do the Pandora's box movement, compressing intense purple clouds into a ball with my hands, while gazing in them to see if the intent was \"storing\".\n\nThey were sparkling in the middle.\n\nI looked to see if there was a dream in there or just sparkles, and the woman said \"Would you get over that?  Give it up.  It didn't work out.  This isn't show business. Just make a nice ball and throw it in.\"\n\nShe added \"The way you learned before.   You \"cast\" it with the back.  Like the wrestler.  The right hand merely \"pushes it\" through the air into the tunnel, after you release the left hand of Pandora's box and it's sitting on top of the right.\"\n\nThe ball was quite impressive.  At the last instant when I pushed it down the tunnel, I saw a tiny face in the middle.\n\nKeep in mind, those puffs are parts of your energy body.   If you toss one through a 6000 mile tunnel, a tiny piece of your double goes with it.\n\nAnd those are sentient.\n\nI suppose you could use an analogy.  Your energy body is like a  burlap bag of trained circus cats.\n\nIn the bag, they've learned to imitate the clowns and walk around like there was a person in there. They even stand on each other's shoulders, to look like a tiny human.\n\nBut it's a bag of cats.\n\nIf you reach in and pull one out, then close the bag, you can toss that cat where you like.  And it'll go check out where you threw it.\n\nEven if you forgot that you \"put out the cat for the night\", he's still searching for mice.\n\nAfter thinking that what went down the tunnel in that ball might have been 5% of my energy body, the woman said, \"It's too messy.  Scoop the wasted awareness into your V spot.  That's how you can make the bubble station form.    Charge that v spot, because it forms translocation scenes.\"\n\nSo one after the other I used Pandora's box to form a nice dream bubble in my right hand, pushed it down the tunnel, and then scooped the flurry of pinkish dreaming fog stirred by the ball,  into my vspot.\n\nI did that three times.\n\nThe ancient seer luggage left 100,000 year or more ago, high above bubble station on a ledge, became visible.\n\nAnd the station itself was somewhat formed.  Enough to work with.\n\nI glanced to the left side to see if the concession stand next door had decided what it ought to be.\n\nIt hadn't formed yet.  It was just a big black and reddish brown rectangle, implying a \"shop\" would be \"coming soon\".\n\nI looked up at the \"luggage\"  to see if it was indeed stuffed animal skins, tied into a bundle.\n\nThe woman said, \"how are you going to get all the way up there to look inside one?\"\n\nI had no idea.\n\nShe remarked, \"Elias could have done it with his left foot.\"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Witch of Bubble Station", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Practical Magic"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"cnsatkm6cm691": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cnsatkm6cm691.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32bb7f29d660675006d8529d6d621d2287d50710"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cnsatkm6cm691.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=455672cf18586efc6b0c106b2cfc4e865cefe056"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cnsatkm6cm691.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ce1011a891046b4b233a1828a0fde399ca8786e"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cnsatkm6cm691.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cb99d4e1ed5c84b1b6ad8bf4886b644b86c726a"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cnsatkm6cm691.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3a521a628974213bd059962be0173c847a06a28"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cnsatkm6cm691.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aacb675bac4164032b2b3c1e90e0c488c3a32f0b"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cnsatkm6cm691.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae75cbcd77dfaf8a0e196f651d39f0cbb5fc3c2f"}, "id": "cnsatkm6cm691"}}, "name": "t3_vfrtar", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Practical Magic", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/za5lD5edjLQK9jmZcPNsNt1uRP0uUL8okVKT3FhE-Ec.jpg", "edited": 1655662191.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1655632564.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cnsatkm6cm691.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ae75cbcd77dfaf8a0e196f651d39f0cbb5fc3c2f\"&gt;\\&amp;quot;Practical Magic\\&amp;quot; gets more and more complex as you go until it contains a \\&amp;quot;story\\&amp;quot;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t anyone get attached to the witch in the pic.

Didn&amp;#39;t behave like an inorganic being at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I backed off to go back to my side of the tunnel, sat up in bed, and gazed towards the tunnel entrance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have an ultra dim LED light positioned on the wall down by the floor, so that if I&amp;#39;m on the bed where I lay or sitting in the middle of the edge, looking at that barely visible led light causes me to look directly to the other end of the tunnel, according to &amp;quot;line of sight&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tunnel was now playing dreaming scenes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was like one of those sci fi portals, where if you saw a scene you liked you could leap into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw an unfinished indoor room, with 2x4 beams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought, &amp;quot;Bubble Station&amp;quot; looks like that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat up hoping my phantom station was vivid, surrounding the tunnel, but it was still just mostly darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except the blue witch from the tunnel was still lurking around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did my tensegrity routine. I do the exact same passes and long forms each night, because it stores &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; eventually and your &amp;quot;muscle memory&amp;quot; learns how it feels when the assemblage point moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s almost like each tensegrity form is a little car you can sit in, to roll down the hill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The forms become &amp;quot;rides&amp;quot; of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot nicer than just doing it like it was pointless &amp;quot;chi gung&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;good for  you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look...  if your sorcery doesn&amp;#39;t blow your socks off, that&amp;#39;s NOT &amp;quot;good for you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While doing my routine  I noticed I had somehow &amp;quot;earned&amp;quot; a lot of dreaming attention that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movements were STUNNING.  Streaks of brilliant colors flowed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While doing the &amp;quot;mashing energy for intent&amp;quot; passes, I finally notice why Carlos had emphasized the initial &amp;quot;shock&amp;quot; to the back when you thrust your arms down and get into position with the legs shoulder width apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He greatly emphasized how &amp;quot;useful&amp;quot; that shock was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back then I dreaded it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the unpleasant part of those movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I realize exactly what he was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When mashing energy becomes visible, with the floor showing glowing yellow fibers and dreamlike surfaces you scoot along with your feet, a shock goes up the back with each foot step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A tiny ripple of physical movement of the muscles needed to do the pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not JUST foot movements.  Your entire body has to be controlled by your muscle memory in order to do those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you &amp;quot;tune into that&amp;quot;, you can see gently rolling waves of awareness traveling up the back, sort of starting from the feet movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You realize why sorcerers are always extending their shoulder and arching their back at stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It &amp;quot;rallies&amp;quot; more energy from your body, to focus it forward on what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finished my series of passes, all of them stunning.  It usually takes hours to get the tensegrity to look that good, and by then I&amp;#39;m in &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t care&amp;quot; mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was watching the intense light show with full attention and it was darned cool to get there so fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I finished I decided to try &amp;quot;the Wrestler&amp;quot; pass.  From the Olmec figurine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d noticed that looked like the old, &amp;quot;give them the shoulder&amp;quot; lobster strike sorcery thing, that extends the shoulder and arches the back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the mashing energy had started to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had created the &amp;quot;6000 mile tunnel&amp;quot; in the first place using that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It worked again,  to make the tunnel wider.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The witch of the tunnel said, &amp;quot;Three times each.  Never more, never less.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was telepathic, but certainly not anything I had planned to be &amp;quot;thinking&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My internal dialogue was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She added, &amp;quot;Three isn&amp;#39;t a magic number.  But if you want to create a &amp;quot;container&amp;quot; to help you form  Dream Bubble Station each night, you need to repeat it exactly so that it builds up &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understood.  Three had been popular with Carlos, but if you were Chinese no one would complain if you insisted on 8 times each, a sign of good luck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did 3 of the &amp;quot;wrestler&amp;quot; passes, which Carlos had in fact taught the women as a &amp;quot;not-doing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tunnel got very bright!  It was wide open and the woman stepped in front of it and said, &amp;quot;Well, it&amp;#39;s a bubble station isn&amp;#39;t it?    So next toss 3 bubbles in there!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to do the Pandora&amp;#39;s box movement, compressing intense purple clouds into a ball with my hands, while gazing in them to see if the intent was &amp;quot;storing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were sparkling in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked to see if there was a dream in there or just sparkles, and the woman said &amp;quot;Would you get over that?  Give it up.  It didn&amp;#39;t work out.  This isn&amp;#39;t show business. Just make a nice ball and throw it in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She added &amp;quot;The way you learned before.   You &amp;quot;cast&amp;quot; it with the back.  Like the wrestler.  The right hand merely &amp;quot;pushes it&amp;quot; through the air into the tunnel, after you release the left hand of Pandora&amp;#39;s box and it&amp;#39;s sitting on top of the right.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ball was quite impressive.  At the last instant when I pushed it down the tunnel, I saw a tiny face in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, those puffs are parts of your energy body.   If you toss one through a 6000 mile tunnel, a tiny piece of your double goes with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And those are sentient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could use an analogy.  Your energy body is like a  burlap bag of trained circus cats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the bag, they&amp;#39;ve learned to imitate the clowns and walk around like there was a person in there. They even stand on each other&amp;#39;s shoulders, to look like a tiny human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s a bag of cats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you reach in and pull one out, then close the bag, you can toss that cat where you like.  And it&amp;#39;ll go check out where you threw it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you forgot that you &amp;quot;put out the cat for the night&amp;quot;, he&amp;#39;s still searching for mice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After thinking that what went down the tunnel in that ball might have been 5% of my energy body, the woman said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s too messy.  Scoop the wasted awareness into your V spot.  That&amp;#39;s how you can make the bubble station form.    Charge that v spot, because it forms translocation scenes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So one after the other I used Pandora&amp;#39;s box to form a nice dream bubble in my right hand, pushed it down the tunnel, and then scooped the flurry of pinkish dreaming fog stirred by the ball,  into my vspot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did that three times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ancient seer luggage left 100,000 year or more ago, high above bubble station on a ledge, became visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the station itself was somewhat formed.  Enough to work with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced to the left side to see if the concession stand next door had decided what it ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It hadn&amp;#39;t formed yet.  It was just a big black and reddish brown rectangle, implying a &amp;quot;shop&amp;quot; would be &amp;quot;coming soon&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked up at the &amp;quot;luggage&amp;quot;  to see if it was indeed stuffed animal skins, tied into a bundle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The woman said, &amp;quot;how are you going to get all the way up there to look inside one?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She remarked, &amp;quot;Elias could have done it with his left foot.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "b23a3d62-e446-11ec-9ff2-264132f2edf3", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "vfrtar", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 22, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/vfrtar/the_witch_of_bubble_station/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/vfrtar/the_witch_of_bubble_station/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1655632564.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "id77lyw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_id48c3p", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It's a great way to move the assemblage point.

Maybe an alien witch from another planet?\n\nHave seen her 2 times already and she just looks to much like \"kali maa\" the hindu deity. I don't know why.\n\nAlso she love the mineshaft for some reson. I was just casually farming crystals in a long minshaft with my father and then she was in a bedroom conected to the mineshaft. Just sitting omn the bed all blue and demonic. Kindof gave me a smile, I was ok at first then I almost fainted.\n\nThen second time was today, I was having a full on conversation with my grandfather, in a oudor resturant in sedona, az (italian style), and he was teaching me about how me using a blind fold is bad and i am bloking \"logic\". First thought he was stupid. He didn't take me serius and called me \"unsober\". Then his sister was telling me a story. She said that me doing dreaming with a blindfold on was equavalent to what some random russian guys was doing. And she showed how 2 russian guys, was able  to sleep for 7 days, by drinking vodka in their sleep, keeping themselves \"unsober\".\n\nIt was wierd that my grandfather and his siter was telling me this. I looked to the side. There she was. for no reson. All blue skin, butiful and clear skin, and wearing a shaman hat with tiger fangs hanging as earings. I baraly notised her. I rember ignoring her and just looking away back at the sister of my grandad talking.\n\nThe him and his sister contiued going on me being stupid for anganging in sleeping dreaming with a mask an that i had \"fever\" becouse of it.\n\nThey told me i am shivering from being so \"unsober\".\n\nI took a glas on the table to check. And they where right. The moment i held the galss it started shaking so fast like an vibrator. IT wasn't humanluy posible to shake this fast. Not possible at all.\n\nSo i held it tighter and the glass began to spinn. in my hand. I turned back an there was still the blue wonam sitting in the backround, but there also a random butiful lady sitting besides me. i showed her how \"cool\" the spinning was. She looked impressed.\n\nThen i was doing telekinesis jedi style with the glass. Then my grand father interupted my showing of to this random lady and actully used his telekinesis. For some reson his was stronger. He even challenged me to prov that my \"force\" was stronger then his. I COULD NOT BELIVE IT. It was my \"dreaming\" and he had somehow more influence in that world than me, altho he was obvuisly a phantom??? Then i knew it had to be the blue lady. I looked at her sitting at the other table just super indiffernt to what was going on. She had the most \"i dont give a shit\" look i have ever seen.\n\nThen she started singing. She was singing in this loud coutry voice\n\n\"    Love,  isn't the love and i am calling it back\n\nEscape, isn't  the love and i am calling him back       \"\n\nAnd while she was singing my grandad showed why my telekinesis was \"weak\". He summoned a white board and drew this two arows pointing vetically into each other . by the one pointing up it said weakness and the one pointing down it said strenght. Basically how i later interpreted it was that u need \"weakness \" to move energy up and \"strenght\" to move energy down and that one should aim at a balance in order to move it \"just correctly\".\n\nAnd all this time the the witch is still singing the same hounting coutry song. and then the lyrics finally made sence. It was a way to call back the double from a long trip. Almost like an end to a movie.\n\n( i can still remeber the lyricks and the melody since i could literally hear it as i went of the bed and searched up the lyricks to confirm the song didn't exist) and it didn't. Nothing like that exist and i can now find the cords to this song on my piano 5 hours later as i tried out shit ( i am decent at playing the piano).\n\nThe song seems to be a way to call the double but it is how  i curently see this. and i think i red your post like an hour after that experince, and before i was about to read it, i just \"knew\" u where going to somehow be aligned with my experince. It was the \"tired\" mood fo the morning i knew it.", "edited": 1655669762.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iczbazt", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I doubt its a regular witch.

She looked impressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then i was doing telekinesis jedi style with the glass. Then my grand father interupted my showing of to this random lady and actully used his telekinesis. For some reson his was stronger. He even challenged me to prov that my &amp;quot;force&amp;quot; was stronger then his. I COULD NOT BELIVE IT. It was my &amp;quot;dreaming&amp;quot; and he had somehow more influence in that world than me, altho he was obvuisly a phantom??? Then i knew it had to be the blue lady. I looked at her sitting at the other table just super indiffernt to what was going on. She had the most &amp;quot;i dont give a shit&amp;quot; look i have ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she started singing. She was singing in this loud coutry voice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;    Love,  isn&amp;#39;t the love and i am calling it back&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Escape, isn&amp;#39;t  the love and i am calling him back       &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while she was singing my grandad showed why my telekinesis was &amp;quot;weak&amp;quot;. He summoned a white board and drew this two arows pointing vetically into each other . by the one pointing up it said weakness and the one pointing down it said strenght. Basically how i later interpreted it was that u need &amp;quot;weakness &amp;quot; to move energy up and &amp;quot;strenght&amp;quot; to move energy down and that one should aim at a balance in order to move it &amp;quot;just correctly&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all this time the the witch is still singing the same hounting coutry song. and then the lyrics finally made sence. It was a way to call back the double from a long trip. Almost like an end to a movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;( i can still remeber the lyricks and the melody since i could literally hear it as i went of the bed and searched up the lyricks to confirm the song didn&amp;#39;t exist) and it didn&amp;#39;t. Nothing like that exist and i can now find the cords to this song on my piano 5 hours later as i tried out shit ( i am decent at playing the piano).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The song seems to be a way to call the double but it is how  i curently see this. and i think i red your post like an hour after that experince, and before i was about to read it, i just &amp;quot;knew&amp;quot; u where going to somehow be aligned with my experince. It was the &amp;quot;tired&amp;quot; mood fo the morning i knew it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/vfrtar/the_witch_of_bubble_station/iczbazt/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1655669131.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_vfrtar", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_vfrtar", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "icyjxjn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1655656499.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_icyeoop", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Could be...\n\nBut my darkroom is infested with \"beings\".\n\nNot just IOBs.

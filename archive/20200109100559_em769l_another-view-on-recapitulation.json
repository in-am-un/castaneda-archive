All of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the Buddha, if he actually existed and wasn&amp;#39;t made up by the Chinese, was a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sitting with your eyes closed, grinning??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s fake magic designed to suck up attention for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the problem for some beginners, is in that rock song.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We won&amp;#39;t be fooled again!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, they&amp;#39;re only willing to put in a small effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that won&amp;#39;t do it with real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real magic isn&amp;#39;t actually learned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to make what&amp;#39;s clearly a real effort, and then it&amp;#39;s gifted to you, bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From something external.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all of reality works that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_em769l", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/em769l/another_view_on_recapitulation/jtchlu5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1690260846.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1690260846.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jtbe5gn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Aggressive_Leek_6281", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jt8eigz", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_btsfxuzx", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I did darkroom but I only saw visual snows that last for a minute or less.\n\nI think my internal dialogue (and bad subconscious habits I picked up from my Muggle family) is preventing me from seeing magic.\n\nAnd scary stories and movies I've read and watched made me fear the unknown, including darkness.\n\nSo all I'm doing now is forcing silence 2 hours a day but with no success yet.

And my hand would raise up on occasion, and point at something, all by itself.\n\nBut the gaze itself is a feeling I picked up recapitulating, thus it's a \"recapitulation gaze\".\n\nI discovered how to use it in darkness by having trouble with my inventory getting stuck on a particular thing from time to time.

It seems like each time she returns, she brings a different quality of purple fog.\n\nThe gaze cut through it.  It also turned out to be the best way to slowly scan the room for dreams I could intercept.\n\nTo know what it \"feels like\", you'd have to be familiar with the second attention.\n\nIf you're meditating, and suddenly something \"turns on the lights\" inside you, and you can actually see the room with your eyes closed, that's the feeling of the second attention.\n\nThis gaze is burning with it, intensely. But it can only focus on a point, or on a vertical line. It can't gaze at everything, the way fern gazing might be. Where you flood your eyes.\n\nIt's not related to seeing the colors, but that's where you want to apply it.  On those colors.\n\nI haven't tried it out on an inorganic, which I guess is why I profit so much from writing here.  I only just realized that now.\n\nCholita ran again, maybe an inorganic will come out to play and I'll see what it thinks of this gaze.\n\nAnother use for it is to expand an intercepted dream, from floor to ceiling.  In that case, you visualize a vertical line, where your point gaze is located.  Instead of a point, you *see* a line.  I mean, literally see it.\n\nThat \"flattens\" any dream you're watching, and it exists in full height.  Otherwise, intercepted dreams tend to focus on the \"important\" details, such as the person's face, hands, and what they're doing.\n\nThe feet tend to get lost in that.\n\nI would have loved to see which shoes Cholita wears in dreaming.  I bought her some expensive sandals, and then she found better ones on Rodeo Drive, and tossed the first ones out.  \n\nHer and Margarete had a thing about expensive shoes.  Somehow Cholita ended up with a few of Margarete's clothes.\n\nLast night when she ran to union station, I found her in a bar.\n\nShe started speaking continuously, saying very strange things. She wouldn't stop.\n\nI realized, she was *seeing*!  And she was just repeating what she *saw*.\n\nBut she took a fancy to the bar tender, and spoke to him in Spanish telling him I couldn't get an erection.\n\nWhen I assured her I could, she kept insisting I had to get it out right here and show it.  On the stool at the bar.\n\nIf it does turn out Cholita can deliver the inorganics to people elsewhere, whoever gets stuck watching her for a few days is in for some good practice at being silent.

It also turned out to be the best way to slowly scan the room for dreams I could intercept.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To know what it &amp;quot;feels like&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;d have to be familiar with the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re meditating, and suddenly something &amp;quot;turns on the lights&amp;quot; inside you, and you can actually see the room with your eyes closed, that&amp;#39;s the feeling of the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This gaze is burning with it, intensely. But it can only focus on a point, or on a vertical line. It can&amp;#39;t gaze at everything, the way fern gazing might be. Where you flood your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not related to seeing the colors, but that&amp;#39;s where you want to apply it.  On those colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t tried it out on an inorganic, which I guess is why I profit so much from writing here.  I only just realized that now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita ran again, maybe an inorganic will come out to play and I&amp;#39;ll see what it thinks of this gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another use for it is to expand an intercepted dream, from floor to ceiling.  In that case, you visualize a vertical line, where your point gaze is located.  Instead of a point, you &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; a line.  I mean, literally see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That &amp;quot;flattens&amp;quot; any dream you&amp;#39;re watching, and it exists in full height.  Otherwise, intercepted dreams tend to focus on the &amp;quot;important&amp;quot; details, such as the person&amp;#39;s face, hands, and what they&amp;#39;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The feet tend to get lost in that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would have loved to see which shoes Cholita wears in dreaming.  I bought her some expensive sandals, and then she found better ones on Rodeo Drive, and tossed the first ones out.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her and Margarete had a thing about expensive shoes.  Somehow Cholita ended up with a few of Margarete&amp;#39;s clothes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night when she ran to union station, I found her in a bar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She started speaking continuously, saying very strange things. She wouldn&amp;#39;t stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, she was &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;!  And she was just repeating what she &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she took a fancy to the bar tender, and spoke to him in Spanish telling him I couldn&amp;#39;t get an erection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I assured her I could, she kept insisting I had to get it out right here and show it.  On the stool at the bar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it does turn out Cholita can deliver the inorganics to people elsewhere, whoever gets stuck watching her for a few days is in for some good practice at being silent. If you have a weakness, Cholita will figure it out, and stick her finger in it hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_em769l", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/em769l/another_view_on_recapitulation/fdol4h6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1578607340.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1578607340.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fdocs75", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "jd198703", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1578602803.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fdnt6ei", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3tl0tnl8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Can you be more specific about the recapitulation gaze?

I've heard all of those tidbits from Carlos' students, or from the witches.\n\nCarlos himself was a bit quiet about recap details.  One time Taisha had to step in, because Carlos wasn't answering someone's question, and it became a tiny bit rude.\n\n(Actually it was a skillful stalking maneuver on his part, but it wasn't obvious at the time.)\n\nI'll add that the sweeping of the head is also a gazing technique. You are essentially brightening up the memories as your gaze scans, due to the head turning.  As you try to visualize it, that activates the gaze.\n\nIt's not a gaze of this world. It's a gaze directly into the second attention, meaning, your visualization of the details of memories.  Visualizing summons intent, to produce the details.\n\nAs a result, that gaze is not as grounded in the Tonal, as the one you would pick up by gazing at ferns.\n\nIt's only connected to the second attention.\n\nThat recapitulation gaze is portable!\n\nBut don't forget the feel of the sweeping. Although the intensity of the recapitulation gaze can be duplicated without moving the head, it works best with the slow sweep.\n\nIf you use it without the head sweep, and intensify it, you can burn a hole into the darkness, and pull objects from it.  Or better put, you don't stop the head sweep. Instead, you sweep forward, extremely slowly.   Like pushing a dagger into the darkness.\n\nNot too much! It's more *intent*.  If your head literally moves forward, it's only a few millimeters.\n\nYou will literally see the blackness burning away, and light intensifying around the edges of the hole you are creating with your gaze.  It will not be vague.  No imagination is required!\n\nYou will burn a hole in reality with this gaze!\n\nThings are present right on the other side, and you can intend them to pop up a bit so you can see what they are.  I'd describe what you can find, but that will color the *intent* of people who try this.\n\nThe real thing is very fun!   I hope some of you stop posturing, and do enough work to get the real thing.\n\nDon't rise through the ranks!  Rise in knowledge instead.\n\nThe recapitulation gaze can also be used to locate the intent of dreamers, so you can share their dream.  Greatly slow down the sweep in that case, and if you highlight a detail in the darkness, let it remain there until it fully forms into a dream.\n\nTo intercept dreams, the gaze has to contain your will to recognize things. It's not quite like burning a hole into the darkness, but the gaze feels the same.\n\nOnce you learn the recapitulation gaze, you'll also discover that ANY movement of your body redeploys energy. Carlos wasn't making that up!  Just raise your arm, and you'll see a flurry of purple light.\n\nIf you end up doing this yourself, keep in mind, that kind of sensitivity takes a lot of practice time in darkness.  At first, you might indeed see colors, but you still won't realize that any movement redeploys energy.  But just keep it up and you will.\n\nYou can apply that gaze to viewing the Tensegrity in darkness, and you'll discover that Carlos was sort of playing around with what \"special effects\" could be generated.\n\nFor example, when you make a circle on the floor with your foot, it causes vague light down there to brighten, and swirl around.  It literally looks like you just swept some purple floor dust into the air.\n\nWhen you do the 2nd dreaming technique from the Westwood series, you can see the energy behind you as vague purple and grey light. It's dispersed.   The movement causes it to gather more, and the tension in the legs seems to push it forward. When you look back to the front, there's a definite cloud of light at your waist, and if you gaze into it, dreaming images form.\n\nThe darned thing works every time once you can get silent!  I'll propose that as a test for  those learning. When you can see dreaming (hypnogogic) images produced by doing that tensegrity move,  your second attention is well on it's way to integrating with your first.\n\nMy theory is, Carlos wanted us to view those \"special effects\", and let our assemblage points drift to heightened awareness as a result of the fireworks show coming from the tensegrity.\n\nIn other words, he was physically doing what I keep saying, which is, we don't need a nagual to push our assemblage point.  If you get silent and find something to watch, which doesn't come from this normal world, watching it will move your assemblage point.\n\nBut, and here's the key:  You  have to learn to be silent or you won't ***see*** the energy.  And without silence, the assemblage point can't drift from the view.\n\nYour seeing will be really crummy in the beginning, but as you find more and more details in the darkness, your assemblage point will move and they'll brighten up.\n\nIf you can't *see* the energy, it can' t pull your assemblage point further into heightened awareness.  And full on heightened awareness is the same thing as \"enlightenment\".  But the best part is, you'll know the answers to everything, without anyone having to tell you.\n\n(Or at least, you'll think you do.)\n\nAbout the recapitulation gaze:  Cholita taught it to me.  I'm sad to say, after coming home for one day,  to return the stolen rental car,  she's fled through the train system again.\n\nThese days she seems to be a fully functioning scout.  She runs off, comes back, and I get stuff as a result.\n\nThen she takes off again.\n\nAnd, she brought me this gaze a trip or two ago. \n\nThere isn't just one kind of gazing, but I'm at a loss to explain the differences.  It's something about the *intent*.\n\nIt makes sense, because switching to the second attention energy body was taught to Carlos by Silvio Manuel, and all it was, was a gaze downwards at the right side of the stomach.\n\nMaybe it's about the specific shine of the eyes, something you begin to feel, when your gaze can light up energy.\n\nA warning!!!!!\n\nRecapitulation does **not** \"clear\" you, similar to Scientology. If you're starting to see it that way, you're worse off than if you don't do it at all.  That will greatly heed your progress in becoming a sorcerer for real, as opposed to merely rising up in an organization.\n\nIt does **not** eliminate ego!  Carlos was the same asshole when he first met don Juan, as he was at the end of his life.  Nor are any of the chacmools free from ego.\n\nThat's a total misunderstanding of sorcery.\n\nIt just means, when you screw up again, and you will, you screw up for a little less time.\n\nYou don't fuss as long, before you get over it.\n\nWhen you take an inventory, as the eagle commands, you won't worship it as much. So you'll be silent faster.\n\nIf you want to eliminate the ego, you have to lose the human form.\n\nFor that you need silence.\n\nAnd afterwards, you'll still be an asshole.  You'll just be a relatively empty asshole.\n\nThere's no reason for mental trips and fake spirituality.\n\nThere's real inorganic beings out there to play with, and alternate worlds you can enter.\n\nStop posturing if you want the real thing.  Recap can help you figure out why you're such a needy person, so that you can find out what exactly is motivating you to accept mental substitutes, for the real thing.\n\n(A message to our best hope to preserve Carlos' knowledge, in Russia.)\n\nEdit eight", "edited": 1578599349.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fdnt6ei", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cool!

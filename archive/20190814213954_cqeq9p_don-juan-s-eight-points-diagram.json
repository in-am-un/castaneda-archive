Two  of  them,  reason  and talking,  are  known  by  everyone.  Feeling  is  always  vague  but  somehow  familiar.  But  only  in  the world  of  sorcerers  does  one  get  fully  acquainted  with  dreaming,  seeing  and  will.  And  finally,  at the  outer  edge  of  that  world  one  encounters  the  other  two.

He  showed  me  that  they  were connected  only  to  \"will\"  and  that  they  were  removed  from  \"feeling,\"  \"dreaming\"  and  \"seeing,\" and  much  more  distant  from  \"talking\"  and  \"reason.\"  He  pointed  with  his  finger  to  show  that  they were  isolated from  the  rest  and from  each other.\n\n\"Those  two  points  will  never  yield  to  talking  or  to  reason\"  he  said.  \"Only  will  can  handle them.  Reason  is  so  removed  from  them  that  it  is  utterly  useless  to  try  figuring  them  out.  This  is one  of  the  hardest  things  to realize;  after  all, the  forte  of  reason  is  to reason out  everything.\"\n\nI  asked him  if  the  eight  points  corresponded to areas  or  to certain organs  in a  human being.\n\n\"They do,\"  he  replied dryly and erased the  diagram. He  touched  my  head  and  said  that  that  was  the  center  of  \"reason\"  and  \"talking\".  The  tip  of  my sternum  was  the  center  of  feeling.  The  area  below  the  navel  was  will.

I have an entire house made of gingerbread and candy!\"\n\nAnd for god only knows what reason, people fall for it.  You'd think they'd want to see the house first.  Make sure it's not just a candy fa\u00e7ade.\n\nThen talk to some kids who visited recently, and see what they experienced.\n\nBut no...\n\nInstead, they'll lynch anyone who even suggests that's not a wise old grandmother you've been talking to.\n\nWait...\n\nIt's a WITCH!!!\n\nMaybe I picked the wrong analogy.\n\nWitches good.  Gurus bad.\n\nBut I suppose you have the idea.\n\nNOTHING out there will help you.  Most will greatly harm you.\n\nYea but...  You say.\n\nYes,  yes.   Some of them have tiny bits of magic.  I suppose you could say, that evil old woman who wants to toss children in her oven, does in fact have a box of tic-tacs.  I believe she keeps it in her bra.  In case she has to deal with older children.\n\nBut that's about it.\n\nShe'll make your breath \"Minty Fresh\".\n\nBut you won't get the candy.  No one does.\n\nWe lost our only double male to that trick.  He's off looking for the house of Candy, so he can settle in with the Dali Lama.\n\nAnd get the respect and admiration he rightly deserves!\n\nSo we're stuck with ourselves for a guide.\n\nWhich seems hopeless.\n\nBut in fact, that's the ONLY way you can learn sorcery.\n\nIt can't be taught.\n\nI didn't say you can't motivate people.  So that they become their own guide.\n\nBut teaching it is  useless.  If it weren't so, there would be a little \"pamphlet\".\n\nMaybe rolled up in pretty red cellophane, like a toy.\n\nThe Jehovah's witnesses used to do that.  Make their propaganda look like a pretty toy, so that children couldn't resist it if they got near the bench at the bus stop.\n\nI never got to see a bus pull up, a Jehovah's witness run down, place the \"scrolls\" on the bench, then get back on the bus.\n\nFor the next stop.\n\nBut that must be how they do it.\n\nThe Buddhist Temple has a much worse trick in Taipei.\n\nThey have a guy who sells firecrackers, within very short distance of the \"Daoist Sorcerer\", who typically is on stilts.  The kids get to buy firecrackers, and toss them at the magical man.  See that he's impervious to harm, due to his amazing Daoist sage wisdom. He can actually pronounce Dantian!!!\n\nHe from what I've been told, by old Chinese men who know the religious systems in Asia well, he really does have the \"liquor\",  if you know what I mean.  Likely Baijiu. \n\nMeanwhile, Dad doesn't mind paying for the firecrackers.\n\nThe temple hires high school cheerleaders, to dance near the sorcerers.  In bikinis.  But they have some restraint.  The junior high girls have to wear their cheerleader outfit.\n\nI only know about this because my Taiwanese boss is a big deal in Taipei, and gets to be one of only 4 who carry the \"magical chest\" into which the Taoist master puts exorcised demons.\n\nIt's an honor to be a \"magical chest bearer\".\n\nAt any rate, the Daoists can \"teach\" you magic.\n\nI can't.  \n\nCarlos couldn't.  \n\nCleargreen didn't.\n\nYou have to teach yourself!\n\nAnd it starts with emphasizing *intent*.  Learn about it.  Use the *intent* Carlos \"hid\" in the tensegrity.\n\nAvoid turning into the Buddha in your darkroom.\n\nJust sitting there, looking wise.\n\nIt doesn't work well.  You \"sink\" into a daydreaming phantom reality.\n\nAt least, in the orange zone that's what happens.\n\nI wish we knew some \"orange zone\" tensegrity, but so far no one's mapped the moves like that.\n\nI just use a technique Cholita showed me, which creates \"dents\".\n\nBut I'm sure there are tensegrity moves specifically designed with the right *intent* to use in the orange zone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "For the New AND the Old", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"l7sm8w1t39u71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l7sm8w1t39u71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1cc00fd3302f3aa997a637952f5123cb8d34254"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l7sm8w1t39u71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da4a4c4efe0c227cea1ca134001d3972f6a59760"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l7sm8w1t39u71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1f030d94bb6a24d78b4309563e10e536624a5ee"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l7sm8w1t39u71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e014378b5a6a0851d824568c33dc783136fdbb77"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l7sm8w1t39u71.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b79f132d164271c4bcc293562f131417040b9e5b"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l7sm8w1t39u71.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f725a1be7513cb70ca0246de84a6c8c6b12db38a"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l7sm8w1t39u71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=735b3d8fa8cd938480abcc728b73f691db708e0b"}, "id": "l7sm8w1t39u71"}}, "name": "t3_qasza5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Q8Hk0B2R_2RtXmzim8IJLtwFj9p0STZbHR5BfSExH_8.jpg", "edited": 1634583218.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1634582338.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/l7sm8w1t39u71.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=735b3d8fa8cd938480abcc728b73f691db708e0b\"&gt;If you forget to emphasis what Elias said makes intent happy, you&amp;#39;ll weaken over time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the deal...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; out there, brainwashes their students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It works, because they promise them magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They say, &amp;quot;Come little children.

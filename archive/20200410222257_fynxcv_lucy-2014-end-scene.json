Others have other maters like families,jobs,hobbies and have no time for magics.\n\nI like to say that, but in fact there's some kind of \"group flier's mind\" phenomena.\n\nI still don't believe in the fliers, but I've seen groups of people rise up and do very ugly things, to suppress magic.\n\nAnd that's in our heads too.  That strange urge to suppress magic.\n\nLast night, I assembled 3 new worlds I'd never seen, manifested several dreams, played with hypnogogic images as much as I wanted,  reached a level of silence right on the edge of stopping the world, conjured up rooms in other places so I could try to enter in my dreaming body, and continued to try to learn how to switch my eyes to see energy instead of physical matter.\n\nI got to the point of seeing the entire lower half of my body as pure energy, located in some stationary place.\n\nAnd the whole time, I felt like it wasn't working.    \n\nProbably just about the same feeling any of you gets when you first start out, trying to learn to be silent in the chair, and nothing is happening.\n\nIt's a desire to stop, and go do something else.\n\nDon't expect that to go away until you lose the human form.\n\nAfter that, who knows.  \n\nThe human form is a feeling, beaten into us by our parents.\n\nWe're suffering from Stockholm syndrome.  Or PTSD perhaps.\n\nIf you get rid of that, does every bad motive go away?\n\nI don't know.  Maybe you always have to be on guard for a bad attitude.\n\n&gt;But I am able to find 1.5-2hr daily\n\nIf you can find even 1 hour at first, you can work harder during that hour, and make it as good as 2.\n\nAnd that will be enough to push you over the edge, so you don\u2019t have any doubts it\u2019s real.\n\nUnfortunately, if you stop you return to doubts.  The doubts aren\u2019t an ordinary kind, like not believing your friend is really going to pay back that loan.\n\nIf you get 3 loan payments from him,  your doubt is mostly gone. He\u2019ll have to miss one, to bring it back.\n\nBut it\u2019s not like that with sorcery. The doubts come from this current position of our assemblage points.\n\nIf you stop practicing, it returns here, and the doubts come back.\n\nSorcery is NOT like anything else we learn. That\u2019s why people seem to be making a lot of mistakes.\n\nThey think you can \u201clearn\u201d it.  But you can only \u201cdo\u201d it, yourself.  Inch by inch.\n\n(Because we have no Nagual to help.)\n\n&gt;Are you talking about this magic passes company ClearGreen?\n\nYes.  \n\nCleargreen is in fact what Carlos created, in order to put us on the correct path with *intent*.\n\nSo that\u2019s the place to go if you can afford it. Get hooked up.\n\nIf you can't afford it, or it's too far away, Carlos\u2019 tensegrity book would work too.  The *intent* is in the comments.\n\nBut I don\u2019t believe Cleargreen actually believes anyone could learn to do what\u2019s written in Carlos\u2019 books.  At least, not anymore.\n\nI\u2019d expect them to call me delusional if someone pressed it.  \n\nWith no ability to demonstrate, or talk intelligently about the real magic of Tensegrity, they\u2019ve added on other fussy things.\n\nAnd teacher training.  Teacher training is a death sentence for a movement. \n\nIt means, they ran out of things to sell, so they\u2019re finding people who want a certificate, so they can feel better about themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s the ultimate placebo!\n\nAnd yet, it\u2019s not so bad for the movement, as long as we can get a few of you to do impossible things daily.\n\nI've seen Carlos read the future at least twice.  He looked off to the south, slightly up 15 degrees from horizon, and just stated something matter of factually, which he couldn't possibly know.\n\nMaybe he foresaw what would happen with Cleargreen too.\n\n\n&gt;We shouldnt do that?\n\nYou should do what\u2019s written in Carlos\u2019 books.  Go ahead and be impeccable.\n\nMy reaction to that is, weren\u2019t you before?  Why do you need someone telling you to do your best?\n\nBut yes, go ahead.\n\nJust don\u2019t count it as learning.  \n\nNo, Carlos did not advise cutting sugar.  He conducted a three month experiment, requesting us not to eat sugar, fruit, drink coffee, not to take our prozac, anti-depressants, or take any stimulants of any sort.\n\nWhen Carlos gave us a \"group assignment\", you could always see that it was actually focused on someone in his inner circle.  He was tinkering with one of them, and just extended it to everyone, to make sure that person (or persons) would not feel like they were being singled out.\n\nHis head would turn halfway towards the person in question, as if to \"give them a nod\" of recognition.\n\nI could tell you exactly who the sugar thing was about, if I wasn't face blind.\n\nBut I do have the memory that Ellis was involved, as far as the pill department went.  One of the women came up to me afterwards, and mentioned that the ban included medications, as long as your doctor doesn't insist you have to keep taking your crazy pills.\n\nIn other words, it was stimulants and mind altering drugs.  Not sugar.\n\nIt had no noticeable effect, so he just stopped talking about it.  \n\nBut he invited me to his house, and gave me a sugary treat one time.  \n\nI suspect the chacmools think this is important, because Carlos used it as a stalking maneuver.  The same way he convinced Kylie that she can\u2019t spend so much time in the bathroom because water is dangerous.\n\nImagine 3 chacmools fighting over the bathroom.\n\nI have my hands full with just one Cholita.\n\nAs for the sugar, maybe he didn\u2019t want them to get fat. \n\nOr maybe when they behaved badly, he could point it out without hurting their feelings, because you can ALWAYS find some sugar someone ate in the last day or two.\n\nInstead of saying, \"What you just did was horrible!  You're a bad person!!!\", he could say, \"Ah Hah!  It's that sugar you ate last night!  That's why you're acting like a bad person!!!\"\n\nPsyc 101?  \n\nThe bad thing about sugar is just the calories.  You can guzzle down 500, and not even fill up.\n\nAnd don't get me started about Bob's Big Boy Chocolate fudge cake with vanilla ice cream! \n\nI guarantee Carlos stared at one of those, in front of himself, at least a time or two.\n\nBob's was a chain that was really popular when Carlos was active with don Juan.  And all over that region of southern California, such as near Morongo.\n\nIt was kind of like \"Ship's\", which he mentions in a couple of his books. He had an apartment next to Ship's.\n\nHe headed there, after losing don Juan.\n\n1200 calories in those fudge cakes!\n\nBut fruit sugar is just as bad as refined, unless you want to pretend we have nutritional deficiencies, and need that fiber in those pears.\n\nNo one in this country has nutritional deficiencies!  We have excessive food, that's what we have.\n\nStarches are even worse than sugars. That's well known in Asia, where they have a high rate of diabetes from too much rice consumption.\n\nThe anti-sugar campaign is not based on science.  \n\nIt\u2019s more controlling behavior, so that adding it onto the \u201csorcerer\u2019s agenda\u201d is a bad thing.\n\nWe're trying to REDUCE our internal dialogues, not super charge them!\n\n&gt;And your general idea is to focus on essence in practical stuff, not on \"feng shui\" distractions, yep?\n\nCholita is more powerful than I, and she\u2019s 100% feng shui distractions.\n\nBut she\u2019s a fluke.  And she can\u2019t even take care of herself.\n\nWhat you should focus on is finding one single thing you can do, which moves your assemblage point.\n\nAnd move it as far as you can, using that.  When it doesn\u2019t work anymore, you\u2019ll probably have found the next thing.\n\nThat's how people learned in Carlos' books. Not by pretending or refraining from sugar.\n\nI\u2019ve seen success with this path:\n\nFern gazing until you learn this: Yes, the second attention can do weird things when you gaze.\n\nThat led several people to think maybe it\u2019s worth it to learn to get silent, using the sitting in a chair technique.\n\nOnce they learned to get silent, and discovered the assemblage point does in fact exist, they began to get good at waking dreaming.  But with eyes closed.\n\nLater they started to integrate that knowledge into other things.  Especially finding colors that shouldn't be there.\n\nBut you should see some real progress almost every time you practice, even if the progress is realizing, you can\u2019t shut your internal dialogue off for more than 10 seconds.\n\nThis is also progress:  You sit and try to force yourself silent, and fail miserably all night long.\n\nBelieve it or not, that's more progress than a little success.  \n\nNot that you don't need to win occasionally.\n\nWhat is NOT real progress, is denying yourself sugar, behaving badly under the guise of stalking, being secretive and not open to sharing knowledge with others, because you are \"erasing personal history\".\n\nMemorizing more and more tensegrity moves, before you can even see one of them, is not much progress.  Some. But not enough to save you from giving up eventually.\n\nProgress is when you can say to yourself, \u201cThis really works!!!\u201d\n\nEdited three times", "edited": 1586726489.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fn3swkj", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe,theyre just lazy and not motivated enough?

That strange urge to suppress magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night, I assembled 3 new worlds I&amp;#39;d never seen, manifested several dreams, played with hypnogogic images as much as I wanted,  reached a level of silence right on the edge of stopping the world, conjured up rooms in other places so I could try to enter in my dreaming body, and continued to try to learn how to switch my eyes to see energy instead of physical matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got to the point of seeing the entire lower half of my body as pure energy, located in some stationary place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the whole time, I felt like it wasn&amp;#39;t working.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably just about the same feeling any of you gets when you first start out, trying to learn to be silent in the chair, and nothing is happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a desire to stop, and go do something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t expect that to go away until you lose the human form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, who knows.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The human form is a feeling, beaten into us by our parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re suffering from Stockholm syndrome.  Or PTSD perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get rid of that, does every bad motive go away?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know.  Maybe you always have to be on guard for a bad attitude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But I am able to find 1.5-2hr daily&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can find even 1 hour at first, you can work harder during that hour, and make it as good as 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that will be enough to push you over the edge, so you don\u2019t have any doubts it\u2019s real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if you stop you return to doubts.  The doubts aren\u2019t an ordinary kind, like not believing your friend is really going to pay back that loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get 3 loan payments from him,  your doubt is mostly gone. He\u2019ll have to miss one, to bring it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it\u2019s not like that with sorcery. The doubts come from this current position of our assemblage points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you stop practicing, it returns here, and the doubts come back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is NOT like anything else we learn. That\u2019s why people seem to be making a lot of mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They think you can \u201clearn\u201d it.  But you can only \u201cdo\u201d it, yourself.  Inch by inch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Because we have no Nagual to help.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are you talking about this magic passes company ClearGreen?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cleargreen is in fact what Carlos created, in order to put us on the correct path with &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that\u2019s the place to go if you can afford it.

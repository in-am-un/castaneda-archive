And the content was:\n\nFor the longest time I didn\u2019t understand why CC was so elaborate when it came to stalking. Why would anyone want to stalk someone? Although CC said stalking is about learning who you are as a person\u2014not self actualization\u2014but to learn your habits and vulnerabilities. But he never was too direct about saying why other than creating a shroud of mystery around yourself, but that always came off as something only a james bond character would do. Over the years however, I learned that the people around you learn to manipulate you because they think they know who you are and what you\u2019ll assume. This is why learning the art of stalking is important: it\u2019s about showing not the world, but specific individuals who you want them to think you are so you can manipulate them instead. Psychopaths are naturals at this but most aren\u2019t ruthless enough to try stalking to a pathological degree.\n  \n\n  \nOne day last November, a weird wave or command you might say pass through me. I felt very fluid and knew exactly what to do and how to do it. That day anything was possible and I was in a mood of complete abandon. I had stopped a medication I was on for many years and was constipated. Most people would go to CVS and by a laxative and call it a day. However, having a mother whom is chronically constipated, I knew much about constipation and I knew what I was in for, and wanted the good stuff. Not only that, I had not been to my primary in a several years, and decided I would get the works done: a CAT scan, EKG, ultrasound, blood and urine sample analysis, blood pressure, even things I didn\u2019t know existed\u2014I wanted it all done. I pay through the roof for sugar daddy healthcare each month and could do all these things, but I wanted it done in an hour at the time and traffic alone would be an hour drive to the hospital. So I pulled off what I never had done before which was change my image into someone who was near death by moving my assemblage point to the place of death.\n  \n\n  \nI called a Lyft driver because the first question I knew they would ask is if I had drove to the hospital, and when I got in the car, the driver could sense that I was in an emergency state but not because I was hysterical or panicked but because I moved his assemblage point when I stepped into the car and he didn\u2019t have to ask me anything. I only said I was going to the hospital and smiled. He drove 90mph on city streets and the HOV lane and I arrived to urgent care in 15 minutes from across town during rush hour. When you are close to death that last place you go is to the emergency room. I learned this because my grandfather bled out and died in one and the staff could have cared less. When urgent care took my pulse and temperature, they were so high that they put me in a wheel chair and escorted me to the emergency room. There, my pupils were so dilated and tears were now involuntary and I could no longer speak. The emergency room was completely full but I spent maybe three minutes there before I was inside the ICU. From there I became catatonic and don\u2019t remember much after that; and an hour later I was back on the street at night feeling right as rain as if nothing had ever happened. I had $12,000 worth of medical care done in less than an hour, had the whole ICU convinced I was toast, and then when the tests I wanted were done, intent simply moved my assemblage point back to \u201cme\u201d and I walked out without a care in the world. The visit only cost me $100 and I had my perfect bill of health.\n  \n\n  \nI never questioned CC again in my mind in regard to when DJ made himself senile and forced CC to become a different person himself. Sorcerers don\u2019t pretend or act in this regard, they truly transform into whatever intent dictates they need to be. For some reason, the position of death is the easiest configuration for me, but I\u2019ve been using sleep deprivation to learn other spots. Your last enemy in life is truly fear, it\u2019s what keeps the assemblage point in place. In my opinion, the \u201cDark Room\u201d is overrated\u2014go without sleep for 72 hours instead, a trick I learned from my schizo mother who only sleeps 2 hours a day. It forces your entire body to do magical things to keep you alive and you become an entirely different person and truly ruthless, capable of opening the gate of intent. Personally, I\u2019ve never had a breakthrough by playing with imagery in the dark, but maybe that\u2019s just me.\n  \n\n  \nYesterday was a big day for me, maybe. I was wrapping up a 72hr session and I walked outside for a smoke and all the sudden a wave passed through me and I felt the gravity of my own body about 50% greater. I walked back inside because I was about to crash and closed my eyes and that\u2018s when I saw my luminous cocoon. It was a stereographic projection of a Hopf fibration that was a yellowish glow, that was made of filaments of light. Maybe Dan can correct me if I\u2019m wrong about the geometry, but here\u2019s a good educational video describing what a Hopf fibration is here. I wasn\u2019t surprised by this experience because I feel it\u2019s in line with much of what CC has said over the years to varying degrees. It\u2019s entirely possible that I was experiencing something different, so for the sake of science, I welcome the reader to dispute or confirm this experience. If I did in fact see emanations of my luminous cocoon (it makes sense that would be the first thing you learn to see), then I\u2019ll pat myself on the back, ha.\n  \n\n  \nTLDR; Thanks for reading this wall of text and long story short: try sleep deprivation over the \u201cdark room\u201d and the luminous cocoon may be a Hopf fibration, which I leave to the youtube link to fully describe.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20210206093645/https://old.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/irndn6/a_stalker_talk_hopf_fibrations_and_sleep/", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kgvfw1b", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Stalker Talk, Hopf Fibrations, and Sleep Deprivation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, was the OP title of this post.

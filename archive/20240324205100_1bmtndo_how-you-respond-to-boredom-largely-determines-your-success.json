Analyzing over 10,000 participants in 68 studies, the research found no significant difference in distraction levels across various tasks. This phenomenon persists even without external distractions like phones or social media, emphasizing an inherent vulnerability in human attention...\n\n...The longer a person spends on a task, the more their mind starts to wander regardless of whether the activity is difficult or easy. In fact, toward the end of the task, individuals are typically thinking about something else at least 50 percent of the time, according to a new University of Miami study.\n\n\\[**it's important to understand that all of the individuals in this study were stuck at the Blue Line on the**  [**J-Curve**](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/terminology/j-curve/)**. Things get easier, and not harder, as we continue with the intent to** [**silence the inner monologue**](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/silence)**...and thus move along the J-Curve \\]**\n\nThe findings,\u00a0published in the journal\u00a0*Psychological Bulletin*, represent the most comprehensive research to date on typical rates of mind-wandering while completing tasks. While some people are better at staying focused than others, everyone\u2019s mind tends to wander more frequently over time, the researchers found.\n\n\\[**also, we are all born with differing reserves of** [**dreaming attention**](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/18xtgg6/comment/kg6keys/)**\\]**\n\n\u201cYou might expect that it\u2019s harder for people to pay attention during more\u00a0difficult tasks\u00a0or that maybe during easy tasks, people feel bored, and their mind wanders more. However, we didn\u2019t find any systematic differences between those types of tasks. Our (Blue Line) minds wander more and more regardless of what we are doing...\u201d\n\n...Participants in these studies completed tasks of varying types and difficulty while researchers periodically interrupted them to check on their level of focus. These tasks mostly took place in quiet environments with no outside distractions.\n\n\u201c**We often blame our phones or social media for why we are distracted. But our minds will drag us off-task even without these external distractions,**\u201d Zanesco said.\n\nThe findings have wide-ranging implications outside the lab. Previous research has indicated that performance tends to worsen over time in tasks that require us to stay focused. But the reasons for this decline are still unknown (\ud83e\udd23). Researchers have proposed several possibilities for our short attention spans, including that our minds tend to wander to our thoughts more frequently over time.\n\nZanesco and his colleagues investigated this question directly. Their research suggests that our tendency to get stuck thinking about something other than what we are currently doing may be one reason why we struggle to pay attention. **Finding effective strategies for curtailing mind-wandering is an important next step (like** [**darkroom games**](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/gamer)**)**\n\n\u201cThis kind of research can make us aware that our attention is vulnerable,\u201d Zanesco said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we recognize that our attention can be vulnerable and that we have a strong tendency toward mind-wandering so we can work to guard against it.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAdditional Journal Article -

In fact, toward the end of the task, individuals are typically thinking about something else at least 50 percent of the time, according to a new University of Miami study.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;it&amp;#39;s important to understand that all of the individuals in this study were stuck at the Blue Line on the&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/terminology/j-curve/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J-Curve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Things get easier, and not harder, as we continue with the intent to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/silence\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;silence the inner monologue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...and thus move along the J-Curve ]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The findings,\u00a0published in the journal\u00a0&lt;em&gt;Psychological Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, represent the most comprehensive research to date on typical rates of mind-wandering while completing tasks. While some people are better at staying focused than others, everyone\u2019s mind tends to wander more frequently over time, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;also, we are all born with differing reserves of&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/18xtgg6/comment/kg6keys/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dreaming attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou might expect that it\u2019s harder for people to pay attention during more\u00a0difficult tasks\u00a0or that maybe during easy tasks, people feel bored, and their mind wanders more. However, we didn\u2019t find any systematic differences between those types of tasks. Our (Blue Line) minds wander more and more regardless of what we are doing...\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...Participants in these studies completed tasks of varying types and difficulty while researchers periodically interrupted them to check on their level of focus. These tasks mostly took place in quiet environments with no outside distractions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c&lt;strong&gt;We often blame our phones or social media for why we are distracted. But our minds will drag us off-task even without these external distractions,&lt;/strong&gt;\u201d Zanesco said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The findings have wide-ranging implications outside the lab. Previous research has indicated that performance tends to worsen over time in tasks that require us to stay focused. But the reasons for this decline are still unknown (\ud83e\udd23). Researchers have proposed several possibilities for our short attention spans, including that our minds tend to wander to our thoughts more frequently over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zanesco and his colleagues investigated this question directly. Their research suggests that our tendency to get stuck thinking about something other than what we are currently doing may be one reason why we struggle to pay attention. &lt;strong&gt;Finding effective strategies for curtailing mind-wandering is an important next step (like&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/gamer\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;darkroom games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis kind of research can make us aware that our attention is vulnerable,\u201d Zanesco said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we recognize that our attention can be vulnerable and that we have a strong tendency toward mind-wandering so we can work to guard against it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additional Journal Article - &amp;quot;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4217586/\"&gt;On The Function of

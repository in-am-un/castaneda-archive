But then I couldn't resist rearranging the order of the pictures, which required explanatory text.\n\nSo I guess it's a done post now, except I can't afford the time tonight to fix errors.\n\nIt's about something anyone who has activated the second attention knows, but possibly never thought about in this way.\n\nIf you gaze out into the world, imagine that there's a 4th dimension.\n\nInto the Nagual.  Into the wonders that your double gets to witness, with its powerful sleeping dreamer eyes.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine, since if you can move your assemblage point along the J curve, your \"space\" begins to be multiple spaces.\n\nYou might be seeing a forest materialize on your darkroom wall, while you can still perceive that you are in  your normal darkroom.\n\nOn a very good day you can walk right off into that forest, through the solid wall.  In your physical body it seems at the time.\n\nBut that's not the main point of this post. It's the fact that the forest is located in another \"dimension\".\n\nSome kind of gazing \"depth\".\n\nIn its most basic form, it's like practicing meditation and you know things are about to get more interesting, because suddenly the blackness you have been watching with your closed eyes, has \"depth\".  It clearly feels like you are gazing into a dark space.  Almost like you are inside a cave, and even though you can't see anything, you can feel that your blackness is now \"3D\".\n\nThat's \"Green Line\" depth into the second attention.\n\nNot much, but people start entire cults and religions over being able to perceive that using meditation.\n\nWith Sorcery, instead of moving the assemblage point just 8 inches down the back, as meditation does, you eventually move it a full 23 FEET.  I calculated it using ChatGPT.\n\nThe \"depth\" available with simple closed eye meditation feels about like 10 feet. Coming from that 8 inch movement.  If you are meditating and suddenly the blackness \"opens up\", and you can feel that it's now a space,  if you were to estimate how large that black space is, meaning how far you could stand up and walk off into it, you might estimate 10 feet.\n\nBut out in the purple zone on the J curve, if you gaze out to figure out how far that 4th dimension of depth into the Nagual reaches, you would start to move.\n\nSitting up on pillows on the bed, you'd find that the bed and the pillows scrolled back and away from you, with you seemingly safe just hovering in the air at the same height, while everything else traveled back on it's own.  With you heading out into outer space, but a space filled with new realities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1p0l2rweqvc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=890a95ff250498ff9fbd4384c076fe10771a8377\n\nNow, before you start drooling (and it is in fact this awesome to be in Silent Knowledge) forget it...\n\nYou don't get to enjoy it the way you're imagining.\n\n\"Enjoying\" things to people who live in the river of shit, means running around \"sharing\" your discovery with friends.\n\nWe can't even enjoy something, without others to run to and grab attention!\n\nIt's the same as bad players who post in this subreddit, and anyone seasoned instantly knows they want attention.  Not magic.\n\nIt's a curse on us so horrible that we can't even conceive of enjoying something just for the enrichment of our own awareness.\n\nWe NEED that attention fix from others.  As someone posted today, we seek the dopamine high of \"sharing\" with others.\n\nTo reach SK, you have to ditch that \"poor baby me\" self obsession.  Not everything has to be a thing you can sell in the marketplace.\n\nEven a hint of the merchant mind kills any possibility you can get to this level of exploration of reality.\n\nThus scratch all religions and magical systems.\n\nIt's hopeless for them. All showbiz, profits and endorsements.\n\nIf any of them stumbled on slightly better magic than the green zone has provided them, they'd waste it all on the idea of \"proving it\" to more people, so they can become famous.\n\nThey kind of have to be stuck with mediocre magic, by the very nature of their systems.  Anything more will stop them from making more progress, by activating their book deal mind. If they rise above whatever endorsement seeking muck they are stuck in, they'll only try to figure out how to lord it over others on that basis.\n\nPutting aside any moral implications, they quite simply can't \"see in the right direction and at the necessary depth\".\n\nAnd even if they tried, their \"depth\" is limited to 10 feet.\n\nThere's no chance for them to shrink their tonal and travel nearly infinite distances in depth, due to the lack of an energy body forming around them.  That can't even begin to happen until the assemblage point is moved at least 12 feet.  Not 8 inches.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dub4lsdufqvc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7554ddca448935e0e8cc0b4e22ec3c5400f5154\n\nTo do the most spectacular things, you have to have your double with you. His eyes are the ones which can focus to anywhere in time and space.\n\nWhich brings me to a key point.  The reason that first picture shows a ghost in a park and a man looking at her.\n\nI couldn't get ChatGPT to draw what I wanted no matter what I told him. He just got more and more lost because he incorporated new ideas into the last failed picture.\n\nBut imagine that park is very full of bushes and people and activity, and the ghost girl is rather hard to see, off in the bushes.\n\nIf he looks away for even an instant, he might not find her spot again.\n\nThat's because in fact, she isn't located in a specific place in the park.  She's absolutely located in the direction of specific bushes and the little clearing in the middle of them, but it's also at a very specific \"depth\" into the Nagual.\n\nInto the second attention.\n\nAnd so even looking off to the left of her to see why people are cheering at their volleyball game in the park, will require him to adjust the \"depth\" he's gazing at, into the multiverse.\n\nThe girl is at \"Possibility 172,486\".  Located between those bushes.\n\nBut the volleyball game is at possibility #1,  in the ordinary blue line reality.\n\nBy having to refocus his depth to see if someone just spiked the ball at an opponent, he's lost the location of #172,486 reality variation.\n\nAnd when he looks back there's no ghost child there anymore.\n\nBelieve it or not, this is why it's so horrible when beginners try to use someone who can move their assemblage point, as an experimental subject.\n\nSuggesting \"why don't you try this for me, and tell me what happens.\"\n\nIt's close to manslaughter to ask someone to do that, because whatever they were currently exploring will be erased by injecting that person's lazy greed into the emanations.\n\nThis insect nest picture is pretty bad, but imagine that we're always reaching towards a specific combination of emanations we've discovered, in the dark sea.  Our darkroom practice stores the \"intent\" of what's happened all the times we practiced it before.\n\nAnd it's \"in depth\".  Your tensegrity pass summons a specific depth into alternate versions of your dark room.\n\nIf you don't do your ritual combination of movements in precisely the same order and same way, as last time,  while remembering your 2nd attention goal during that movement,  you may never find it again.\n\nAfterall, we all get \"intent gifts\" from time to time and discover that even expecting that to happen again is enough to make it impossible.\n\nIt's not the same situation as when it happened the first time, even if all that changed was your expectation.\n\nOur \"depth into the nagual\" is a beam of awareness we don't normally use.  Some kind of \"auxiliary shine\" of our gaze.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qnl4ctr8hqvc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31a40b3f5b946b7a5c3b2647a4eefe702e5d53dc\n\nI'm certain that witches are better equipped to understand this.  Because they have to get involved in self-soothing from time to time. And they develop a ritual, so that they can \"find\" the little sparkle of good feeling which blossomed the last time they managed to soothe themselves.  They \"look for\" some specific sensation while laying in a nice warm bath surrounded by flowers and candles.\n\nOr at least, Cholita does that.\n\nI collided with her 2 days ago, and this post is the result.\n\nThings got really weird as a result.  The power on our side of the street went out, I left my darkroom realizing Cholita would be worried, and found she'd placed little candles in a trail all through the house, leading out and into her work studio.\n\nShe set up a path for me to follow, when I finally left my room.  But didn't disturb me before then.  Since I was already in darkness, it took me a while to figure out we'd lost power.\n\nReluctantly I snuck in the direction she wanted,  worried she had herself thrown off the power switch.\n\n And when I was almost to where the trail of glowing yellow candles ended I heard, \"Daniel... Can you fix this?\"\n\nYou might be saying, \"That's not so odd.\"\n\nBut you're just not realizing what that looked like, with the entire block of our neighborhood blacked out.\n\nIt was the middle of the night.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p89mho7mbqvc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eee43f7d55dc54b1123c0aae842d10e6db3d841c\n\nThe result was literally what you see in this badly made ChatGPT picture. I just couldn't get him to draw what I asked.\n\nBut it conveys the point.\n\nIf you are blowing the flower petals off a dandelion, you have to blow in a certain direction. But also aim for the \"depth\" of the dandelion flower. If you blow \"past\" it, it'll just fall apart in an instant. If you blow too shallow, nothing will happen.  You have to \"aim\" for the center of that flower, if you want to watch the petals fall off a few at a time.\n\nI started my picture request with a little campfire in a hole in a huge chunk of swiss cheese, asking ChatGPT to show that the man was blowing into the hole in the cheese. One of many, but he had identified one where a spark of awareness had created a little campfire surrounded by alien beings, and he was trying to blow the fire brighter so he could see their faces.\n\nBut ChatGPT decided that lighting fires in swiss cheese is dangerous, so he extracted the fire into a safe clay container, held by the man.\n\nSaving me from unethical activities.\n\nStill, his dandelion alternative is ok to convey the point.\n\nWhen I collide with Cholita like that, I gain her dark energy.\n\nAnd it lasts up to several days.\n\nWhat it seems to do, is give me more ability to fine tune which \"depth\" in the second attention my gaze is focused, and to learn what that depth \"feels like\" so that I no longer have to search for it.\n\nIf I want to return to viewing that location in the multiverse I only have to blow my breath gently into that memory of a specific feeling.\n\nThat single patch of the multiverse, which is actually just a specific mini-bundle of emanations which can be lit up by focusing your awareness on enough of them to trigger the right harmonics and summon that reality patch to be projected back to you, can be done by using the feeling of your breath.\n\nExcept, there's one MILLION such feelings.\n\nAnd you have to feel the right one.\n\nSo you could never teach people to try to use their breath, to adjust the horizontal position of their assemblage point, at a specific depth.\n\nEven though, Carol Tiggs tried to teach that in Sochi.\n\nPeople just complained about her.  Even seemed to like Cleargreen leaders better than Carol.\n\nShe wasn't rehashing the same old make believe \"warrior\" routine, and had introduced something too new for their tastes.\n\nAs she once joked, she'd been told not to tell stories at workshops anymore because it makes the women cry.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title":

Almost like you are inside a cave, and even though you can&amp;#39;t see anything, you can feel that your blackness is now &amp;quot;3D&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Green Line&amp;quot; depth into the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not much, but people start entire cults and religions over being able to perceive that using meditation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Sorcery, instead of moving the assemblage point just 8 inches down the back, as meditation does, you eventually move it a full 23 FEET.  I calculated it using ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;depth&amp;quot; available with simple closed eye meditation feels about like 10 feet. Coming from that 8 inch movement.  If you are meditating and suddenly the blackness &amp;quot;opens up&amp;quot;, and you can feel that it&amp;#39;s now a space,  if you were to estimate how large that black space is, meaning how far you could stand up and walk off into it, you might estimate 10 feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But out in the purple zone on the J curve, if you gaze out to figure out how far that 4th dimension of depth into the Nagual reaches, you would start to move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sitting up on pillows on the bed, you&amp;#39;d find that the bed and the pillows scrolled back and away from you, with you seemingly safe just hovering in the air at the same height, while everything else traveled back on it&amp;#39;s own.  With you heading out into outer space, but a space filled with new realities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/r1p0l2rweqvc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=890a95ff250498ff9fbd4384c076fe10771a8377\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/r1p0l2rweqvc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=890a95ff250498ff9fbd4384c076fe10771a8377&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, before you start drooling (and it is in fact this awesome to be in Silent Knowledge) forget it...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t get to enjoy it the way you&amp;#39;re imagining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Enjoying&amp;quot; things to people who live in the river of shit, means running around &amp;quot;sharing&amp;quot; your discovery with friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t even enjoy something, without others to run to and grab attention!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same as bad players who post in this subreddit, and anyone seasoned instantly knows they want attention.  Not magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a curse on us so horrible that we can&amp;#39;t even conceive of enjoying something just for the enrichment of our own awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We NEED that attention fix from others.  As someone posted today, we seek the dopamine high of &amp;quot;sharing&amp;quot; with others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To reach SK, you have to ditch that &amp;quot;poor baby me&amp;quot; self obsession.  Not everything has to be a thing you can sell in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even a hint of the merchant mind kills any possibility you can get to this level of exploration of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus scratch all religions and magical systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hopeless for them. All showbiz, profits and endorsements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If any of them stumbled on slightly better magic than the green zone has provided them, they&amp;#39;d waste it all on the idea of &amp;quot;proving it&amp;quot; to more people, so they can become famous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They kind of have to be stuck with mediocre magic, by the very nature of their systems.  Anything more will stop them from making more progress, by activating their book deal mind. If they rise above whatever endorsement seeking muck they are stuck in, they&amp;#39;ll only try to figure out how to lord it over others on that basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Putting aside any moral implications, they quite simply can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;see in the right direction and at the necessary depth&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even if they tried, their &amp;quot;depth&amp;quot; is limited to 10 feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no chance for them to shrink their tonal and travel nearly infinite distances in depth, due to the lack of an energy body forming around them.  That can&amp;#39;t even begin to happen until the assemblage point is moved at least 12 feet.  Not 8 inches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dub4lsdufqvc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e7554ddca448935e0e8cc0b4e22ec3c5400f5154\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/dub4lsdufqvc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e7554ddca448935e0e8cc0b4e22ec3c5400f5154&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To do the most spectacular things, you have to have your double with you. His eyes are the ones which can focus to anywhere in time and space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to a key point.  The reason that first picture shows a ghost in a park and a man looking at her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t get ChatGPT to draw what I wanted no matter what I told him. He just got more and more lost because he incorporated new ideas into the last failed picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But imagine that park is very full of bushes and people and activity, and the ghost girl is rather hard to see, off in the bushes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he looks away for even an instant, he might not find her spot again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because in fact, she isn&amp;#39;t located in a specific place in the park.  She&amp;#39;s absolutely located in the direction of specific bushes and the little clearing in the middle of them, but it&amp;#39;s also at a very specific &amp;quot;depth&amp;quot; into the Nagual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Into the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so even looking off to the left of her to see why people are cheering at their volleyball game in the park, will require him to adjust the &amp;quot;depth&amp;quot; he&amp;#39;s gazing at, into the multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The girl is at &amp;quot;Possibility 172,486&amp;quot;.  Located between those bushes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the volleyball game is at possibility #1,  in the ordinary blue line reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By having to refocus his depth to see if someone just spiked the ball at an opponent, he&amp;#39;s lost the location of #172,486 reality variation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when he looks back there&amp;#39;s no ghost child there anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, this is why it&amp;#39;s so horrible when beginners try to use someone who can move their assemblage point, as an experimental subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suggesting &amp;quot;why don&amp;#39;t you try this for me, and tell me what happens.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s close to manslaughter to ask someone to do that, because whatever they were currently exploring will be erased by injecting that person&amp;#39;s lazy greed into the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This insect nest picture is pretty bad, but imagine that we&amp;#39;re always reaching towards a specific combination of emanations we&amp;#39;ve discovered, in the dark sea.  Our darkroom practice stores the &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; of what&amp;#39;s happened all the times we practiced it before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;in depth&amp;quot;.  Your tensegrity pass summons a specific depth into alternate versions of your dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t do your ritual combination of movements in precisely the same order and same way, as last time,  while remembering your 2nd attention goal during that movement,  you may never find it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Afterall, we all get &amp;quot;intent gifts&amp;quot; from time to time and discover that even expecting that to happen again is enough to make it impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the same situation as when it happened the first time, even if all that changed was your expectation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our &amp;quot;depth into the nagual&amp;quot; is a beam of awareness we don&amp;#39;t normally use.  Some kind of &amp;quot;auxiliary shine&amp;quot; of our gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qnl4ctr8hqvc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=31a40b3f5b946b7a5c3b2647a4eefe702e5d53dc\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/qnl4ctr8hqvc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=31a40b3f5b946b7a5c3b2647a4eefe702e5d53dc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m certain that witches are better equipped to understand this.  Because they have to get involved in self-soothing from time to time. And they develop a ritual, so that they can &amp;quot;find&amp;quot; the little sparkle of good feeling which blossomed the last time they managed to soothe themselves.  They &amp;quot;look for&amp;quot; some specific sensation while laying in a nice warm bath surrounded by flowers and candles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or at least, Cholita does that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I collided with her 2 days ago, and this post is the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things got really weird as a result.  The power on our side of the street went out, I left my darkroom realizing Cholita would be worried, and found she&amp;#39;d placed little candles in a trail all through the house, leading out and into her work studio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She set up a path for me to follow, when I finally left my room.  But didn&amp;#39;t disturb me before then.  Since I was already in darkness, it took me a while to figure out we&amp;#39;d lost power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reluctantly I snuck in the direction she wanted,  worried she had herself thrown off the power switch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when I was almost to where the trail of glowing yellow candles ended I heard, &amp;quot;Daniel... Can you fix this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might be saying, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not so odd.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;re just not realizing what that looked like, with the entire block of our neighborhood blacked out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/p89mho7mbqvc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eee43f7d55dc54b1123c0aae842d10e6db3d841c\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/p89mho7mbqvc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=eee43f7d55dc54b1123c0aae842d10e6db3d841c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result was literally what you see in this badly made ChatGPT picture. I just couldn&amp;#39;t get him to draw what I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it conveys the point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are blowing the flower petals off a dandelion, you have to blow in a certain direction. But also aim for the &amp;quot;depth&amp;quot; of the dandelion flower. If you blow &amp;quot;past&amp;quot; it, it&amp;#39;ll just fall apart in an instant. If you blow too shallow, nothing will happen.  You have to &amp;quot;aim&amp;quot; for the center of that flower, if you want to watch the petals fall off a few at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started my picture request with a little campfire in a hole in a huge chunk of swiss cheese, asking ChatGPT to show that the man was blowing into the hole in the cheese. One of many, but he had identified one where a spark of awareness had created a little campfire surrounded by alien beings, and he was trying to blow the fire brighter so he could see their faces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But ChatGPT decided that lighting fires in swiss cheese is dangerous, so he extracted the fire into a safe clay container, held by the man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saving me from unethical activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, his dandelion alternative is ok to convey the point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I collide with Cholita like that, I gain her dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it lasts up to several days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What it seems to do, is give me more ability to fine tune which &amp;quot;depth&amp;quot; in the second attention my gaze is focused, and to learn what that depth &amp;quot;feels like&amp;quot; so that I no longer have to search for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I want to return to viewing that location in the multiverse I only have to blow my breath gently into that memory of a specific feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That single patch of the multiverse, which is actually just a specific mini-bundle of emanations which can be lit up by focusing your awareness on enough of them to trigger the right harmonics and summon that reality patch to be projected back to you, can be done by using the feeling of your breath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, there&amp;#39;s one MILLION such feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you have to feel the right one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you could never teach people to try to use their breath, to adjust the horizontal position of their assemblage point, at a specific depth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though, Carol Tiggs tried to teach that in Sochi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People just complained about her.  Even seemed to like Cleargreen leaders better than Carol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wasn&amp;#39;t rehashing the same old make believe &amp;quot;warrior&amp;quot; routine, and had introduced something too new for their tastes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As she once joked, she&amp;#39;d been told not to tell stories at workshops anymore because it makes the women cry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON

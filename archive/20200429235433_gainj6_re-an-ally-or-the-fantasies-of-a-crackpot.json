The way he portrayed allies was correct, in that you \"spin\" with them, which is to say they have a \"force\" of their own. However, this spinning is purely mental as far as I can tell, but like in a dream, what you feel and experience during your encounter with an ally will feel \"real\" and in some cases will have very real consequences.\n\n\\### When, Where, and How\n\nThere are many types of allies out there but what I came to realize is that allies don't approach you until you reach a point in your career as a sorcerer that you can handle the power they give you. One thing is clear is that they do heighten your awareness but do so to your personal aptitudes; so say you're a writer/author like Carlos was, your ability to write will be enhanced--which is why Carlos' works are so well composed and thorough and have a sense of clarity--otherwise they would be a mess that no editor would publish. Allies may have \"localities\" like humans do; you may have to travel to a certain place like DJ and Carlos did to find them. This may be because DJ said certain places have more power than others that attract allies and may be a conduit for power. Personally, I take a cocktail of pharmaceuticals daily, that I learned of during my time as a hunter after my symbolic death, so I don't have to travel to places of power to find allies.\n\n\\### The Test\n\nPersonally, I didn't realize I had an ally until months later--I just thought I was going mad. Thankfully I have a lifetime experience knowing what true madness is like from seeing it happen to my witch of a mother. The only way you can know for sure you haven't gone mad (with the power from an ally or just plan psychosis) is when you simply ask to stop spinning with your intent. But after do so, you'll certainly have \"artifacts\" you left behind, which might be notes, or in my case mathematical notes and papers. The true test, however, is that if you are still able to clearly understand your \"trophies\" once you stop spinning, then odds are you didn't enter heightened awareness, and thus didn't spin with an ally. Carlos stated in his works that he too was unable to make sense of his notes from DJ after leaving heightened awareness.\n\n\\### Precautionary Measures\n\nAs I mentioned, I take a strong pharmaceutical cocktail that #1 ensures I don't go mad on my adventures, #2 give me power to \\_feel\\_ abstract commands, and #3 to sustain the moods of a warrior 24/7 so I can enter the \\_gate to intent\\_. I've escaped certain death on multiple occasions because of these precautionary measures or \"controlled folly\" as Carlos would call them. For example, I felt a strong command, like a wave passing through me, before hopping in my car one night, and on the drive home my car engine exploded--had I not have been driving 30mph in the slow lane the whole way (because of the command I felt) I would be dead. My advice is don't seek allies out, period; they are dangerous as fuck. They will find you when you're ready, so long as you have the power (obtained through inner silence, etc) to spin or \"bond\" with them.\n\n\\### Take Away\n\nI'm not an expert on allies like dan is or others in this sub, so only they can say with authority what the nature of allies are and if they are \"intelligent\" beings like humans are or if they have \"agendas\" like humans have. I've never \\_seen\\_ an ally nor the ally I've encountered on several accounts, nor have I \\_heard\\_ an ally; this is because you don't use your normal senses when spinning with them. They have a way of directly allowing access to their knowledge and power that's hard to describe, other than what normal people call \"intuition\" but what I would call abstract commands. In the end, I think what you can take away from this post is that: in most cases allies find you, you don't find them (unless you're a vetted sorcerer such as DJ). However, this may not be feasible, as if practice dreaming, you're sure to encounter inorganic beings--but in my experience--the allies that found me not through dreaming as opposed to the inorganic beings I've found while dreaming, were much more benevolent and useful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.

In fact, I would say no other medication in my cocktail has such a unilateral affect, rather they work together to produce a desired mental state.

However, our sample pool will be pretty small, so if we can't obtain the required sample sizes, then no hypothesis tests should even be conducted--otherwise it's just cargo cult science at that point. However, we don't want to stifle civil or casual discussions here neither, we should be open minded but ruthless with the truth. Perhaps, we could have a `trial` flair or badge (whatever it's called, ha) for posts asking for volunteers to test a hypothesis they have?

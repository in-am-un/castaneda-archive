But I created it originally just in the course of another posts thread of comments.\n\nI'll copy the text from facebook, even though it's a recycled picture.\n\nIt's an \"upgrade\" to our understanding of what shapeshifting is.\n\nWe were a bit \"overly dramatic\" about defining what it can be.\n\n\\*\\*\\* From Facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen you learn sorcery (for real), it's a very long road.\n\nThe good news is, it doesn't \"take several lifetimes\".\n\nThat's the slogan for Buddhism and Hinduism, to explain why nothing is actually happening. Other than some simple (lame) meditation effects. They tell you to be patient, to keep the donations flowing.\n\nOf course, there's no reincarnation so don't think I'm endorsing that idea. We live several timelines at once. That's perhaps how Hindus got confused.\n\nSomeone got a glimpse of a \"cyclic being\" and thought it was in the past. So he wrote it up, to try to profit from the vision.\n\nThat \"past life\" being in the present wouldn't make any sense to them.\n\nBut sorcerers both get to see it, and switch timelines if they choose.\n\nSo sorcery is a very long road, but results beyond all other systems come to you almost immediately if you actually work to learn it. In some ways, it's really just about \"intending\" to learn it.\n\nBut the intent has to be honest.\n\nCarlos tried to teach us this point by asking one private class to \"Walk to San Diego\". It was 110 miles away.\n\nNo one would, but through that Carlos was teaching us about \"the cubic centimeter of chance\". Or maybe \"Offers from Infinity\".\n\nThat was one. We didn't do it, so we'll never know what would have happened.\n\nBut don't worry! Myself, I'm not a big fan of huge acts of dedication.\n\nPeople put on a show, and believe that's somehow the same as actually being able to do what they're claiming they are learning.\n\nSo put down the Daoist Monk robe...\n\nThat and other such big shows of dedication are too close to the same old shit to get you anywhere.\n\nIt's really just attention seeking to wear Monks garb.\n\nYou make actual progress by finding a little thread in the dirt, dusting it off to see the end of it, and then you slowly pull it up without breaking it.\n\nCarlos gave us that analogy. It's a metaphor for \"navigating\".\n\nThe thread comes up bit by bit and you keep following it to see what's at the other end.\n\nTHAT'S how you can learn sorcery when you're on your own as we are.\n\nTensegrity is like that thread.\n\nBut you have to see some \"results\" from it, which defy reason.\n\nOtherwise, you'll just turn it into crappy Yoga or Chi Gung.\n\nThose lead nowhere.\n\nJust to the same thing we call, \"Jogger's High\".\n\nOr to the same thing women can do in a warm bath, surrounded by candles and fragrant bouquets of flowers.\n\nThey drift into the green zone on that J curve.\n\nJust about anything can get you to that green zone. Prayer works too.\n\nThe REAL start of that useful \"thread\", stuck in the dirt waiting for you to uncover it, is shapeshifting.\n\nWhen you shapeshift, you've gotten beyond the self-soothing of closed eye meditation.\n\nDarkroom (Tensegrity in silence and darkness) inevitably leads to shapeshifting.\n\nIn its most simple form, the tensegrity movements can mutate until you are reaching too far out to be possible.\n\nOr leaning so far to the side you're practically horizontal in the air.\n\nYou can be doing tensegrity by the wall in your darkroom, and see a magical object materialize behind it.\n\nThe \"moving dreaming energy from back to front\" pass can cause that.\n\nDreaming energy tends to form \"things\".\n\nSo you see an alluring magical object behind the wall, and instinctively reach through to take it out.\n\nBreaking the laws of physics.\n\nThat also is shapeshifting.

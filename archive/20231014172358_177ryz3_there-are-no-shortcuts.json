I could hardly read the first twenty pages of his book.  I am surprised by so many fans of his books.  In his new book, he claims that Carlos introduced him to a group of old magicians in Mexico and he was accepted into this group of magicians.  These old sorcerers compete with each other in different groups, like a football team, and beat each other with the intention of killing each other to keep their attention on the path of Nawal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/177ryz3/there_are_no_shortcuts/k4yihgp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1697363683.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_177ryz3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k6lbv4f", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "hogtownd00m", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1698353852.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_177ryz3", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_15a5py", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Hi all, I hope this response does not come across as attempting to take a shortcut.

It's one of the rare times she giggles.\n\nAnd Larry wouldn't say that, because Armando wasn't in private classes.\n\nThey just picked his name out of all the old sustained action dialogues. Or from some other source. Not realizing, all of us knew each other well.\n\nI put out word to anyone who knew where Larry was to have him come talk to me so we could straighten this out.\n\nSo they (Eddy most likely) changed the lie a second time!\n\nNow, Armando was in a secret private class in Mexico, that I wouldn't know about.\n\nHow could we not know about a private class in Mexico?\n\nWith Carlos up here all the time?\n\nArmando is so clueless he doesn't realize what it was like being around Carlos.\n\nWe'd know about that going on for sure!

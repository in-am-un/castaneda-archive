You can do this. I did it last night.\n\nBut you'll have to get into the private sub to read how.

That's the negative of being on uncharted ground.\n\nIf someone else taught you to do it, you don't get nearly as excited when it works.  You expected that.\n\nBut when you find it  yourself, the book deal mind is sure to destroy it.\n\nIt's like finding an exotic candy store in the old section of town, which has every possible candy from the entire history of the modern age.\n\nAs you look at all of the different candy types, you're itching to find your friends and tell them all about the place.  In fact, you're so obsessed with thinking, \"They have that one??!!!???  Bob loves those!!!\" that you barely look at things for all the pondering you are doing about what Bob is going to say about your discovery.\n\nBut if Bob told you, you actually get a chance to examine the details without freaking out. In fact, the book deal mind, in that case, might cause you to examine the candy there in greater detail, looking for a \"micro book deal\" to bring back to Bob.  \n\nSure, he discovered it.  But did he know they had old fashioned nonpareils? \n\nSometimes a book deal is ok, even helpful.  As long as you don't freak out and start vomiting pea soup the way some do in here, when they feel \"dissed\".\n\nUnfortunately, if you freak out while doing 3D translocation the wind blows it all away.\n\nI mean literally.  I never expected anything like that. \n\nLondon Town turns into a mist and passes you by due to a convenient \"breeze\" that suddenly shows up, leaving your empty darkroom.\n\nWell... Not empty. If you can do this, you've likely got a phantom dark room going.\n\nIn my case, it blew away and I was back to the struggling antique store.  Not much on the shelves there.  I must have seen a place like that on the way to Banning back in the 60s.\n\nSide tip: The ability to do this, 3D translocation,  is one key to as many inorganic beings as you can manage.\n\nBecause it creates PRECISELY the type of energy they love best.\n\nImagine it. It's lucid dreaming attention, where you focus from object to object thus attracting them, but turbo charged.\n\nIt's like putting steak dinners all over the street at night, leading into the mountain area where the coyotes live.\n\nWe need to get more IOBs in here.

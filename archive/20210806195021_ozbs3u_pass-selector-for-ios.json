over your product category, you actually have to make an effort to sell stuff like that.\n\nMy Chinese business partner used to say, \"You don't want to be the first to sell a new idea.  You want to be 2nd. The sequel always makes more than the original.\"\n\nEven if it's a great idea, you won't sell enough to make it worthwhile without some outside free publicity.\n\nDoesn't matter if the price is $0.  Same principle applies.\n\nI thought I saw an ad on the cleargreen web page.\n\nOtherwise, it could very well be this place gives the most exposure.\n\nSad if that's true...\n\nYour problem might be, whoever would find your ap valuable would be someone who could not move their assemblage point.    So they're looking for gadgets, tricks, more books by phony sorcerers, to avoid doing the harder work.\n\nLearning to get silent.\n\nThey'll spend their entire life doing that,  avoiding actual work beyond doing exercises, and never learn any real sorcery.\n\nIt's what happened so far!  No one learned to get silent and move their assemblage point.\n\nIf there's a way to add advice on how to do that in the ap, it would be an even better learning aide.\n\nAlthough it should be as simple as reminding them don Juan said that was the most important thing.\n\nIf it were my ap, I'd teach them silence in stages.\n\nStage 1: determine how long you can get silent, in order to prove you have identified the internal dialogue.  Find a pass that has only one real movement, and has a \"pause\" in the movement.  Like, poking your fingers through a membrane.  Instruct them  to freeze there, and determine how long they can go with a word.  After they get a word in their mind, \"unfreeze\", finish the movement, take a nice deep breath, and try it again to see if you can go longer.\n\nNote: If they claim they went more than 10 seconds, they're hopeless.  Just tell them so.  Lack of honesty makes learning sorcery impossible.  But you could phrase that better.  Tell them 1 in 10,000 has an \"alternate\" internal dialogue, and the ap is not designed to help with that.\n\nStage 2:  Find a repeatable pass, like Zuleica's pass, to use as a \"counter\".  How many times can they do that pass,  without a single word in their mind?  \n\nEnter the count using up and down arrows, and keep track of it.  When they make it to 10 passes with absolutely no words in their mind, move to stage 3.\n\nNote that using the up arrow is important, to let them avoid having to count in their mind.  If they count anyway, that's ok. It'll be like \"cheating\" and thinking a word, but not having to count it as failure. You could actually break that into 2 stages if it was easy.  First count it out loud.  Second use up arrow only.\n\nStage 3: Try to be silent during an entire long form.  Keep in mind, this might seem like stage 2 again, but it's not!  Carlos started with short forms, thus stage 2.  Then he saw it wasn't working well, and created the long forms, explaining that trying to remember the moves, would help us to learn silence.\n\nBy doing that, you'll have hooked your ap's \"intent\" to the most important teaching decision Carlos made during the workshop period.\n\nIt might be possible to hook the ap to more *intent*, and then you can \"advertise it\" as containing magic in the very ap.\n\nAnd it would be true!\n\nKeep track of their \"silence stats\", and insist they daily increase it.  Remind them that you can't learn sorcery by movements alone after each pass they call up.\n\nNag them when it boots, if they haven't been increasing their silence stats.\n\nMaybe bring up a don Juan quote about that to prove the ap isn't wrong about the need to do that.\n\nCleargreen's web page seems to disagree with my assessment that silence needs plenty of nagging to motivate it,  giving Tensegrity full credit for silence.\n\nBut look how that's worked out for them.\n\nOn the other hand, speaking as someone who sells stuff, it's really annoying when you finish something and all anyone can say is, \"it would be cooler if you added this other thing...\"\n\nDoesn't get you any closer to having people buy the ap.\n\nI'd go for the \"This ap contains magic\" bit!\n\nJust make sure it really does.\n\nIn those \"stages\", you could have #99 = capture an inorganic being using Tensegrity.\n\nThat's how I got mine!  All of them.\n\nI suppose you could even select specific tensegrity moves which can open a portal to a dreaming world, allowing you to enter (sometimes).\n\nAdvanced stages?", "edited": 1629042187.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h91eugy", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, speaking as someone who sells stuff, unless the general news media has gone bonkers over your product category, you actually have to make an effort to sell stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Chinese business partner used to say, &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t want to be the first to sell a new idea.

The sequel always makes more than the original.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if it&amp;#39;s a great idea, you won&amp;#39;t sell enough to make it worthwhile without some outside free publicity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t matter if the price is $0.  Same principle applies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought I saw an ad on the cleargreen web page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, it could very well be this place gives the most exposure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sad if that&amp;#39;s true...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your problem might be, whoever would find your ap valuable would be someone who could not move their assemblage point.    So they&amp;#39;re looking for gadgets, tricks, more books by phony sorcerers, to avoid doing the harder work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learning to get silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll spend their entire life doing that,  avoiding actual work beyond doing exercises, and never learn any real sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s what happened so far!  No one learned to get silent and move their assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s a way to add advice on how to do that in the ap, it would be an even better learning aide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although it should be as simple as reminding them don Juan said that was the most important thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it were my ap, I&amp;#39;d teach them silence in stages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stage 1: determine how long you can get silent, in order to prove you have identified the internal dialogue.  Find a pass that has only one real movement, and has a &amp;quot;pause&amp;quot; in the movement.  Like, poking your fingers through a membrane.  Instruct them  to freeze there, and determine how long they can go with a word.  After they get a word in their mind, &amp;quot;unfreeze&amp;quot;, finish the movement, take a nice deep breath, and try it again to see if you can go longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: If they claim they went more than 10 seconds, they&amp;#39;re hopeless.  Just tell them so.  Lack of honesty makes learning sorcery impossible.  But you could phrase that better.  Tell them 1 in 10,000 has an &amp;quot;alternate&amp;quot; internal dialogue, and the ap is not designed to help with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stage 2:  Find a repeatable pass, like Zuleica&amp;#39;s pass, to use as a &amp;quot;counter&amp;quot;.  How many times can they do that pass,  without a single word in their mind?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enter the count using up and down arrows, and keep track of it.  When they make it to 10 passes with absolutely no words in their mind, move to stage 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that using the up arrow is important, to let them avoid having to count in their mind.  If they count anyway, that&amp;#39;s ok. It&amp;#39;ll be like &amp;quot;cheating&amp;quot; and thinking a word, but not having to count it as failure. You could actually break that into 2 stages if it was easy.  First count it out loud.  Second use up arrow only.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stage 3: Try to be silent during an entire long form.  Keep in mind, this might seem like stage 2 again, but it&amp;#39;s not!  Carlos started with short forms, thus stage 2.  Then he saw it wasn&amp;#39;t working well, and created the long forms, explaining that trying to remember the moves, would help us to learn silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By doing that, you&amp;#39;ll have hooked your ap&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; to the most important teaching decision Carlos made during the workshop period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might be possible to hook the ap to more &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, and then you can &amp;quot;advertise it&amp;quot; as containing magic in the very ap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it would be true!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep track of their &amp;quot;silence stats&amp;quot;, and insist they daily increase it.  Remind them that you can&amp;#39;t learn sorcery by movements alone after each pass they call up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nag them when it boots, if they haven&amp;#39;t been increasing their silence stats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe bring up a don Juan quote about that to prove the ap isn&amp;#39;t wrong about the need to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cleargreen&amp;#39;s web page seems to disagree with my assessment that silence needs plenty of nagging to motivate it,  giving Tensegrity full credit for silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But look how that&amp;#39;s worked out for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, speaking as someone who sells stuff, it&amp;#39;s really annoying when you finish something and all anyone can say is, &amp;quot;it would be cooler if you added this other thing...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t get you any closer to having people buy the ap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d go for the &amp;quot;This ap contains magic&amp;quot; bit!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just make sure it really does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In those &amp;quot;stages&amp;quot;, you could have #99 = capture an inorganic being using Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how I got mine!  All of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could even select specific tensegrity moves which can open a portal to a dreaming world, allowing you to enter (sometimes).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced stages?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_ozbs3u", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ozbs3u/pass_selector_for_ios/h91eugy/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1629040551.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1629040551.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h8zzcty", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Retel_Tulio", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h7zckr0", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_9gihmanb", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "It is set up that way.

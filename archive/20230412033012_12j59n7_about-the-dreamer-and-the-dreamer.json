As Carlos described if you look for that type of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old seers discovered they liked how the passes made them feel, deep in dreaming.  Specific feelings for each!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#39;re sure to misunderstand that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, they liked to shapeshift into a werejaguar, and chase innocent creatures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or stretch themselves up twice as high using tensegrity moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We keep stretching into the non-human unknown, but they just bent back to get more of the human unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s still the same basic &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; discovered by the old seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;So there is only one way to magic for us, is intensive Tensegrity practice in a dark room&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No ABSOLUTELY NOT!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just what Little Smoke gave me to use here.  I was already playing with puff balls in full on room lighting, once the allies of Carlos drove me mad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Little Smoke refined it into &amp;quot;darkroom practice&amp;quot; to make it easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then ditched me for younger people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the actual techniques from the books will work, when people really do them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just never really do, do them...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so far we have no &amp;quot;trail blazers&amp;quot; in here, who stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except the women with their womb dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still I&amp;#39;d love to see a skilled gazer!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And especially I&amp;#39;d love to see an expert on magic during recap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is NOT a new topic!  The recapitulation in the books lead to amazing magic!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People just ignored that, and lie about doing recap for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t teleport eventually, you didn&amp;#39;t do recap right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So please never imply I told everyone this is &amp;quot;the only path&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what bad players do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I WILL say, hard work is the only path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very hard work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe somewhere Carlos or don Juan said you have to work like a dog, and then work even harder the next time.  You never get to work &amp;quot;less hard&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like lifting heavy weights at the gym!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t reach 150 on the bench press, and then &amp;quot;let up&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to lift even heavier weights each time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for jogging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t do a 12 minute mile, and then &amp;quot;let up&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not if you want to be doing marathons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_12j59n7", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/12j59n7/about_the_dreamer_and_the_dreamer/jfyw2kf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1681310476.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1681310476.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jfypd2i", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jfymqyj", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "Thank you for such a detailed explanation.

I wrote an idea that came to my mind when I was thinking about the double and the ways in which it can be brought closer/attracted to the physical body (in addition to Tensegrity). This thought seemed interesting to me, as it fits the description of the process of bringing awareness into our reality, just as one can bring it through a dream. That is, we are talking about awareness in real life, starting from the principle of awareness in a dream. Since, in fact, these are two dreams.\n\nBut this is a distraction from the specific topic of the practice of the dark room and their results, so I apologize, although the principle itself includes this practice, since by practicing tensegrity and searching for colors we become aware in our world. Just as if we were bringing irrationality into our lives by holding it as long as possible and not giving it explanations (disabling critical thinking/internal dialogue).\n\nEdited: By irrationality, I mean phenomena that break out of the usual framework. Spots in the dark, various manifestations of second attention, or for example any illusions that can be caused without including critical thinking. I want to emphasize that I share these two concepts, the manifestation of second attention and illusions. They are not equal, it goes without saying, but both lead to the same thing if you manage to disable internal dialogue or critical thinking for a while. This is just an assumption, not the truth.

I wrote an idea that came to my mind when I was thinking about the double and the ways in which it can be brought closer/attracted to the physical body (in addition to Tensegrity). This thought seemed interesting to me, as it fits the description of the process of bringing awareness into our reality, just as one can bring it through a dream. That is, we are talking about awareness in real life, starting from the principle of awareness in a dream. Since, in fact, these are two dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this is a distraction from the specific topic of the practice of the dark room and their results, so I apologize, although the principle itself includes this practice, since by practicing tensegrity and searching for colors we become aware in our world. Just as if we were bringing irrationality into our lives by holding it as long as possible and not giving it explanations (disabling critical thinking/internal dialogue).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: By irrationality, I mean phenomena that break out of the usual framework. Spots in the dark, various manifestations of second attention, or for example any illusions that can be caused without including critical thinking.

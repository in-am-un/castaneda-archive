You could simply laugh and ask them, \"Who's your tailor???\"\n\nThat would end it.\n\nBut if you run for your life, you can probably get away.\n\nLittle Smoke and Devil's weed chased me across several hotel hallways in Asia.\n\nI only lost them when I arrived at a friends doorway, hoping he could see them too.\n\nNaturally when he let me in and I turned around, they weren't there.\n\nBut the first time I had to actually wrestle one, my path was blocked.\n\nI couldn't run away.  I was pressed against a bed, and it kept coming.\n\nNot fast!  They love to draw it out, and get every bit of energy.\n\nAs he got closer and closer I had to bend back at the waist, leaning back on the bed so fa, it actually hurt.\n\nHis jet black hands reached in to push me back further, presumably to break me in half.\n\nI had no choice but to push back.  I was facing him,  pushing with my palms on his chest, and he was doing the same.\n\nIt was impossible!   The force of his push was infinite.  The only thing that didn't cause me to die instantly was, he moved so slowly it would have taken 20 seconds to break my back.\n\nI pushed back anyway, despite it being impossible.\n\nThat changed the situation. I wasn't as afraid. I was now sort of trying to figure out if there was another way to deal with it.  I had to keep pushing as hard as I could, but maybe I could rotate slightly, and get him to fall off the left side.\n\nThe instant my thinking changed, his push became weaker.\n\nSuddenly I could resist him.  I kept pushing, and he backed off.  Just stood there, facing me.\n\nI'd \"burned up\" IOBs in dreaming before, so I tried that technique.\n\nI pointed my finger at him and shouted, \"Change!!!!  Change!!!!\"\n\nI stared at his \"shirt\", very closely.  If I had been able to find a \"button\" on his jet black clothes, I would have focused on that.  To look at even the smallest detail, to see if it changed in any way.\n\nIt's like trying to read text in a dream. No way it can remain the same!\n\nHis \"details\" began to change, he started to convulse, folded in on himself and fell to the floor, leaving only a pile of clothes.\n\nWhite clothes!  He was jet black.\n\nMoral of the story: Wrestling an ally is really just wrestling your feelings about it.\n\nI don't believe I had to wrestle another one until \"Fancy\".  But my life is like a Harry Potter movie.  Too much magic to remember.  If I didn't make pictures to post in here, I'd forget most of it.\n\nFancy was a replacement for \"Fairy\", who went to live with Juann.  From this subreddit.\n\nI had to \"wrestle\" Fancy over and over.\n\nShe wasn't \"tame\", like Little Smoke and Devil's Weed.\n\nEven though devil's Weed is a total asshole, he's been around the lineage what must be hundreds of years, just like Little Smoke.\n\nBoth are unique inorganic beings, very close to human beings. They live at the center of the universe.\n\nThey really do!   Traveling that far only takes 20 seconds once you understand how to do it.\n\nI've had to wrestle Fancy each time she decides to capture me. 4-6 times perhaps?\n\nOnce she dropped a \"cage\" on top of me.  Flew above me, very pretty to see, sort of like she was saying, \"Hey stupid human!  Look at the pretty cage!!!\"\n\nAnd just dropped it down on me.  It had only been 2 inches wide, until it fell and expanded to what must have been 3 feet square.\n\nI was encased in an iron bar cage, like you might put a gorilla in.\n\nI panicked for an instant, and then decided it was actually quite interesting.  I checked to see how the bars were attached to the frame.\n\nBolts or rivets?\n\nThe cage vanished.\n\nNow it's been a  long time but as I recall, Fancy rewarded me by dropping a big cardboard box right on my bed.\n\nI actually felt the bed bounce.\n\nThen she leaned out from being it, and gave me what looked like a clumsy lap dance.  With the start of a strip tease, but she didn't go very far with that.\n\nI \"changed my feelings\", and she did too.\n\nThey like to interact.  I'm not sure they care how, as long as it's intense.\n\nSo anything you do to stop them from attacking, which \"changes the mood\" counts as wrestling them.\n\nEventually Fancy took me to her world, as all IOBs are willing to do.\n\nThat's how you get them to teach  you, dreaming Emissary style.\n\nAnd they do!!!  They really do!\n\nYou can't even mention that over in the Dzogchen places.  For instance, you can't ask them, \"Do your demons teach you witchcraft?\"\n\nThey'll cross themselves, like you were a vampire.\n\nSo anyone thinking Buddhism is powerful or cool, think again.\n\nIt's just more greedy bad player nonsense, with 1% real magic from the past.\n\nSo Fancy took me to her world, and I was expecting a cave, or dirt tunnel.\n\nLittle Smoke's tunnels are just normal looking dirt. Carol Tiggs pushed me into one (and another person too apparently).\n\nI was surprised to see her cave was made of ice.\n\nBut smooth ice.  Like methane ice.\n\nThere were no other beings there.\n\nLittle Smoke's cave is FULL of inorganic beings. The first time you see it, you'll gasp and try to run.\n\nBut then you'll notice, they run too.\n\nAnd so you stop, and it's sort of like Wizard of Oz, where the munchkins hide, but then slowly come out.\n\nIn fact, I believe I even saw one dressed like a fat baker.  Looked a bit like the mayor of munchkin town.\n\nFancy was all alone except for \"Bob\", her companion.\n\nIOBs seem to like to travel in 2s, with one dominate, and the other mostly inactive.\n\nI felt sorry for Fancy.  I got the impression her world was dying.\n\nWhile looking around her cave I saw a brand new, galvanized steel bolt. Laying on the ice floor, right in front of my feet.\n\nAbout 3/4 inch in diameter, so it was a hefty bolt.  Perhaps 4 inches long.\n\nI reached down to pick it up, but then realized I had just reached, in my physical body, right through the mattress I was sitting on.\n\nI felt the wooden floor to the side of the bolt, to make sure.\n\nYep.  I was still my bedroom. But how on earth did I reach through the bed?\n\nThat caused me to hesitate, and then I remembered.\n\nIf you pick up anything in the IOB world, you can get trapped.\n\nSo I ignored the bolt.\n\nI'd just wrestled Fancy.\n\nShe tried the bolt trick again a month or two later, this time making it too attractive to resist.\n\nBut I did.\n\nSo she never tried that again.\n\nA bolt might seem silly, but \"hardware\" was an obsession of mine as a small child. I liked to build machines, and the only way to get parts was by wandering around streets and parking lots, looking for discarded things.\n\nEven 60 years later, I couldn't resist a brand new bolt!\n\nThey seem to try bad things twice, like the bolt,  with slight modifications.  Maybe they think they didn't get it right the first time, and do their best to change it a bit.\n\nAnd when it doesn't work, they give up on that idea.", "edited": 1631049369.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hbz8ubs", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wonderful topic!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Castaneda community is too new to the real thing, to have any examples other than those in the books, and my own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my take on it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time you wrestle one, you&amp;#39;ll be forced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re in front of you, won&amp;#39;t go away, trying to scare you with a horrible form, perhaps even something so alien you can&amp;#39;t describe the sheer terror you feel as a result of it&amp;#39;s appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something even worse than &amp;quot;demon&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re so scared, the inorganic being just cannot resist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wants to get closer, to suck up the fright energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you essentially &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; it towards you with your own fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;re too new at it, to realize that.

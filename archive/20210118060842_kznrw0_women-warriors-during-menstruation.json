Too bad. There is nothing that anyone can do about it. It is your fate to be a man. Women are better than men in that sense. They don\u2019t have to jump into an abyss. Women have their own ways. They have their own abyss. Women menstruate. The Nagual told me that that was the door for them. During their period they become something else. I know that that was the time when he taught my girls. It was too late for me; I\u2019m too old so I really don\u2019t know what that door looks like. But the Nagual insisted that the girls pay attention to everything that happens to them during that time. He would take them during those days into the mountains and stay with them there until they would see the crack between the worlds.\n\u201cThe Nagual, since he had no qualms or fear about doing anything, pushed them without mercy so they could find out for themselves that there is a crack in women, a crack that they disguise very well. During their period, no matter how well made the disguise is, it falls away and women are bare. The Nagual pushed my girls until they were halfdead to open that crack. They did it. He made them do it, but it took them years.\u201d\n\nFrom chapter 3, \u201cLa Gorda:\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nagual told me and the little sisters that during our menstrual periods dreaming becomes power. I get a little crazy for one thing. I become more daring. And like the Nagual showed us, a crack opens in front of us during those days. You\u2019re not a woman so it can\u2019t make any sense to you, but two days before her period a woman can open that crack and step through it into another world.\u201d\n\nWith her left hand she followed the contour of an invisible line that seemed to run vertically in front of her at arm\u2019s length.\n\n\u201cDuring that time a woman, if she wants to, can let go of the images of the world,\u201d la Gorda went on. \u201cThat\u2019s the crack between the worlds, and as the Nagual said, it is right in front of all of us women.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason the Nagual believes women are better sorcerers than men is because they always have the crack in front of them, while a man has to make it.\n\u201cWell, it was during my periods that I learned in dreaming to fly with the lines of the world. I learned to make sparks with my body to entice the lines and then I learned to grab them. And that\u2019s all I have learned in dreaming so far.\u201d\n\n\nFrom chapter 5, \u201cThe Art of Dreaming:\u201d\n\n\u201cWe hold the images of the world with our attention. A male sorcerer is very difficult to train because his attention is always closed, focused on something. A female, on the other hand, is always open because most of the time she is not focusing her attention on anything. Especially during her menstrual period. The Nagual told me and then showed me that during that time I could actually let my attention go from the images of the world. If I don\u2019t focus my attention on the world, the world collapses.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is that done, Gorda?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. When a woman menstruates she cannot focus her attention. That\u2019s the crack the Nagual told me about. Instead of fighting to focus, a woman should let go of the images, by gazing fixedly at distant hills, or by gazing at water, like a river, or by gazing at the clouds.\n\n\u201cIf you gaze with your eyes open, you get dizzy and the eyes get tired, but if you halfclose them and blink a lot and move them from mountain to mountain, or from cloud to cloud, you can look for hours, or days if necessary.\n\n\u201cThe Nagual used to make us sit by the door and gaze at those round hills on the other side of the valley.

But there were slight variations between them, and that conveyed information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were absolutely stable, as long as I held a certain level of silence.  I could even stare at them, and they didn&amp;#39;t change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out if they were alive, or inanimate.  Except that, I was past thoughts.  So it wasn&amp;#39;t a thought, just a feeling that they could be either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I gazed at them closely, they held my internal dialogue absolutely off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tested it. When I wasn&amp;#39;t fully focused on them, my assemblage point started to move away from that point, and back to ordinary heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the right and left of the objects, windows to other places materialized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I  &amp;quot;knew&amp;quot; what was in there, without turning my head.  And that they were &amp;quot;offers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose, since I went looking for my dreaming double, I was being presented portals to explore with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;#39;t want to move because I was afraid I&amp;#39;d lose that state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept almost falling asleep, despite being absolutely alert.  I&amp;#39;d start to tilt and fall over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to slap myself a few times, to keep from falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 20 minutes of gazing like that, I was worn out.  Tired in some odd way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had to lay down and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_kznrw0", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/kznrw0/women_warriors_during_menstruation/gjvnvuv/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1611094426.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1611094426.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gjvkb4w", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gjuedoh", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;Anyway, that paled in comparison to what happened later\n\n?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gjvkb4w", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that paled in comparison to what happened later&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_kznrw0", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/kznrw0/women_warriors_during_menstruation/gjvkb4w/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1611092785.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1611092785.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gjuedoh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gjst1hi", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Yea, I managed to summon that vagina last night!\n\nI was obsessed with trying to reproduce the \"how\" Fancy had showed me, and then later when I got further on the J curve, I thought maybe all I need to do is look for it.\n\nIt worked!\n\nExcept when I pulled the 2 sides apart to look in, I couldn't comprehend it.\n\nIt was supposed to be a passage to the IOB realm.\n\nAnyway, that paled in comparison to what happened later, so it's probably not worth much more than a Silvio Manuel dirty joke.\n\nAs for reproducing things, there are 100,000 things you can do in the darkroom, and ten times more if you wanted to search for them.\n\nReproducing one of them is impractical.\n\nMore useful is to just do as many as you can, when they are offered, so that you learn the skills.

Fancy's very complicated tensegrity pass combination has some scheduled, \"play time\".  And intercepting dreams is a specialty you can lose, if you don't use it once in a while.\n\nI'm more interested in sharing a dream with Cholita, to find out what she thought of that \"new\" Taisha Book.  But she was nowhere to be found.  Except for earlier in the night when she staged a scene, so I could catch a short glimpse of her and see that she's doing fine.\n\nSince I haven't been doing dream intercepting for a while, I got a chance to \"feel it\".\n\nIt is in fact a very specific sensation, to allow a dream to bloom all by itself.\n\nYou have to let go. Give up.   Forget to control everything.\n\nYou catch a flaw in the room, in the purple fog.  Or on a puff of color, but puffy color is a little tricky because the dream can merge  with the puff, and become isolated.\n\nYou want the dream to materialize at normal human height, above the floor.  That's so you can \"walk in\", but also because our own intent knows more about that arrangement.\n\nFor example, you can materialize the dream into a soap bubble, floating in front of you.\n\nBut it's such a cold and alien place.  A dream that forms on the floor, at normal height, is much more \"cozy\".\n\nOur sustained action foe recently tried to take this subreddit down.  One idea he had was to re-obsess it with Lucid dreaming.\n\nLucid dreaming is what prevented people from sharing dreams reliably.  That nonsense has been going on over there, in lucid dreaming discussion groups,  for 30 years.  And they still haven't figured it out.\n\nThat's easy to explain!  YOU'RE BOTH ASLEEP YOU IDIOT!\n\nIt's like having 2 stoned and drunken people stumble around a park in the dark, looking for something, but no one told them what to look for.    So in the morning they make it up.\n\nIf at least one person is awake, you know you have a little sobriety going on. And to add sobriety to the one asleep, you only have to grab them.\n\nIf you grab Cholita however, be prepared for the chase of your life.\n\nLast time I tried that, I had to destroy a small village in Mexico to find her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How to Intercept Dreams: Instagram version",

You think **I'm** the one obsessed with sex?????!!!\"\n\nAnd she then forbid me to touch her dreaming double.\n\nBut I told her, it's not my fault if you come into my bedroom.\n\nAnd that night I wanted to see her closer, to find out if the clothes her dreaming double was wearing were one's I'd bought her.\n\nCholita has endless clothes, and no hope of me recognizing anything unless I was with her when it was purchased.\n\nThat would be \"proof\" of sorts.  If I could find a detail on the clothes, then see if it was true.  Like the label.\n\nCholita saw me from the corner of her eye. \n\nShe was pushing objects around on a table that materialized in front of her, looking down.\n\nBut I saw her frown.  She sensed me.\n\nShe started to walk away, right through the bedroom wall.\n\nI chased her a bit, but since i wasn't allowed to grab her the way Emilito did, she got away.\n\nShe was so fast!

I had my first woman show up on social media, who was claiming to have \"power\".\n\nMaybe she's just a witch, but over in the advanced subreddit we had a discussion about Cleargreen's advanced technique of having \"power\".\n\nIt wasn't pleasant to hear someone repeating that Man of Knowledge delusion, as if that were our goal.\n\nSeers don't care about \"power\"!  That's for those who CAN'T *see*.\n\nHow to make sure you don't pretend the results, probably so that you can get out of doing hard work?  By telling yourself you are working hard, when in fact you are only pretending to be working?\n\nFollow the instructions Carlos gave us!\n\nOutdoors, look for a purple smear in the sky to form, with a pomegranate dot on it, which spits out text.\n\nNaturally you won't be able to do that, because it requires a sustained period of silence perhaps 30 minutes long if you're mildly skilled at removing the internal dialogue.\n\nOr, look for visible \"weirdness\".\n\nAvoid a \"sensation\" or \"feeling\". Because those are precisely what people pretend.  Insist on visible results whenever possible.\n\nOr you'll end up like most of our community.\n\nAnd so if you went around on Facebook looking for old Castaneda fans, you'd find many who claim \"I can see\".  Or \"I learned to remove my internal dialogue.\"\n\nThey often have something else going on, like they're a \"Tai Chi Instructor\".\n\nWho can see??!??\n\nThey simply got away with pretending that so long, and don't actually believe any magic comes from this stuff, that they happily go around thinking no one can catch them red handed lying.\n\nAnd in our community, no one dared call them out.  Because they weren't sure if that's actually how things are.\n\nLame magic like all the other systems have.\n\nNaturally darkroom leads to what you suggest.\n\nThe craziness that happens at advanced stages during darkroom, happens all day long.\n\nIn full sunlight, with your eyes open.\n\nYou just have to get used to things darting past you, little smoke pillars walking down the street, or faces materializing in the sky.\n\nI ignore them. It's not my \"thing\".\n\nOnce in a while I'll talk to one though. If it's particularly well formed.\n\nWhich isn't so odd.\n\nCarlos told Amy to get a job as a maid in a hotel, and while she was working, she was to talk to everything.\n\nHer broom even.\n\nThat's a \"relationship to intent\".\n\nIf you play with the environment, it gives *intent* a chance to play back.\n\nSo maybe include noticing when leaves blow on the ground in an unusual way, which seems to be reacting to you noticing them.\n\nOr insects circle around you for no obvious reason.\n\nOr birds fly in odd ways that they obviously would not, if you weren't there.\n\nSkunk attacks is on my list, but that's from Cholita.", "edited": 1706221447.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kjkjmdv", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the problem is, this is dangerously close to the kind of pretending all other systems do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worry it will &amp;quot;stink&amp;quot; as much as Zen &amp;quot;mindfulness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos once made fun of some Buddhist guy at UCLA who walked around all day thinking he was doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos saw him walk right into a tree!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have super hearing, super sight, super smell, and super feeling of the wind and the temperature,  and the environment around you, you aren&amp;#39;t being silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If walking along a fairly deserted road, you should be aware of all cars coming in your direction, even so far back no one else would have noticed.

I had my first woman show up on social media, who was claiming to have &amp;quot;power&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe she&amp;#39;s just a witch, but over in the advanced subreddit we had a discussion about Cleargreen&amp;#39;s advanced technique of having &amp;quot;power&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t pleasant to hear someone repeating that Man of Knowledge delusion, as if that were our goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seers don&amp;#39;t care about &amp;quot;power&amp;quot;!  That&amp;#39;s for those who CAN&amp;#39;T &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to make sure you don&amp;#39;t pretend the results, probably so that you can get out of doing hard work?  By telling yourself you are working hard, when in fact you are only pretending to be working?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Follow the instructions Carlos gave us!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outdoors, look for a purple smear in the sky to form, with a pomegranate dot on it, which spits out text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally you won&amp;#39;t be able to do that, because it requires a sustained period of silence perhaps 30 minutes long if you&amp;#39;re mildly skilled at removing the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, look for visible &amp;quot;weirdness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Avoid a &amp;quot;sensation&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot;. Because those are precisely what people pretend.  Insist on visible results whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you&amp;#39;ll end up like most of our community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so if you went around on Facebook looking for old Castaneda fans, you&amp;#39;d find many who claim &amp;quot;I can see&amp;quot;.  Or &amp;quot;I learned to remove my internal dialogue.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They often have something else going on, like they&amp;#39;re a &amp;quot;Tai Chi Instructor&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who can see??!??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They simply got away with pretending that so long, and don&amp;#39;t actually believe any magic comes from this stuff, that they happily go around thinking no one can catch them red handed lying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in our community, no one dared call them out.  Because they weren&amp;#39;t sure if that&amp;#39;s actually how things are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lame magic like all the other systems have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally darkroom leads to what you suggest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The craziness that happens at advanced stages during darkroom, happens all day long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In full sunlight, with your eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just have to get used to things darting past you, little smoke pillars walking down the street, or faces materializing in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ignore them. It&amp;#39;s not my &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once in a while I&amp;#39;ll talk to one though. If it&amp;#39;s particularly well formed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which isn&amp;#39;t so odd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos told Amy to get a job as a maid in a hotel, and while she was working, she was to talk to everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her broom even.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;relationship to intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you play with the environment, it gives &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; a chance to play back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe include noticing when leaves blow on the ground in an unusual way, which seems to be reacting to you noticing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or insects circle around you for no obvious reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or birds fly in odd ways that they obviously would not, if you weren&amp;#39;t there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skunk attacks is on my list, but that&amp;#39;s from Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/19fi7wa/2nd_attention/kjkjmdv/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1706221235.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_19fi7wa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kjmekey", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "rob_242", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1706249208.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_19fi7wa", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_9hdwb3mm", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I think that's the whole plan, bringing the SA into FA, and merging them.

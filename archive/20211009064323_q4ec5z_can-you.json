I gave him the actual history of what Carlos found with don Juan, but there's no doubt it will be completely ignored, except by some lurkers who will come here without making a fuss.\n\nThe result was a \"bonanza\" of magic that night.  New stuff I didn't know  yet.\n\nIntent does reward effort, even if it doesn't seem to be effort to directly learn sorcery.\n\nAs an example, Lily pointed out Techno's efforts gathering old magazine interviews that reference Carlos, to make them available.\n\nShe said that counts as intense effort to, and gets rewarded equally by intent.\n\nI believe I actually saw Lily and Fancy fly by together.

And impossible for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So between those, you could figure that jumping grooves is an act of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, more than sorcery power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still that won&amp;#39;t do you any good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not knowing what the illness is, I&amp;#39;d say your best bet is to work so hard to learn sorcery (in here where it&amp;#39;s real), that intent notices your situation and decides to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, get intent to heal you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure healing by prayer, if it actually worked, would be summoning intent also.  Same principle, except the intent of ordinary people praying is pretty mixed up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to the shamanism subreddit on an urge, and learned so much it&amp;#39;s impossible to even explain it.  One thing I discovered (with the help of my inorganic being &amp;quot;Lily&amp;quot;) is that &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; helps you for any effort along your path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t analyze or rate the value of  your actions.  Hard work along your intended path, gets helped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that help included me having to battle with endless bad men over there, who didn&amp;#39;t want to face the fact that all of their shamanism is pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even got a &amp;quot;genuine Yaqui&amp;quot; repeat the same old story about how Carlos was a fraud, as if it made any sense.  I gave him the actual history of what Carlos found with don Juan, but there&amp;#39;s no doubt it will be completely ignored, except by some lurkers who will come here without making a fuss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result was a &amp;quot;bonanza&amp;quot; of magic that night.  New stuff I didn&amp;#39;t know  yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent does reward effort, even if it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be effort to directly learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an example, Lily pointed out Techno&amp;#39;s efforts gathering old magazine interviews that reference Carlos, to make them available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said that counts as intense effort to, and gets rewarded equally by intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe I actually saw Lily and Fancy fly by together.  A very odd sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild":

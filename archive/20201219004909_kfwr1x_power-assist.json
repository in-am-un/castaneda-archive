It's a progression of things you can do in a dark room, with my theories on what position of the assemblage point is utilized.  And the last step is \"practical magic\".\n\nIt requires most of the skills you can learn, but all at once.  It's also \"practical magic\" that doesn't interfere with the downward movement along the J curve, because it requires the dreaming double to lend a hand.  The \"practical magic\" Fancy has been teaching me, halts the downward movement.\n\nI had to do less of that.  But there's still room for it, further down on the J curve.\n\nBy the way, it's easier to do the last step in 2 parts.  Get your IOB to do a sock puppet show a bit, even if it's only her going up and down on your hand, simulating \"walking along\".  Turn her head left and right, and make sure it moves with your hand.\n\nNow you can look for a \"dream puff\" to insert her into.\n\nDream puffs mostly won't appear until after  your breath changes.  I suppose those are not quite the same as \"seeing energy on a horizon\", because that's a lot easier to do than to have dreams floating around on puffs, and stable enough to play with.\n\nLet's theorize: Seeing energy on a horizon is inevitable in darkroom gazing. It's caused by the assemblage point moving far enough to allow you to *see* energy.\n\nSeeing dream puffs requires a horizontal movement, from at least a depth of the red line in that J curve picture.\n\nBut who really knows?\n\nGood news is, we will. Someday. When we have hundreds exploring, and can compare notes from all of them.\n\nWhy did I use \"Places of Power\" flair on this one?\n\nBecause **everywhere** is a place of power, if you take Zuleica's advice.

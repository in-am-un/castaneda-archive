You make yourself some kind of super duper sorcerer dazzling web page, associate with some guillable Carlos followers, and get yourself stuck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t let go of being the super duper new nagual, but what you&amp;#39;re pretending to be is worse than if you&amp;#39;d just stuck with being a catholic.&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd everyone knows you&amp;#39;re a fraud.  But people come and comment favorably on your social media page, because they&amp;#39;re also frauds in something else, and know you&amp;#39;ll come give them a favorable comment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they build up your ego and you get to believe you&amp;#39;re actually doing ok, but know you aren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, you end up frantically retweeting several kitten videos a day, or worse, angry politics.  You do that not because you like kittens, or really believe the talking points, but because those are guaranteed to increase your social media views.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the retweet level reaches 3 per day, the suffering must be immensely worse than the plight of this man.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least he enjoyed reading Carlos&amp;#39; books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/c8h3qs/ian_dunbar_dont_wind_up_like_this_guy/esq6lln/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1562196531.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_c8h3qs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "esyuzui", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1562350125.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_esyu7nl", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I always felt like I was digging through a huge deep mudpit when I was looking for the pearls of irreducible truth in non-Nagualist materials.

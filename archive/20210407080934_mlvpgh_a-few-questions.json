Whenever I practice gazing, whether during my lunch break with my eyes closed or at night with my dark goggles, I always see this humanoid figure on the edge of my peripheral vision to my left. It starts as a vague dark cyan shape and becomes a more defined bright teal as my AP moves. I don't believe it's non-directional because when ever I try to look at it, it slides out of my view, but there's a very slight delay between when I look and when it starts moving. When I look to the right, it takes a split second to reappear on the edge of my periphery. I believe it to be an IOB trying to teach me something, but I can't figure out what it wants for the life of me.\n2. Mr. Doubletake seems to be stronger at night than during the day. When I practice on my lunchbreak I can see things that don't instantly vanish. Today I saw a shadow woman run across a purple puff and she had a patch of rainbow color on her lower back. Then I saw a shimmering bird fly across a puff. At night whenever something cool appears, it vanishes as soon as I turn my gaze toward it, or if it appears where I'm looking, it diminishes when I pay attention to it. I would think it would be easier to see at night because I've already moved my AP a bit earlier during the day, but that certainly isn't the case. At my small office, 9 of the 14 employees are female. Am I perhaps unknowingly borrowing their energy, or do you think this is a Doubletake problem?\n3. I've taken Dan's \"vow to be murdered by spirits in the most gruesome way possible\" twice now, once during my second week of practice I did it with the lights off before I started gazing, then I did it again the other day when I started to see phantoms. Neither seems to have had any effect. I feel like I need to put my personal spin on it, saying \"Kill me spirits, no balls,\" whenever I see something spooky feels right, but I'm worried I might offend/alienate the IOBs if I do this. Thoughts?\n4. Yesterday on my lunch break I saw a horizontal blue bar appear, flip violently, land back where it started, and then disappear. Not really sure that meant anything but I feel like it was worth mentioning. \n5. Anyone else \"see\" when they gaze at screens/TVs? It was a slow day at work the other day gazed at an email, half-assedly pretending to be busy. A line of reddish energy formed on top of a line of text, and after a while it slid up, then fell back down to the line of text. I've reproduced effect a few times, and sometimes I'll see a shimmering rainbow \"pixel\" on the screen amidst extremely vague purple puffs. Do you think it's worth my time to do this type of gazing in my down time or would my time be better spent elsewhere? An email can come in at any moment that I have to respond to so it feels kind of pointless to do this when I can be interrupted at any time.\n6. I'm confused about what exactly \"the wall\" is. The other day I woke up and hit the snooze button on my alarm, and in a half-asleep state I saw a concrete wall with bubbles moving/morphing in it. I was observing it for a moment but then I wasn't sure if I actually hit the snooze button or dismissed my alarm so I checked my phone and  I couldn't get the wall to come back. But when gazing I  sometimes see a puff of red static, like TV static but with red instead of white. If I'm silent enough while I gaze at this, a flurry of red letters runs across it, like a sandstorm but each grain of sand is instead a vague letter. Is this also the wall, or something else?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like I have a few more questions but I'm failing to remember them at the moment, I'll comment with them if they come to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance everyone, this subreddit is truly the most awesome place I've ever found", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A few questions", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_mlvpgh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1617775774.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post, I thought I would be able to answer some of these questions on my own but so far I&amp;#39;m left with more questions than answers&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Whenever I practice gazing, whether during my lunch break with my eyes closed or at night with my dark goggles, I always see this humanoid figure on the edge of my peripheral vision to my left.

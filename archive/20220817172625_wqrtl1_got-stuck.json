And there's a minimum amount of time, since we are learning to move the assemblage point.\n\nThe problem is, you can't define the minimum.  As Juann has also hinted, it's possible to greatly reduce that minimum with very SERIOUS effort.\n\nMeaning, absolute emphasis on silence, and on NEVER fantasizing while practicing.\n\nI bounced from reality to reality last night, and realized that even if you are silent, any \"fantasy\" during darkroom is invoking intent to return to the blue line.\n\nIntent can be summoned by many methods. It has to be \"flexible\" to handle the wide range of realities we can exist in.\n\nSo it looks for \"what you want\", or \"what you were thinking about\", even if it's beyond words.\n\nYou could be so silent, puffs are flowing intensely around you.\n\nBut to summon intent to open up a new world and let you go there for a while, takes more than silence or puffs.\n\nYou have to be \"fantasizing\" only about that.\n\nBy \"fantasizing\", I don't mean anything \"epic\".  It's doesn't have to be you in a boat in Italy with your true love, on a beautiful day with a gondola guy in stripes singing to you.\n\nIt could just be the lady selling flowers on the side of that river.   Just remembering her flowers alone, is a fantasy.\n\nEven if you completely forget who you rode in the boat with.\n\nThe flowers in your mind are enough to pull your assemblage point.\n\nSo if you can drop ALL fantasies, and are also silent, you can literally leave the darkroom.\n\nJump universes like Dr. Strange.\n\nCarlos did this all the time, as you can surmise from the inspirational quote about the blue scout, in \"Art of Dreaming\".  It was posted in the advanced subreddit, and it's a real eye opener when you understand that it's real!\n\nCarlos traveled all over the place, using intent as the vehicle!  And worried about running out of energy, worried about sharing what he saw with Carol, against don Juan's words.  Worried if the IOBs were up to no good.\n\nHe went through everything we do, which makes it all the more useful to read his writings, once you realize you're doing that too.  Running into the same issues as he did.\n\nSo when Juann says you can speed up the minimum time, or something implying that, it means you have to be \"perfect\".  No internal dialogue, no fantasizing, and then if you want to make sure, \"no rationality\".\n\nRationality is when you look at something and know what it is, what it is not, and what's it's good for.\n\nOr if it makes sense.\n\nGotta get rid of that too!\n\nIf you can picture this, your insides have to become a dark room too.  Nothing to see there either.  No prejudices, and no preferences.\n\nThen, the slightest \"intent\" will transport you there.\n\nInstantly!!!  Imagine getting to play with that for a half hour, consciously!\n\nIt's astounding. I bounced in and out of at least 10 distinct places, and lost 1 hour of more of them.  Who knows where I traveled.  I don't anymore.\n\nMemory is very difficult out there.\n\nHow can you recall what \"you\" did in a universe that's alien to this one, with a \"you\" that isn't necessarily human?\n\nCertainly not using the brain's storage!\n\nSo you can cheat and reduce the minimum time to practice each day, with \"unbending intent\".\n\nThen, here's the story Carlos told us.\n\nWhich works for all situations of learning sorcery.\n\nYou find a thread in the dirt, dig out one end of it and pull it up a bit to see if it keeps going.\n\nYou don't say, \"This is just a crummy thread.   I want that thick rope that sailors use!\"\n\nIt's a darned thread, in the dirt!  How did that get there?  What's its history?!?\n\nThat ought to be the attitude. Not disdain for something that seems unimportant.\n\nThat indicates the book deal mind, which is fatal.\n\nThe thread for us, is anything \"weird\" that happens.\n\nIf the thread doesn't break off and become useless as soon as you try to pull it up, you pull it up a little more, and dust off that part that's exposed. To see it clearly.  So you can find it the next day.  Leave a marker if you can, for where to look for the thread.\n\nThen each day you keep pulling on it, knowing for sure it's going to lead to something else.\n\nA string!  Then follow that.  And when that gets to a small rope, follow that.\n\nAlways \"follow the magic\", until there's a reason to stop following that thread of magic, and look for another.\n\nIf someone claims nothing is happening, that's a lost cause.  That person.\n\nFortunately, we aren't the lineages, and don't have to teach anyone at all.  \n\nWhat that person wants is NOT magic. It's something else.\n\nBut if they found even a tiny thing, they're in good shape.\n\nJust keep pulling on that thread each night, and it'll reveal more and more.\n\nIn panning for gold, they say you \"got colors\".\n\nPeople who go gold panning and look at the \"colors\" in the water, but don't get excited, will not become gold panners.\n\nThey want something else.  Nuggets to show their friends!  Cash in exchange for panning for gold.\n\nSomething other than the gold itself.\n\nThe ones who get excited over what doesn't even amount to the tiniest coin in the most bankrupt country, that proverbial \"widow's mite\",  are the ones who might become gold panners in the long run.\n\nAnd each time they go, they get better at it.\n\nI live in gold panning territory.\n\nI've never brought anyone gold panning that didn't get some gold.\n\nNone got excited over it.\n\nI had to give up on that activity as a fun thing to take people to see.", "edited": 1660760419.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ikopuno", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always the main thing is an obscure story Carlos told us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If everyone heeded his words, no one would have trouble finding their way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It applies to all sorcery paths: recap, gazing, stalking, dreaming, darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It always works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might take forever, but that really depends on how much time you put into it, and there&amp;#39;s no way for the sub to know who&amp;#39;s honest about how much work they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually they are not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just remember that if you put a LOT of time into it, you go faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Less time, slower.

Or would\u2019ve died of a heart attack. :D\n\nAll Nagual Julian was doing to him was social conditioning of the highest order, or rather, challenging social conditioning, thus messing with his assemblage point. Now, I have to say - that was not done to make Don Juan \u201cchallenge gender stereotypes\u201d lol, no, it was no gender studies field work, Nagual Julian was using those stereotypes to push Don Juan out of his comfort zone and into survival mode pretty much, which put him in the state of heightened awareness. \n\nYou have to keep in mind that on top of despising women and not wanting to be/ look like one for that reason, he also had to worry about people finding out that he was playing dress-up. Rigid patriarchal society doesn\u2019t take kindly to shaking gender norms - people could potentially attack, beat and kill him. It happens all the time with trans people even today, let alone in late 1800s - early 1900s when Don Juan\u2019s story was unfolding. \n\nSo, to sum it up - gender-bending theater that was unbearable due to misogyny, very real fear of physical harm from society and ON TOP OF ALL THAT - \u201cthe monster\u201d that was chasing him lol Yeah, all of that put him in the state of heightened awareness just like that.

Now, I have to say - that was not done to make Don Juan \u201cchallenge gender stereotypes\u201d lol, no, it was no gender studies field work, Nagual Julian was using those stereotypes to push Don Juan out of his comfort zone and into survival mode pretty much, which put him in the state of heightened awareness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to keep in mind that on top of despising women and not wanting to be/ look like one for that reason, he also had to worry about people finding out that he was playing dress-up.

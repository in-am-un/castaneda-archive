Stand in horse stance. Rapidly flick heels inwards, alternating sides.\n\n2. Exaggerated walk forward, swinging feet out to sides, starting with the left foot. as the left foot moves forward, the right arm comes down  in front of the body with a jerk, as the palm turns quickly from facing the left side to face the right side, thumb down. The left arm moves with the right leg. To go backwards, do a braid walk, swinging the arms horizontally across the body at chest level, but this time it's the right arm with the right leg, etc.\n\n3. Take a step forward with the left leg, then slide the right foot forward slightly;  take a step with the right foot, and slide the left forward, etc. To go backwards, take a step backwards with the left foot and slide the right foot, etc. Swing the shoulders.\n\n4. Horse stance; scrape the inside of the left foot along the ground to the right and lift the foot up about a foot high; repeat with the right foot, etc. Do this rapidly. A variation is to place the feet at about a 45 degree angle and do the scraping and lifting at this angle.\n\n5. Make pawing motion with the left foot 3 times; then with left foot behind the right, bend left leg, keeping the right leg straight, and the right foot flexed upward. You are supposed to flex the foot so that you feel the pull of the muscles on the front of the shin area (one of the 5 points). Repeat with the right leg. A variation is to do the pawing quickly and pause only slightly with the foot flexed upward.\n\n6. This is a very exaggerated braid-weave combo step [as in Recalling Dispersed Energy] forward. The backward step is a normal backward braid.\n\n7. The Paisley Step, because the pattern it forms on the floor looks like a paisley. Start with the weight on the left foot, and bring the right foot up, out to the right and then back along the left foot and then toe down behind and 90 degrees to the left foot. Then bring the right foot up again and along the left foot to the front of the body and out to the right side and back, toes down, to the same position behind the left foot. A variation is to pivot the moving foot at the end of each set so that you are facing 90 degrees from your previous position.\n\n8. The T-square step. Starting with the feet parallel and pointing forward, step out with the left foot, and then bring the right foot out in front of the left foot, making a \"T,\" with the right foot pointing toward the right. Then bring the left foot parallel and slightly ahead of the right foot, and continue making 90 degree T's, until you end up at your starting point. You can add the paisley step to this one as well.\n\n[http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/5616/SilvioManuelPasses.txt](http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/5616/SilvioManuelPasses.txt)  &amp; [Archive.org Backup](https://web.archive.org/web/19990222080507/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/5616/SilvioManuelPasses.txt)", "edited": 1694313598.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jzt2u0d", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silvio Manuel&amp;#39;s dance-style passes (from the set, that were eventually titled &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;The Twelve Mysterious Passes of Silvio Manuel and Juan Tuma&lt;/strong&gt;).

If you just met &amp;quot;the love of your life&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;re going to turn the knob left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not, you might tend to turn the knob right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One pass might &amp;quot;tend&amp;quot; to cause the radio knob to drift to the left, into the &amp;quot;inspirational stations&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another pass will tend to push the radio knob to the right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no one can absolutely say, each pass will land you on the same precise spot everyone else will see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus in some ways, a &amp;quot;virtual tensegrity teacher&amp;quot; who shows you what the designer of that teacher saw when they did the pass, is a &amp;quot;bad thing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos didn&amp;#39;t like giving out details like that, and neither did Taisha or Florinda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one learned!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So perhaps we can make multiple virtual teachers, with different &amp;quot;special effects&amp;quot; based on real people in our community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And god help you if you try out the virtual Cholita!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it would be fun to make one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now she&amp;#39;d be smoking a fine cigar and wondering if the big spider who took over our front door gets to live another day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/16e4moo/silvio_manuels_passes_magicalsorcerytensegrity/jztqkx0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1694273413.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_16e4moo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jzt6hse", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1694264914.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_16e4moo", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "**And what was spoken about this pass at a later date:**\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLos Angeles (5) - August 1997\n\nTo:   The Ixtlan Mailing List\n\nDate:   Mon, 6 Oct 1997 12:13:23 -0400 (EDT)\n\nLA WORKSHOP, August 23 to 27, 1997\n\nby Vincent Sargenti and Randy Stark\n\nDAY Five (morning)\n\nWednesday . . .

The encrustation is like a bark on the outer portion of the inside of our luminous cocoon. The passes bring oxygen and blood flow to the vital organs and energetic centers. That actually helps to regenerate the vital organs and bring vitality and vigor to the body. This in itself is enough to help dispel disease. Do the passes everyday,\" she said. \"ME is a set of concerns that gives us an overabundance of worry, tension and concern. All of this combines, and with the years sets us up to fall prey to disease.\"\n\n(She stressed 'disease' as two words: dis-ease.)\n\nFlorinda at one point, talking about her father the General and about her German heritage, joked that if she were taller and had balls she'd have a whip right now and would be a commander. But since she was a 'mushroom' she'd ended up on the sorcerers' path, which in the end was very fortunate for her.\n\nFlorinda introduced some of the sixteen people who formed the 'shamanistic unit', primarily the Elements since they were the ones in the audience at the time. As she introduced each by name and they stood up, she made reference to their academic credentials and respective professional fields. It seemed that she did this in order to evoke a sense that within the social order these people were tremendously accomplished and disciplined individuals. She apparently wanted us to know that we were not dealing with a bunch of high school kids.\n\nThe six Elements: Miles is an MD. Brandon has a masters degree in psychology and is a practicing psychologist specializing in domestic violence. Gavin has two Ph.D.s -- one in biology, and one in the Earth sciences. Fabrizio is an investment banker/consultant.

Reni and Nyei Murez, the cousins, are English teachers. Reni is finishing law school, Nyei is pursuing a career in editing. Talia Bey is the president of Cleargreen. And last but not least, the current pursuits of Kylie, Erin, Darien and the newest Energy Tracker, Haley, were not mentioned.\n\n(Some of the above information may not be entirely accurate. Not all of it was derived from Florinda's comments.)\n\nAfter Florinda and Taisha's Q/A period, and a short break, the Elements quickly reviewed the Unbending Purpose and The Legs Rule Vitality series. The Energy Trackers then came out and quickly reviewed, On the Run and The Wheel of Time.\n\nDAY Five (afternoon, evening)\n\nAfter the review session ended at noon there was a ten minute break in which nothing much seemed to be happening. Participants had been asked to stay half an hour later for a special session to 'arm' the passes of Silvio Manuel and Juan Tuma. Suddenly it became apparent that everyone was gathering around the stage, but in an unusual way. There was a large area left clear in front of the stage that was perhaps the size of a dance floor. Taisha, Florinda and Carol entered the room with a group of Energy Trackers and Elements.\n\nFlorinda took the stage with a beaming smile, as if she had a cat in a bag. She laughed and asked the group to quiet their wild, energetic applause. She said they had a special treat for everyone and that they had a special guest with them who was going to introduce us to the idea of the shamanistic theater as well as demonstrate not-doing for us.\n\nAmong Silvio Manuel's many talents, Florinda said, perhaps the most breathtaking was his unbelievable agility as a dancer.\n\n\"There has never been anyone before or since who could dance with such flair, such passion, who could move with such speed and such unbelievable grace,\" Florinda said admiringly, her smile bright as the sun.\n\n\"The others have told you their stories about how Silvio Manuel affected them, what he was like for them. To them he was an awesome, terrible figure who struck fear and terror into them. He was a sorcerer of inconceivable power and mystery, someone who, for them the mere mention of his name brought about the quintessence of fear. For me, he was not like that at all. I loved Silvio Manuel. To me, he was like a rich uncle who doted on his niece with tremendous affection. I shared a special affinity with and had immense affection for Silvio Manuel. He was someone I grew to adore. Nobody could dance like Silvio Manuel. Nobody.\"\n\nFlorinda spoke as if she were truly and utterly enamored of the man.\n\n\"He used to entertain don Juan and his cohorts, and of course us, to no end with his incredible ability to move and to dance. These songs that we have played here for you were the songs that Silvio Manuel himself used to play over and over again. They were particular favorites of his. The reason we play them over and over for you is that we want you to have a taste of what it was like to have been around him. This is a taste of the mood of Silvio Manuel. This is the music he would fill the air with for entire afternoons, and there would be dancing and much laughter. We want to steep you in the mood of Silvio Manuel.\n\n\"The useless hope is something that a warrior feels in his heart. He dances his movements of impeccability in the presence of infinity and his dance is his expression to the infinite, his display of his impeccability. His dance is a show of his gratitude to the infinite for his having had the opportunity to live. He dances his dance with all the flair and passion and precision that he can muster. He knows his dance is a dance of useless hope . . . but he has no other way, no other course for his expression. So he dances his expression to the infinite. He knows that he is up against inconceivable odds and realizes that he may never be able to find his freedom. So he dances before infinity to this useless hope.\"\n\nAt this point, Florinda introduced the only person she had ever met in her lifetime who captured the power, flair and passion with which Silvio Manuel had once danced.\n\nShe said, \"Ladies and gentleman, it is my tremendous pleasure to introduce to you, Maricio Caballero. The quintessential ballroom dancer. Beware, he is a terrible womanizer and he is extremely seductive.\"\n\nAt this point, one of the Energy Trackers emerged from the side of the room. But wait, it wasn't one of the Trackers, it was indeed Maricio Caballero. He was sporting greased back, jet-black hair and a leisure suit. Carrying his sport coat over his shoulder, he swaggered in with a handful of long-stemmed cornflowers, throwing them and kisses to all the ladies. He was the epitome of machismo and male seductiveness. At the same time he was imbued with an utter sense of confidence and skill.\n\nAs the music began, the audience was given a taste of something that defies description, something that stirred the very depths of the heart and displayed the essence of the Warrior's Way. A dance of incalculable power and beauty followed, one that took the audience completely by surprise and utterly by storm. The movements were ones we had been learning, yet suddenly they were displayed before us with all the spirit and flair and infinite heart that you could ever imagine being in the path of don Juan's lineage of sorcerers. A great number of the participants were moved to tears, others to laughter, some to dismay.\n\nOne of the high points of the workshop came when, as the song 'Useless Hope' played, all the participants were invited to join in the dance and share in the mood of Silvio Manuel and Juan Tuma. Taisha, Florinda and Carol jumped to their feet and joined in the dance as Maricio Caballero took a woman at random from the audience and began to show her how to Lambada. Then, in an instant, every participant was on their feet and moving freely around the room, dancing the passes with the sorcerers as the music of 'Useless Hope' played on.\n\n.....***(comment was getting too long for Reddit to allow, the rest is in the source page)***\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20030711180736/http://www.nagual.com/ixtlan/notes/0897f.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20030711180736/http://www.nagual.com/ixtlan/notes/0897f.html)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jzt6hse", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And what was spoken about this pass at a later date:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Los Angeles (5) - August 1997&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To:   The Ixtlan Mailing List&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Date:   Mon, 6 Oct 1997 12:13:23 -0400 (EDT)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LA WORKSHOP, August 23 to 27, 1997&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;by Vincent Sargenti and Randy Stark&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DAY Five (morning)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wednesday . . .

We were early arrivals and no one else was visible. It was twilight, almost dark. As we approached the cafeteria, I saw two women standing about 5 feet apart. As I drew near, I had the uncanny feeling that I was about to cross a threshold, and these women were the guardians. They were expressionless, but as I came close they smiled. I relaxed, taking that as a good omen as I passed them.\n\nFor the rest of the workshop, I felt that I was participating in some ongoing mythical drama, protected within the bubble marked by the sentry positions. Friday night we had a lecture followed by Tensegrity practice, a pattern that repeated during each of the following morning, afternoon, and evening sessions. As about 150-200 people sat on cushions surrounding a small rectangular platform, an entourage entered from the entrance on the left. Up leapt a beaming Carlos Castaneda to the stage. I could hardly focus on his face. He was not at all what I expected. He was very short, lean, grey-haired, almost 70 years old. In contrast to the Carlos in the books, he was warm, jovial, funny, and confident. He looked like a huggable old man. Several people did hug him after he left the stage. He was very enthusiastic about these workshops, full of praise at the progress being made by the participants. He weaved through the crowd as we began the Tensegrity instruction, urging us on with expansive hand movements. It occurred to me that for us, Carlos had become don Juan.\n\nI won't go into the content of the lectures in this article, just briefly sketch what happened. We were to hear Carlos lecture 3 times that weekend. We also heard lectures by Florinda Donner-Grau, Taisha Abelar, Carol Tiggs, and the Blue Scout (her first appearance at a workshop). FDG looked like a little pixie, very diminutive and very short, almost white hair. Taisha looked the oldest by far, and a deep sadness was etched in her face. I learned the reason when she related the story about Manfred the dog warrior, and how most of her being crossed over to serve as a beacon, leaving only a shell behind in this world. She is a woman of great inner passion. Carol was a big surprise - she looked no more than 35 years. In contrast with the other witches who spoke in slow, deliberate, and academic terms, Carol was a motor mouth who seemed totally ordinary - her speech could have been that of any average person at work or perhaps a neighbor. The only difference was that the content of her speech was totally outrageous by ordinary standards. The Blue Scout was about 23, who at times was nervous and other times confident and eloquent. All had short hair.\n\nThe Chacmools were magnificient in their various uniforms and total dedication to their task. Every session they wore different matching uniforms. They worked me very hard in learning 3 major passes (Recollecting dispersed energy with the hands and feet, Two energy circles, and Sending and Receiving energy) as well as eight minor passes arranged by Silvio Manuel. Many people had been to many previous Tensegrity practice sessions, and I had to struggle to keep up with the rest, who seemed to perform the movements at a dizzying pace. Taisha said that while we were practicing the Silvio Manuel passes, that she saw a huge boulder face pressed against the glass double doors at the cafeteria entrance. Taisha identified the face as the spirit of Silvio Manuel, looking in on us.\n\nDuring the last session Carlos showed up in a suit and talked for two hours. This time chairs were on the floor, and many people dressed up for the occasion. I still was wearing my sweat shirt and pants.\n\nCarlos said on the last night that they hit us with every thing they had. It is the job of the Nagual to crack the sealed chamber in which we reside. They applied constant pressure on us by keeping us long hours, demanding our attention during long lectures, and pushing us to learn complex movements. They taxed our bodies and minds in alternation. These people are totally serious practitioners. They live a life that is totally outside the rules of ordinary social life. It was weird and exciting to come into contact with that kind of wild energy.\n\nThe key to the workshop is full participation and attention to what is going on. Some people go to hear the lectures and give lip service to the Tensegrity practice. This attitude falls short of what they demand and will leave one only on the periphery of the action. One of the witches said that the discipline of a warrior demands that one place their full attention on whatever is in front of them.

We were early arrivals and no one else was visible. It was twilight, almost dark. As we approached the cafeteria, I saw two women standing about 5 feet apart. As I drew near, I had the uncanny feeling that I was about to cross a threshold, and these women were the guardians. They were expressionless, but as I came close they smiled. I relaxed, taking that as a good omen as I passed them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the workshop, I felt that I was participating in some ongoing mythical drama, protected within the bubble marked by the sentry positions. Friday night we had a lecture followed by Tensegrity practice, a pattern that repeated during each of the following morning, afternoon, and evening sessions. As about 150-200 people sat on cushions surrounding a small rectangular platform, an entourage entered from the entrance on the left. Up leapt a beaming Carlos Castaneda to the stage. I could hardly focus on his face. He was not at all what I expected. He was very short, lean, grey-haired, almost 70 years old. In contrast to the Carlos in the books, he was warm, jovial, funny, and confident. He looked like a huggable old man. Several people did hug him after he left the stage. He was very enthusiastic about these workshops, full of praise at the progress being made by the participants. He weaved through the crowd as we began the Tensegrity instruction, urging us on with expansive hand movements. It occurred to me that for us, Carlos had become don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t go into the content of the lectures in this article, just briefly sketch what happened. We were to hear Carlos lecture 3 times that weekend. We also heard lectures by Florinda Donner-Grau, Taisha Abelar, Carol Tiggs, and the Blue Scout (her first appearance at a workshop). FDG looked like a little pixie, very diminutive and very short, almost white hair. Taisha looked the oldest by far, and a deep sadness was etched in her face. I learned the reason when she related the story about Manfred the dog warrior, and how most of her being crossed over to serve as a beacon, leaving only a shell behind in this world. She is a woman of great inner passion. Carol was a big surprise - she looked no more than 35 years. In contrast with the other witches who spoke in slow, deliberate, and academic terms, Carol was a motor mouth who seemed totally ordinary - her speech could have been that of any average person at work or perhaps a neighbor. The only difference was that the content of her speech was totally outrageous by ordinary standards. The Blue Scout was about 23, who at times was nervous and other times confident and eloquent. All had short hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Chacmools were magnificient in their various uniforms and total dedication to their task. Every session they wore different matching uniforms. They worked me very hard in learning 3 major passes (Recollecting dispersed energy with the hands and feet, Two energy circles, and Sending and Receiving energy) as well as eight minor passes arranged by Silvio Manuel. Many people had been to many previous Tensegrity practice sessions, and I had to struggle to keep up with the rest, who seemed to perform the movements at a dizzying pace. Taisha said that while we were practicing the Silvio Manuel passes, that she saw a huge boulder face pressed against the glass double doors at the cafeteria entrance. Taisha identified the face as the spirit of Silvio Manuel, looking in on us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the last session Carlos showed up in a suit and talked for two hours. This time chairs were on the floor, and many people dressed up for the occasion. I still was wearing my sweat shirt and pants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos said on the last night that they hit us with every thing they had. It is the job of the Nagual to crack the sealed chamber in which we reside. They applied constant pressure on us by keeping us long hours, demanding our attention during long lectures, and pushing us to learn complex movements. They taxed our bodies and minds in alternation. These people are totally serious practitioners. They live a life that is totally outside the rules of ordinary social life. It was weird and exciting to come into contact with that kind of wild energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key to the workshop is full participation and attention to what is going on. Some people go to hear the lectures and give lip service to the Tensegrity practice. This attitude falls short of what they demand and will leave one only on the periphery of the action. One of the witches said that the discipline of a warrior demands that one place their full attention on whatever is in front of them. Carlos honed his attention during a period of one year when he had to listen to a drunk talk to him every morning for an hour as he left his apartment. He had to give the drunk his full attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certain themes were stressed again and again in the workshop. Attention is one theme. Another big theme is the relentless attack on the ego. There are many opportunities for ego to manifest during the workshop, and the Chacmools know them all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we filed out after the final session I passed again through the boundaries marked by the guardians, and barely felt the sorcerers world recede, as the normal world again asserted itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent much time having great discussions with Bob P. and Mark G.

While it's easy to spot a \"social media sorcerer\" by that fact that they're pretentious and phony and only quote the books, it's harder to spot someone who's making up stuff about having passed various gates of dreaming.\n\nHowever, if someone really has passed some gates in dreaming, you ought to hear something like, \"Oh my god man!  You have no idea how much effort that took.   I practically had to bleed each time I wanted dreaming. Here's my technique. Maybe it'll help you to.\"\n\nIf you hear something like, \"Yea dude, I'm up to the 3rd gate of dreaming\", you have what I consider the perils of \"The Art of Dreaming\u201d.  You can essentially stop yourself from ever learning sorcery by pacifying your mind with ordinary dreams hand selected to match what\u2019s in that book.\n\nWaking dreaming does not take more effort.  But it\u2019s a less obvious effort, perhaps not as immediately rewarding as believing you\u2019re doing something wonderful, like trying to pass all the gates.\n\nBoth need the same kind of effort: concentration.  \n\nFor more lucid dreaming, you need to concentrate on trying to enter dreaming manually, while you lie on your side in bed, or sit in a chair.  And for that to succeed, you need silence.  Then, you need to learn to go back into dreams, by remaining still, and visualizing the last thing you saw. And finally, you have to desperately hold on to any dreaming you get, carefully learning what makes you lose lucidity.  If you practice all of those, you\u2019ll learn to change dreams, which is what really helps sustain it. It\u2019s fairly easy to remain lucid in dreaming for hours, or to bounce from one dream to the other, for half a day.\n\nWaking dreaming requires the same kind of effort.  Zuleica\u2019s technique is the model.  She\u2019s from the planet of the dreamers in don Juan\u2019s group.\n\nBut the advantage of Zuleica\u2019s technique, over the \u201cGates of Dream\u201d method, is that you enter into heightened awareness first, and then into the dream.\n\nThat insures you won\u2019t lose lucidity. In fact, there\u2019s no effort required at all, other than not to get too obsessed with the dream storyline, or you might believe you live there.\n\nAnother bonus of waking dreaming is that you are not asleep.  You\u2019re awake.  Or maybe sleepwalking.   But definitely not asleep, as you can end that dream at any time, just by turning your head to face back into the real world.\n\nHow you get offered to enter the worlds you can assemble with silence and darkness? I haven\u2019t figured that out.  If you can go in, you just know it.  If you can\u2019t, you also know it.  \n\nIf you try to fight about not being able to enter, you\u2019ll soon discover that although you can see the world you want to enter right there on your wall, it is in fact further away than the actual wall of your room. And it remains at that distance as if you were sitting on a rock watching it, even if you try to walk towards it.   It\u2019s always at the same distance.\n\nIt has to become \u201cdirectional\u201d, or \u201clocated at that spot I can see there\u201d, in order to enter it.    \n\nThe best analogy I can come up with is, if you are looking at an 85\u201d television screen view of a village, you don\u2019t get confused into believing it\u2019s an open window view of the same scene.\n\nMethods of entry I\u2019ve tried: Walking in,  leaping in if the location of the new world is downwards and at an angle (in other words, you really could leap down there if you weren\u2019t afraid of injury),  and just \u201cbeing\u201d in the new world as a result of having noticed it, but also being here at the same time.  You sense your presence in both. \n\nThen you have a choice, and that old head turning thing from Carlos\u2019 books takes on meaning.  It really does feel like you just turned your head to face a new direction, and that direction was into the second attention.\n\nWith Zuleica\u2019s technique, you are guaranteed to get dreaming every single night, as long as you have enough hours.

It was the only thing that came to my mind when I felt it. It was amazing, and awesome. And tangible, and brownish, if that makes any sense. But especially, alien and weird.\n\n I\u2019d been sitting on the bed, looked over to the left on the floor, and saw a blob of lights.  It was the same type of blob that the low energy inorganics appear from, which is distinct from Carlos\u2019 allies. \n\nUsually I don\u2019t see that blob stuck to the floor. It mostly floats around, and likes to sit on the second attention\u2019s assemblage point when I do the harp playing movements there.   This time it was stuck to the floor, so I have to assume it was another inorganic and not the one I normally interact with.  Maybe it was the small rodent I see occasionally, and I finally got a glimpse of it\u2019s \u201creal\u201d form.\n\nIt gave off that incredible weird feeling. When I felt it, the thought occurred to me that this is why humans need their second attention.  Just like they need the darkness, and the wind, and fright, they need that weird alien energy, to keep them from becoming too cozy with the world of the tonal.  If you combined wind, darkness, and fright, but made it pleasant, you\u2019d have something very close to this alien energy.\n\n\nHere\u2019s what don Juan said about it after Carlos asked him what the dreaming emissary was.  \n\n\"Alien energy that has conciseness. Alien energy that purports to aid dreamers by telling them things. The problem with the dreaming emissary is that it can tell only what the sorcerers already know or should know, were they worth their salt.\"\n\n\"To say that it's alien energy that has conciseness doesn't help me at all, don Juan. What kind of energy - benign, malignant, right, wrong, what?\"\n\n\"It's just what I said, alien energy. An impersonal force that we turn into a very personal one because it has voice. Some sorcerers swear by it. They even see it. Or, as you yourself have done, they simply hear it as a man's or a woman's voice. And the voice can tell them about the state of things, which most of the time they take as sacred advice.\"\n\n\"Why do some of us hear it as a voice?\"\n\n\"We see it or hear it because we maintain our assemblage points fixed on a specific new position; the more intense this fixation, the more intense our experience of the emissary. Watch out! You may see it and feel it as a naked woman.\"\n\n\"Is this force capable of materializing itself?\" I asked.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he replied. \"And it all depends on how fixed the assemblage point is. But, rest assured, if you are capable of maintaining a degree of detachment, nothing happens. The emissary remains what it is: an impersonal force that acts on us because of the fixation of our assemblage points. \u201c\n\n\n\nSo from this I conclude, the *dreaming emissary*, which oddly Carlos put in italics like *dreaming* and *seeing*, is a composite of the things that can happen when your assemblage point is flexible but still homesick, and you encounter something \u201creal\u201d mixed in with your dreaming.  \n\nIn dreaming, and also waking dreaming (which seems to be an entirely different realm), you often run into strange things.  I was once somewhere else, possibly after having stopped the world.  My current technique for that is to watch colors and manipulate them in darkness using tensegrity, while forcing silence, and keep it up until the colors are very bright and there\u2019s signs of other worlds on the walls.  That indicates I\u2019m in heightened awareness and can stop moving around, because I won\u2019t fall asleep if I remain still. So I go back to the bed and force out any remaining thoughts or mental images.  Occasionally that will stop the world.  \n\nBut the problem is remembering it.  One time, I only noticed it because someone shouted my full name.  That brought me back from wherever I\u2019d been, but I couldn\u2019t recall even a tiny bit of it.  The voice was very clear, but as soon as I noticed what was going in, it had faded to almost nothing. I had to revive it from my memory.\n\nI\u2019ve also been brought back from being blanked out during recapitulation, by a loud knocking on the door.  A few times, a telephone rang.  But in both of those cases, the sound has a quality that makes it easy to tell it wasn\u2019t really the phone or the door, despite how loud it was.  And it didn\u2019t repeat the way a knock or phone ring would.  Also, I got tired of getting up to check and finding nothing.\n\nAs for Allies speaking in dreaming or in waking dreaming, I can honestly say I\u2019ve never heard them speak.  I\u2019ve seen them frantically try to tell me things, including gesturing with their hands.  But there was no audible sound.  And in truth, faced with Carlos\u2019 pajama wearing ally, the last thing you\u2019re thinking about is turning up the audio.  \n\nIn dreaming I\u2019ve found myself becoming lucid, while sitting next to a dreaming entity I recognize as a form the inorganics can take.  They just sort of hang out as long as they can, as close up as they can, and try to get you to interact with them.    In those cases when I become lucid and try to figure out what the situation is, I have the impression that we\u2019ve been talking for a long time. But I still can\u2019t recall any actual sound. \n\nOne time I recalled some words, then realized I was probably the one who said those.  I got the image of a psychiatrist with a notepad, jutting his pencil a bit to encourage me to elucidate on my last statement.  I believed I was in a conversation, but actually the being never said anything.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of Inorganic Being behavior for those of you who are potential dreamers. It\u2019s from what a couple of people wrote to me in the last few days, but I\u2019ll combine it because I don\u2019t recall which part is from whom.\n\nHe ran into a bunch of turmoil in dreaming, that triggered him becoming lucid, he looked around, and there were Lego blocks all over the floor.  If he tried to take a step, they seemed to move to be under his foot, and it actually hurt!  He forced himself to wake up, found himself in bed with his girlfriend, but then remembered she was visiting her relatives elsewhere.   That startled him, and he woke up again.  This time for real.\n\nThat\u2019s an Ally following him through dream changes.    Could it have spoken along the way?  Seems to be a tossup.\n\nI'll venture my opinion on inorganics: They're everywhere!  We're up to our ears in them.  They aren't rare or hard to acquire.  \n\nIf Carlos' allies are different, it's probably mostly a matter of energy.  \n\nMyself, I like the ones that aren't as scary.\n\nEdited: twice", "edited": 1563990332.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_eur1v4n", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good topic for today because this morning I ran into \u201cAwesome Sauce\u201d energy around 5AM.

It\u2019s from what a couple of people wrote to me in the last few days, but I\u2019ll combine it because I don\u2019t recall which part is from whom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He ran into a bunch of turmoil in dreaming, that triggered him becoming lucid, he looked around, and there were Lego blocks all over the floor.  If he tried to take a step, they seemed to move to be under his foot, and it actually hurt!  He forced himself to wake up, found himself in bed with his girlfriend, but then remembered she was visiting her relatives elsewhere.   That startled him, and he woke up again.  This time for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s an Ally following him through dream changes.    Could it have spoken along the way?  Seems to be a tossup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll venture my opinion on inorganics: They&amp;#39;re everywhere!  We&amp;#39;re up to our ears in them.  They aren&amp;#39;t rare or hard to acquire.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Carlos&amp;#39; allies are different, it&amp;#39;s probably mostly a matter of energy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myself, I like the ones that aren&amp;#39;t as scary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_cgvl4s", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/cgvl4s/sit_down_shut_up_and_quiet_your_mind/eur1v4n/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1563988469.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "eunqsvm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_eunemqb", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "And what about the voice of the dreaming emissary?

And it's very clear, and quite surprising.  It sums something up in a brilliant manner.\n\nThe classic example I like to give is from back in the late 80s.   I reverse engineered the original Nintendo game machine.  Yep, Mario Bros.  I took a screwdriver, opened it up, and proceeded to make 35 video games for it.\n\nBut after I\u2019d produced and sold game #10, Nintendo got a patent on the shape of the game cartridge, and sent us a threatening letter.  We had to stop or they\u2019d sue.\n\nThe patent was bogus!  It was for putting a 45-degree bevel on the cartridge, so you couldn\u2019t insert it upside down.  The slot could only take a cartridge with that bevel. \n\nBut if you had the bevel, you violated the patent.\n\nI was out of business, or so it seemed. I went home, sat in a chair, forced myself silent, and waited for the second attention to show up.  \n\nI fell asleep, my head jerked forward a bit, I lifted it back up, and right there in the air was a video game cartridge. It was floating in front of my eyes, in full 3D, rotating so that I could see it from all angles.\n\nI stared at it dumbfounded,  not understanding what I was seeing.\n\nA voice said, \u201cHey, LOOK!!!   See how it\u2019s flat, but skinny enough to slide over the bevel?\u201d  I looked at it and sure enough, the cartridge was simply very thin.  \n\nI had no idea if it would really slide over the bevel.  I rushed back to work, mocked one up, tried it out, and found out it was true.  You could get around their patent.\n\nI\u2019ve heard the voice of seeing come out like that, at least 8 times.  It just blurts out the answer to something, while you\u2019re watching it.  It almost feels like, if you figured out what you were looking at, it would keep silent. But if you\u2019re too stupid to see the obvious, it comes out.\n\nHowever, it can manifest in multiple ways.  Carlos\u2019 \u201cwall\u201d can manifest images, they can sort themselves out while you watch,  and only at the very end does the voice of seeing come in to summarize what you just watched.\n\nWhile they\u2019re sorting themselves out, you have realizations.  This one is the same as that one, that one isn\u2019t needed if the other is present, and so on.   Except that, they're abstract so that I couldn't even tell you a single thing about them.  You just realize stuff while the visions flow. The realizations seem to drive the movement of the wall, the same way looking at an Ally forces it to change appearance.\n\nIn that case, the voice doesn\u2019t actually have to be present at all because you sort of \u201cworry\u201d, in order to see.  Your silent mind can use any information you have, conceptualize and visualize it, and give you a super advantage understanding the information. It\u2019s like having the FBI drive up with their special task force high-tech truck, to help you find your lost car keys.   That\u2019s what one form of seeing is like, and that form doesn\u2019t need the voice.\n\nI suspect for you guys, the first way you\u2019ll hear the voice of seeing is by practicing silence sitting in a chair.  Close your eyes, relax, and force silence.  Eventually you\u2019ll shift into the second attention.\n\nIt\u2019s very likely it\u2019ll eventually talk to you.  But not the way crazy people have voices in their heads.  In this case, you\u2019re silent, but you have a thought. And the thought is persistent. It\u2019s clearly not the usual flow of the internal dialogue.\n\nI suggest, it\u2019ll be angry with you at first.  Because you\u2019ve banished half of yourself into darkness.  When you bring it back, it\u2019s still a bit angry with you. It\u2019ll curse you or criticize you.\n\nAll this is likely somewhat personal, although I suspect there will tend to be categories of people. Like farts have one thing happen, pisses have another, and so on.  Carlos used to go on about the types of people.  Maybe the voice of seeing is the same for all fart type people.\n\nI have one person who writes to me, who has learned to bring out the second attention, using a combination of gazing and sitting in a chair with eyes closed.\n\nHe reports that his voice of seeing is prolific.  It\u2019s constant, and seems to want to explain every single vision he has.\n\nI guess he got lucky, and it wasn\u2019t all that angry with him for being away so long.", "edited": 1563927991.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_eunemqb", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have.

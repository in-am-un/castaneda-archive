We can't from what you write, because it's not open about the actual experience.\n\nIt doesn't have the flavor of someone who worked hard to learn.   People who work hard to learn realize how nearly impossible that is, and want to encourage others to work hard, knowing that's the only way it works.\n\nThere's none of that in there. Instead, it's filled with doubt and self-pity.\n\nAnd you don't even bother to tell us if drugs were involved in all this.\n\nYou're hiding the details, to make it sound better.  And you're emphasizing yourself in the account.\n\nI'd say whoever he or she is, the inorganic beings,  she's been reading too many books outside the sorcery tradition. I hear shades of all sorts of things in there.  Those will make it impossible for you to reach heightened awareness.\n\nThat's a bit of a joke.  About the IOB reading too much stuff.\n\nThey pick up our obsessions and repeat them to us as if we'd asked a question.\n\nAnd they don't have to read, because they already know what's in a book.\n\n(I'd like to see them try that with an intense technical manual.)\n\nYou worry me when you say you were \"practicing  your seeing\".\n\nHow?  What's the technique?  Can you share with us how you learned it?  Do you talk in another chat somewhere, about \"your seeing\"?    What exactly do you tell them?  How to do it?  If so, where are people who learned to do that.\n\nThat's the purpose of this subreddit.  To share techniques which someone else can actually try, and over time we can learn what works.\n\n\"Talent\" is not something you can share.\n\nYou can get little bits of seeing just by activating the second attention.  Half asleep visions even qualify as seeing from time to time.\n\nIntuition that's successful, qualifies as seeing.\n\nAnything that comes from internal silence qualifies.  Falling asleep due to silence, and coming back with a memory of a fast dream you barely recall, also qualifies as seeing.\n\nBut the kind of seeing you can \"practice\" requires \"seeing energy\", and that happens in the orange zone on the J curve.  You have to be able to move your assemblage point further than any Buddhist, yogi, or Daoist even knows it can move.\n\nI doubt you learned to do that.

You&amp;#39;re still mostly self-absorbed, meaning, viewing yourself in terms of getting attention from others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to label it mental masturbation ignores that you can move the assemblage point with stalking and not-doing, and that once it moves inorganic beings like to come play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it ignores witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably mostly Carlos would say such harsh things to &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; people, and try to force them to become more serious and get back to work on a consistent basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire community has fallen into a pit of pretending, and it&amp;#39;s easy to join them if you aren&amp;#39;t careful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But only you can figure out if you really have an inorganic being friend.  We can&amp;#39;t from what you write, because it&amp;#39;s not open about the actual experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t have the flavor of someone who worked hard to learn.   People who work hard to learn realize how nearly impossible that is, and want to encourage others to work hard, knowing that&amp;#39;s the only way it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s none of that in there. Instead, it&amp;#39;s filled with doubt and self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you don&amp;#39;t even bother to tell us if drugs were involved in all this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re hiding the details, to make it sound better.  And you&amp;#39;re emphasizing yourself in the account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say whoever he or she is, the inorganic beings,  she&amp;#39;s been reading too many books outside the sorcery tradition. I hear shades of all sorts of things in there.  Those will make it impossible for you to reach heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a bit of a joke.  About the IOB reading too much stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They pick up our obsessions and repeat them to us as if we&amp;#39;d asked a question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they don&amp;#39;t have to read, because they already know what&amp;#39;s in a book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;d like to see them try that with an intense technical manual.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You worry me when you say you were &amp;quot;practicing  your seeing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How?  What&amp;#39;s the technique?  Can you share with us how you learned it?  Do you talk in another chat somewhere, about &amp;quot;your seeing&amp;quot;?    What exactly do you tell them?  How to do it?  If so, where are people who learned to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the purpose of this subreddit.  To share techniques which someone else can actually try, and over time we can learn what works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Talent&amp;quot; is not something you can share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can get little bits of seeing just by activating the second attention.  Half asleep visions even qualify as seeing from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intuition that&amp;#39;s successful, qualifies as seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything that comes from internal silence qualifies.  Falling asleep due to silence, and coming back with a memory of a fast dream you barely recall, also qualifies as seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the kind of seeing you can &amp;quot;practice&amp;quot; requires &amp;quot;seeing energy&amp;quot;, and that happens in the orange zone on the J curve.  You have to be able to move your assemblage point further than any Buddhist, yogi, or Daoist even knows it can move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I doubt you learned to do that.  Because if you had, your post would be about that, and not about your friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: You may be talented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you need to get rid of that internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/obm3vw/would_like_some_feedback/h3oubv7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1625151704.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_obm3vw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_obm3vw", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h3p27f3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h3osqyo", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Rather than looking forward, work so it happens as a direct result of your efforts, rather than a gift from intent. \n\nWe all get those. \n\nBuilding off of them is **the** differentiation that actually makes you a sorcerer (master of intent).", "edited": 1625169156.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h3p27f3", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than looking forward, work so it happens as a direct result of your efforts, rather than a gift from intent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all get those. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Building off of them is &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt;

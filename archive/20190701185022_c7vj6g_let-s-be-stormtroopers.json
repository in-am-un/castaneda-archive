If you\u2019re easily offended, skip it.\n\nIn Carlos\u2019 private classes, there were a lot of \u201cspiritual\u201d people.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising. Many had read Carlos\u2019 books long ago, but were unable to get instruction from anyone they believed understood it.\n\nAnd being like most people, they had a subconscious belief that knowledge had to be \u201cimparted\u201d from a learned person, to the student.    It didn\u2019t occur to them that the only way you learn is on your own, and the person hanging around pretending to teach you is just someone who didn\u2019t want to, or was too obnoxious, to get a normal job.\n\nIn pursuit of people to impart knowledge to them, they became Buddhists, Yogis, Taoists, and Weird self-improvement cult members.  Being a member of any of those groups includes a fair amount of hazing, to insure cult loyalty.\n\nPerhaps due to the hazing, they did indeed become quite annoying while waiting to get into Carlos private classes.  That was one of the things which stood out the most. Nearly everyone had horrible affectations.\nThey\u2019d typically be banished to the far end of the room, at any normal public gathering.  People would complain to each other when they showed up.\n\nI don\u2019t know if they were actually raised by their mom to be that way, and the topic of \u201csorcery\u201d hand selected them to end up in Carlos\u2019 classes.   Or maybe they became that way over time.\n\nIn general, people who try to get free from the social order tend to be at odds with it.    They discover too soon that the hype doesn\u2019t live up to the results.\n\nBut the social order puts a bag over people\u2019s heads, so that they don\u2019t notice how it actually doesn\u2019t live up to its promises.  Typically, people don\u2019t fully realize they\u2019ve been had, until they\u2019re well past 50.\nAnd likely most never realize it.  They just switch to emphasizing the family religion, so that they can have new promises of a happy future.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like a hooker who loves her pimp, and will find any tiny sign of love or encouragement from him, to justify her hellish life. Even if he completely lets her down, as long as she can find some promise of goodness in the future, she\u2019ll stick around.\n\nOr maybe the people in Carlos\u2019 private classes became super annoying as a result of the \u201chooks\u201d in Carlos\u2019 books.  That\u2019s my biggest fear, that Carlos did this to us on purpose.\n\nWhat are the hooks?  Super powers for starters. We have the Fire Kasina lecture where he states that the Buddha himself did in fact advertise super powers early on.\n\nOf course he did. The Christians also advertise super powers.  So do the Jews.  And everyone else. Super powers sell religions.\n\nI haven\u2019t a problem with that.  I guess I have my own annoying tendencies which I\u2019m not willing to give up.\n\nSuper powers = good.\n\nBut what are the other hooks in there, designed to convince you to give up normal life, and chase something nonsensical (literally).\n\nIt\u2019s that \u201cwarrior\u201d thing.  What could be more annoying than someone running around with a picture in their own mind, of their noble endeavors against the evils of the world?\n\nThey\u2019re \u201cimpeccable\u201d, meaning, better than the people they are trying to escape.\n\nAnd they erase personal history, so as to leave no trace for the evil commoners to find.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough, they have a super arch enemy villain to fall in love with.  A big sloppy mud colored blob that gives their toes little kisses, to show how important they are.  As a \u201cwarrior\u201d, their goal is to deny the blob those kisses, since the blob didn't have permission.  I guess it's a second attention me-too movement.\n\nAll of this might be fine for socially minded people.  Namely, stalkers.  They can work with any nonsense.  I personally don\u2019t like the division between dreamer and stalker anymore than I like the other pretentious stuff Carlos added to his books, but that category does seem to be true.\n\nOtherwise, for the dreamers, I propose we stop being \u201cwarriors\u201d.\n\nHow about \u201cStormtroopers\u201d, continuing with the Yoda and Star Wars theme that seems to have sucked up Carlos\u2019 books?\n\nStorm Troopers stumble in with maximum force, propelled by orders from a higher intelligence.  They do their best, but after the battle they stumble back home, get drunk, and go find some prostitutes.\nOr television reruns, if they have that in the Star Wars universe.  Come to think of it, I never saw any hookers in there too.\n\nJust because they like to have some fun, stromtroopers aren't any less effective than \u201cWarriors\u201d.  It\u2019s no good coming home from battle to celebrate, if you have too many self-conscious rules piled on top of your voluntary behavior.\n\nStorm Troopers are not noble. They\u2019re a dime a dozen.  If some fail, more will come along.  In the end, the battle is all that matters.  Not the people.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason for a Stromtrooper to have a \u201cbook deal\u201d.  Who\u2019d read it?  Certainly not another storm trooper.\nBut what about impeccability?\n\nForget it.  It\u2019s just a mental image that\u2019ll hold you back.  I'm not impeccable. I'm greedy.\n\nAnd being greedy for the second attention, my interests just happen to coincide with those of impeccable people, most of the time.  It\u2019s just an unhappy coincidence.\n\nWith that weird attitude of impeccability removed from your mind, a 10-pound weight will be lifted and you\u2019ll be slightly less annoying.\n\nCan we still erase personal history without being flakey?\n\nIn as far as it helps keep you from obsessing over social situations, which prevents assembling other worlds, then erase away.\n\nBut can\u2019t it be just another unhappy coincidence, and not a cult charter you have to sign up for?\nWe avoid social strife after utilizing it for any understanding it can provide.  We don\u2019t erase it.\nThe problem with cult charters is, you forget the promises of the cult, and become involved in figuring out whether you measure up to their standards.  You ignore pursuing the super powers, and instead purse social grace in the eyes of the cult.\n\nPursuing social graces turns you into social police. There's plenty of that going on in the world of sorcery.\nThe obsession over social status causes you to put off actually doing any work.   It\u2019s very difficult to find even a tiny cubic centimeter of the kind of effort or mental drive needed to practice something so stupid as not-thinking and not-doing.  And the bad news is, you need more like a cubic yard of effort, to make any progress.\nIn Carlos\u2019 classes, I was about as annoying as it got. Carlos even had to tell me on a couple of occasions, \"That's too far.\"\n\nI\u2019d like to be less annoying, but mostly because the kind of annoying you got in Carlos' classes prevents exploring perception.  You have to get rid of that first.  Carlos gave up on trying to remove it. Even telling us to stop reading the books of Carlos Castaneda, didn't help.\n\nSo, when someone asks if I\u2019m a \u201cwarrior\u201d, I\u2019m going to say, \u201cI\u2019m more like a Storm Trooper, especially the kind who goes home and gets drunk after each battle.\n\nI\u2019m also not impeccable. But my interests happen to coincide with those described in Carlos\u2019 books, for people who believe themselves to be impeccable. And as far as I can, I try to avoid hanging out with impeccable people. They're too much trouble.\n\nAs for erasing personal history, that always creates a new one.   Better to recapitulate enough to be somewhat airy, and closer to immune to social turmoil.  If there\u2019s nothing for those foreign emanations to get stuck in, you\u2019re better off than if you hide from them.\n\nHow about celibacy?  Don\u2019t be celibate.  Just keep in mind the outcomes that sex produces, and consider whether any are actually worth pursuing. I suspect you\u2019ll find they\u2019re not.\n\nIn the end, I think we\u2019re all better off as disenchanted stormtroopers.  I suspect that the idea of being a warrior was added by Carlos or don Juan, merely to hook our gigantic egos.  I bet they chuckled as they planned it out.\n\nThey even threw in a magical dog!\n\nAnd don't forget what hooked Carol Tiggs on first meeting don Juan.  It's in lecture notes posted in the last few months.\n\nHe burped loudly. \n\nMaybe he knew his target audiences well.\n\nEdited: once", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Let's be Stormtroopers", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_c7vj6g", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1562003562.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1561999822.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning:  contrary post.

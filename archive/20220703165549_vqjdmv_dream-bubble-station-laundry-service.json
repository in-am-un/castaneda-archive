There's no \"theories\", \"beliefs\", and especially no \"sacred scrolls\".\n\nIt's not pretend!  Sacred scrolls are only for profiteering.\n\nWe just DO what we say we do.  At first it seems the same as other systems because you haven't actually developed any sorcery skills.\n\nBut later, you are literally inside full on waking dreams, playing in the dream as if you had gone to sleep and become lucid for a few minutes.\n\nExcept, you're awake!\n\nIt's just that the room is dark, so your dream visions can be seen.  Fully!\n\nAnd you can stay in them, for hours.  It's not \"hit or miss\" like 4 gates dreaming. It's reliable!\n\nJust a while ago I found Cholita's little squirrel sneaking across the floor, looking for scraps like a puppy.  It was \"Minx\", her ally.  It even let me touch it's fur and show some affection.\n\nIt made me wonder if Cholita doesn't cuddle with Minx at night too, the way Taisha does with Phoebus and Globus.\n\nSo for a beginner all this sounds crazy, but the difference in this subreddit is that there are instructions which work, so you can duplicate the \"craziness\" yourself.\n\nIf you join something like Dzogchen, it'll be pointless talking and promises never fulfilled.  No one gets magic using Buddhism! At best, they get some green line effects on that J curve map and then confuse themselves.  Something you could do with shamanic drumming, minus the delusions of being a \"master\".\n\nOnce you can move your assemblage point far enough to alter reality itself, you can decide at that point what's \"real\", and what's not.  But first, see it for yourself!\n\nThen decide \"how you feel about it\".\n\nMyself, I don't care. If you can perceive it while sober and wide awake, then it's \"real\".\n\nLet's start with a primer on \"dreaming attention\".\n\nBecause I'm going to tell you how to activate it full force, using Tensegrity.\n\nDreaming attention is said by the witches to only come from sexual energy.\n\nIt's a gloomy prospect I suppose since the \"River of Shit\", the social customs we live in, are seemingly motivated only by human reproductive cycles.\n\nThe idea of giving up sex seems horrible.\n\nBut don't worry, you don't need to.  You have enough energy to activate waking dreaming even without being celibate.\n\nYou just switch to our \"secondary sentience\".\n\nNamely muscle memory.\n\nMuscle  memory is as aware of what's going on, as your conscious mind is.\n\nIt's what reaches your hand out at lightening speed, to catch a glass falling from the dinner table before your normal conscious awareness can even realize it's falling.\n\nTensegrity activates that by the very act of moving precisely, while following the \"theme\" of the tensegrity move.\n\nThe passes come with \"stories\".\n\nMy favorite?  \"Let's give our energy body a big hug!\"\n\nThe affection for the energy body pass.\n\nSome story there!\n\nAnd you can.  Hug it.  Trust me.  At advanced levels he's fully visible during the whole pass, swirling around as puffs of dreams in the air, each one a body part you \"slap into place\" using the movements.\n\nAt the end you can pull aside the bushes to a visible \"jungle\", and find him standing there.\n\nSo you can hug him.\n\nLiterally!\n\nWe don't \"visualize\" things. What you see should be visual, and even a surprise.\n\nJust like lucid dreaming.  If you've become lucid in a dream and looked deliberately at the objects, you know the surprise and feeling of energy you get.  It's so real!!!  People exclaim that the next day.\n\nWaking dreaming is even more so!\n\nBut back to dreaming energy.\n\nWhen we have sex we ignore reality, and try to create the ultimate dream fantasy sex partner.\n\nCouples are especially aware that it's actually a dream, and they plan \"romantic getaways\" to get into the mood.\n\nBut I suppose the best example of the fact that sex is a dream, is the classic case of the teenage male who signs up for the Navy, and on his departing visit to his girlfriend vows to love her forever, and gets her pregnant.\n\nThen a few months later you hear that he dumped her for a woman tending bar at a port where his ship often parks.\n\nBoth sex partners were 100% sincere when he was going off to war, but the truth is that situation is easy to see through and is one of the well known \"classic teenage mistakes\".\n\nThey used up dreaming awareness that night, making it all seem very real when it was obviously not.\n\nThat facilitates transfer of awareness into the baby.  The opposite is the \"bored fuck\" situation, where both parents are bored during sex, and the resulting child has very little energy.\n\nAnd sorcery will be much harder for that child.  He'll have to be celibate.\n\nOr cheat.  Use Tensegrity to switch to our \"secondary sentience\".  Muscle memory.\n\nNow assuming that you've saved up some of this dreaming attention, it turns out that we burn it off all day long, with our internal dialogue.\n\nIt fantasizes all day about grievances, worries, past mistakes, past fun, fantasy wishes.\n\nIn our minds, we're creating endless mini-dream scenarios.\n\nThat's our dreaming awareness being used to examine \"what if\" during our daily world.\n\nIn the darkroom, you have to shut that off.    The internal dialogue.\n\nYou can't get out of it.  You can't \"do something else\".  Pursue another path, like 4 gates dreaming.\n\nThat's just not going to work for you.  In fact, 4 gates dreaming can't work at all past the 1st gate, until you can move your assemblage point very far.   And that only happens if you learn silence.\n\nYou may be asleep, but you can't visit the IOB world and learn from the dreaming emissary, until your assemblage point can reach the red zone on the J curve.\n\nIt has to be loosened up from the blue zone, or you won't get past the 1st gate.  Which is where \"lucid dreamers\" are stuck.\n\nSo gazing into the darkness, without your internal dialogue burning off your dreaming attention, you can now focus your dreaming energy on manifesting things.   Entire dream objects and scenes.\n\nToo difficult?  Yes, for you.\n\nBut not for your dream double.  The guy who runs around in dreams.\n\nIt's a cinch for him!\n\nWe just need to lure him to come help.  He can sort of \"hang out\" with us like an iron man suit.  Surround us with \"heads up displays\" right in front of our noses.\n\nThe tensegrity sets that up.\n\nThat's why darkroom emphasizes \"visible tensegrity\".\n\nThat really just means, \"dreaming tensegrity\".\n\nOr, \"dream double assisted vision\".\n\nBut this is about a laundry service, so I'd better skip to the end.\n\nIf you \"turbo charge\" your tensegrity, you will find you are moving dreaming scenes around in the air.   While doing the moves.\n\nAlong with puffs of colors, swirls of blackness, and even sensations and flashes.  There are also other possible realties mixed in.\n\nYou get there by looking for it.  Not by finding a single puff once in a while, and scooping it up.\n\nBut by doing that until you can perceive the puffs of your energy body all the time, like a fog in the air.\n\nDon't forget to scoop puffs onto your \"pouches\".  We need that energy body to \"behave\" and come closer. And don't forget to charge up the \"V spot\". That's your \"will\".\n\nAnd then, using that saved up dreaming attention which you aren't burning off with  your internal dialogue forcing you to visualize unrelated problems, you can cause that dreaming fog to \"take shape\".\n\nSoon, if you do it well, your muscle memory takes over and \"learns the layout\" of the tensegrity pass, as if it were a real structure.\n\nThe same way perhaps that your leg learns not to get into that horribly cramped car from the wrong direction, or your shin smashes against the door on the way in and it hurts like hell.\n\nYour muscle memory can also learn the \"dream\" that a tensegrity move has evolved to generate.\n\nEach one capable of a unique dream, fully visible, with a \"theme\".\n\nAnd if you do that well, at the end of the tensegrity pass you will literally be in a phantom realm in full on Silent Knowledge.\n\nBecause the intensity of the tensegrity, fully inside a visible dream, moved  your assemblage point all the way to the end of the J curve.\n\nAt that point you might even end up with some visitors, like my  storyteller.  Or the caretaker of the vast underground transportation network.\n\nI even have a witch of the tunnel now, of unknown origin.\n\nKeep in mind, \"Silent Knowledge Entities\" don't have an actual life.  They are generated by the interplay of the emanations in man's band of awareness.  You simply develop  the ability to perceive that, when the assemblage point reaches the end of the J curve.\n\nBUT, anyone's double can take over an SKE.\n\nSo you can never really tell what you are dealing with.\n\nTonight my \"witch of the tunnel\" decided to stroll across my darkroom, and as she did she left \"ripples\" of ultra real reality, which adjusted the focus and details in my Dream Bubble Station, making me realize that if you want it real you just need to accept and \"feel\" that, so that your dreaming attention is free to focus on any details you want to bring out.\n\nThat attention we burn off with our internal dialogue becomes ours to reuse,  once we remove that talking monstrosity.\n\nAnd if you have developed the \"feeling\" of being in a phantom room, then anywhere you look brings out the details.\n\nIt wasn't the witch walking which created the dream ripples.\n\nIt was me watching her walk.\n\nMy pure dream awareness, available because of silence, made where she walked \"real\".\n\nIt occurred to me that the best way to make a phantom realm more real, is to \"use it\" like it was real.\n\nI guess when I watched my witch walk across the room, I was sort of \"girl watching\".\n\nA very real activity for men.\n\nSo I decided to try \"doing the laundry\".\n\nA long time ago, far before last night,  I left some shirts on my bed because I was too lazy to hang them up.\n\nWhen it came time for darkroom they were in the way on the end of the bed.\n\nI was playing with my Ally \"Fancy\", and realized she was interested in the laundry.\n\nCan't recall why.  Maybe because I couldn't sit there when needed.\n\nSo I started to hang the shirts in the closet, despite it being pitch black, and found Fancy had put on one of the shirts.\n\nI was holding it up to put the hanger in, and there was a beautiful woman wearing it.\n\nKind of busty by the way...\n\nIt became a game we played.\n\nSo tonight, to make dream bubble station \"more real\" with some \"real activity\", I declared it had a laundry service.\n\nIt was already quite visible, as phantom rooms go.\n\nBut it's a cave like structure, being a \"station\" in a 100,000 old transportation network, created by ancient humans.\n\nOutside the \"station\" proper, it's cave like.  Made of hard rock or dirt.\n\nWhen I decided a laundry service existed, closet walls materialized on the cave surface.\n\nI had a \"dream closet\" in which to hang clothes.\n\nFancy showed up as soon as I hung the first shirt up.\n\nLike a dog who hears the can opener.\n\nI hung a few shirts with her, suspicious of what might happen next.\n\nI never played that game with her in a phantom room. The first time we played that game, I was merely feeling around in the dark for the closet, the hangers, and the shirts on the bed.  And Fancy was the only visible dreaming object.\n\nWhen she \"wore\" a shirt, then the shirt was visible as I held it up.  Otherwise it was just darkness.\n\nBut this time I was hanging the shirts in a phantom closet, on the wall of a phantom realm 100,000 years old.\n\nIt was a real place, and I was doing real activity there to make it even more real.\n\nSo naturally, Fancy became real.\n\nI had a visitor to Bubble Station.\n\nNow, don't get mad.\n\nDon't read this, and be unhappy at how much work it will take to get this far.\n\nGet even!\n\nDo it yourself.\n\nIt starts with realizing that the tensegrity forms are ALL mini-dreams.  Phantom rooms.  Stories.\n\nThey aren't \"chi gung\" which is pretended to be simply  \"good for you\", but otherwise produces no visible results.\n\nWhen done in perfect silence, and knowing that you want your muscle memory to take over your perception of the darkness as you do the moves, you will end up in dreaming.\n\nAt first just puffs, streaks, sparkles.\n\nBut the puffs will contain tiny dreams, those will spread out, and you'll be doing tensegrity inside a ball of magical visions.\n\nWhen the form is done, you're inside a full on waking dream.\n\nAnd then, ultimately, you can test the limits of this.\n\nNarrate a story to fit your phantom room.\n\nControl the flow of a completely visible dream, using your words.\n\nThat's what it means when don Juan says that \"Sorcerer's are Storytellers\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Dream Bubble Station Laundry Service", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Games"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"cavqgvoqzd991": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cavqgvoqzd991.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8be3750afa86d900a35e8a3715b41469f702e585"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cavqgvoqzd991.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=618330f8bfb9ad52ef8afc98cb1301d1b2194611"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cavqgvoqzd991.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6ca3d383ee28677e9dbd562d0a4a7e4ab121b80"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cavqgvoqzd991.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8de626114d1da7a184b0de70115af925231de6df"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cavqgvoqzd991.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b36612a06abe453b8c744b6e96b77443f9e09925"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cavqgvoqzd991.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77ea06ee2d8f9ebd8bd8c35c32606567381ad4cf"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cavqgvoqzd991.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41c246acab1b697f0ace37cdf39bf0f1b88b8415"}, "id": "cavqgvoqzd991"}}, "name": "t3_vqjdmv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Games", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/2SlDMas1vETqTQu1GSgUmBc8UaimNSbPXpeY0vqxtrk.jpg", "edited": 1656870755.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1656860149.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cavqgvoqzd991.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=41c246acab1b697f0ace37cdf39bf0f1b88b8415\"&gt;Mostly recycled older pics.

The internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t get out of it.  You can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;do something else&amp;quot;.  Pursue another path, like 4 gates dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just not going to work for you.  In fact, 4 gates dreaming can&amp;#39;t work at all past the 1st gate, until you can move your assemblage point very far.   And that only happens if you learn silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may be asleep, but you can&amp;#39;t visit the IOB world and learn from the dreaming emissary, until your assemblage point can reach the red zone on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has to be loosened up from the blue zone, or you won&amp;#39;t get past the 1st gate.  Which is where &amp;quot;lucid dreamers&amp;quot; are stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So gazing into the darkness, without your internal dialogue burning off your dreaming attention, you can now focus your dreaming energy on manifesting things.   Entire dream objects and scenes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too difficult?  Yes, for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not for your dream double.  The guy who runs around in dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a cinch for him!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just need to lure him to come help.  He can sort of &amp;quot;hang out&amp;quot; with us like an iron man suit.  Surround us with &amp;quot;heads up displays&amp;quot; right in front of our noses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity sets that up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why darkroom emphasizes &amp;quot;visible tensegrity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That really just means, &amp;quot;dreaming tensegrity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, &amp;quot;dream double assisted vision&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this is about a laundry service, so I&amp;#39;d better skip to the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you &amp;quot;turbo charge&amp;quot; your tensegrity, you will find you are moving dreaming scenes around in the air.   While doing the moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along with puffs of colors, swirls of blackness, and even sensations and flashes.  There are also other possible realties mixed in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get there by looking for it.  Not by finding a single puff once in a while, and scooping it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But by doing that until you can perceive the puffs of your energy body all the time, like a fog in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget to scoop puffs onto your &amp;quot;pouches&amp;quot;.  We need that energy body to &amp;quot;behave&amp;quot; and come closer. And don&amp;#39;t forget to charge up the &amp;quot;V spot&amp;quot;. That&amp;#39;s your &amp;quot;will&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, using that saved up dreaming attention which you aren&amp;#39;t burning off with  your internal dialogue forcing you to visualize unrelated problems, you can cause that dreaming fog to &amp;quot;take shape&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soon, if you do it well, your muscle memory takes over and &amp;quot;learns the layout&amp;quot; of the tensegrity pass, as if it were a real structure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same way perhaps that your leg learns not to get into that horribly cramped car from the wrong direction, or your shin smashes against the door on the way in and it hurts like hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your muscle memory can also learn the &amp;quot;dream&amp;quot; that a tensegrity move has evolved to generate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each one capable of a unique dream, fully visible, with a &amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you do that well, at the end of the tensegrity pass you will literally be in a phantom realm in full on Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the intensity of the tensegrity, fully inside a visible dream, moved  your assemblage point all the way to the end of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point you might even end up with some visitors, like my  storyteller.  Or the caretaker of the vast underground transportation network.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even have a witch of the tunnel now, of unknown origin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge Entities&amp;quot; don&amp;#39;t have an actual life.  They are generated by the interplay of the emanations in man&amp;#39;s band of awareness.  You simply develop  the ability to perceive that, when the assemblage point reaches the end of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, anyone&amp;#39;s double can take over an SKE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can never really tell what you are dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tonight my &amp;quot;witch of the tunnel&amp;quot; decided to stroll across my darkroom, and as she did she left &amp;quot;ripples&amp;quot; of ultra real reality, which adjusted the focus and details in my Dream Bubble Station, making me realize that if you want it real you just need to accept and &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; that, so that your dreaming attention is free to focus on any details you want to bring out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That attention we burn off with our internal dialogue becomes ours to reuse,  once we remove that talking monstrosity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you have developed the &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; of being in a phantom room, then anywhere you look brings out the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t the witch walking which created the dream ripples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was me watching her walk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My pure dream awareness, available because of silence, made where she walked &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that the best way to make a phantom realm more real, is to &amp;quot;use it&amp;quot; like it was real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess when I watched my witch walk across the room, I was sort of &amp;quot;girl watching&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very real activity for men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I decided to try &amp;quot;doing the laundry&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, far before last night,  I left some shirts on my bed because I was too lazy to hang them up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it came time for darkroom they were in the way on the end of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was playing with my Ally &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot;, and realized she was interested in the laundry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t recall why.  Maybe because I couldn&amp;#39;t sit there when needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I started to hang the shirts in the closet, despite it being pitch black, and found Fancy had put on one of the shirts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was holding it up to put the hanger in, and there was a beautiful woman wearing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of busty by the way...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It became a game we played.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So tonight, to make dream bubble station &amp;quot;more real&amp;quot; with some &amp;quot;real activity&amp;quot;, I declared it had a laundry service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was already quite visible, as phantom rooms go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s a cave like structure, being a &amp;quot;station&amp;quot; in a 100,000 old transportation network, created by ancient humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside the &amp;quot;station&amp;quot; proper, it&amp;#39;s cave like.  Made of hard rock or dirt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I decided a laundry service existed, closet walls materialized on the cave surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a &amp;quot;dream closet&amp;quot; in which to hang clothes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy showed up as soon as I hung the first shirt up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a dog who hears the can opener.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hung a few shirts with her, suspicious of what might happen next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never played that game with her in a phantom room. The first time we played that game, I was merely feeling around in the dark for the closet, the hangers, and the shirts on the bed.  And Fancy was the only visible dreaming object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she &amp;quot;wore&amp;quot; a shirt, then the shirt was visible as I held it up.  Otherwise it was just darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this time I was hanging the shirts in a phantom closet, on the wall of a phantom realm 100,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a real place, and I was doing real activity there to make it even more real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So naturally, Fancy became real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a visitor to Bubble Station.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, don&amp;#39;t get mad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t read this, and be unhappy at how much work it will take to get this far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get even!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It starts with realizing that the tensegrity forms are ALL mini-dreams.  Phantom rooms.  Stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;chi gung&amp;quot; which is pretended to be simply  &amp;quot;good for you&amp;quot;, but otherwise produces no visible results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When done in perfect silence, and knowing that you want your muscle memory to take over your perception of the darkness as you do the moves, you will end up in dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first just puffs, streaks, sparkles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the puffs will contain tiny dreams, those will spread out, and you&amp;#39;ll be doing tensegrity inside a ball of magical visions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the form is done, you&amp;#39;re inside a full on waking dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, ultimately, you can test the limits of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Narrate a story to fit your phantom room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Control the flow of a completely visible dream, using your words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what it means when don Juan says that &amp;quot;Sorcerer&amp;#39;s are Storytellers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null,

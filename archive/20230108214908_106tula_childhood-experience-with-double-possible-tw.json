Those are your double in its raw form.\n\nIn the middle is \"you\", which can be visibly seen during darkroom practice, often as a yellowish energy skeleton.\n\nBut it will also make yellow puffs on occasion.\n\nThose normally reside in your internal organs.\n\nWhich you can also visibly see!  \n\nThere's no \"sacred scrolls\" in sorcery.\n\nYou get to do it ALL!\n\nSo we have no one to \"worship\".\n\nThere's no \"Buddha\" lording it over everyone.\n\nIn fact, we might easily exceed our teachers. Become more powerful than both Carlos and don Juan!\n\nThat's what happens in REAL magical systems. They evolve to be even more powerful.\n\nThose purple puffs normally stay on the outside, where you see the darker purple \"crusted\" up against the edge of the egg.\n\nExcept in children they're all still free and \"floaty\".\n\nWhen one of those puffs of purple touches the yellowish ones belonging to your normal consciousness,  in the center, it picks up the \"feelings\".\n\nCan't help it! They actually mix, and stick together.\n\nWhich you can also visibly see.   You can scoop up one of those purple puffs with your hand, then place the other hand under, palm up, and slide out the bottom.\n\nTo reveal some yellow energy has stuck there.\n\nSo the purple has to be \"very good friends\" with the yellow puffs, because if they get close to each other they \"swap spit\".\n\nTo use a disgusting analogy.\n\nAnd in normal people they're \"enemies\".\n\nBecause the purple puffs don't like that horrible \"poor me...  I get such a raw deal in life.  How can people treat ME, like this???!!\"\n\nWe're overflowing with that sentiment, because of the position of our assemblage points.\n\nNot because we're \"bad people\", or \"cursed by God\".\n\nIt's just the times we live in.  \n\nSo to learn sorcery, we shut off that  yapping voice in our head and use darkness to try to visibly see those purple puffs.\n\nIt's what we do in here.\n\nAfter a while the purple puffs flow freely inside that egg, and you can play with them.\n\nBut not until you \"fix yourself\", so that you don't stink so badly.\n\nThe purple won't come off the walls until you do.\n\nThen one day, if you work hard, that purple stuff forms a \"vehicle\" for you.\n\nA \"blue ball of energy\".\n\nBut it looks like you get swarmed by intense blue swirls. The purple changes to blue when it \"offers\" you to come inside and travel in your energy body.\n\nWhich can switch to the double at the drop of a hat.\n\nBut you'll also get to visibly see your double often practicing darkroom, and even \"merge\" with him to receive \"silent knowledge\".  That's what \"seeing\" is.  When your eyes have merged with the double's eyes, so that you have access to anything ever known.\n\nSmall children \"sleep walk\" because they switch to their double while asleep, and get up to explore.\n\nI used to notice I was sleepwalking, decide it was really cool, so I went back to being unconscious.\n\nBut tried really hard to perceive what I was doing while walking around asleep.\n\nNever could do both. Be conscious, and sleep walk at the same time.\n\nNow keep in mind. \n\n NOTHING you can learn in this subreddit does anyone any good.\n\nNor does anything you will read in those books.\n\nThey're supposed to motivate you to try what they instruct.\n\nBut the \"facts\" do nobody any good at all.\n\nAnd yet, there are endless bad men running around pretending that knowing the facts from those books, makes them a sorcerer.\n\nSome weird ego trip where they only care what others think, and don't actually believe magic is possible.\n\nOr are too lazy to try to get the real thing.\n\nSo it's a waste of your time to just read the books, if you don't follow the instructions they give you.\n\nAnd the first 4 books don't have those instructions.  Except to learn not to talk to yourself in your head.\n\nThe rest is just about the \"men of knowledge\", and you DO NOT WANT to be one of those idiots.\n\nThey were greedy profiteers who never learned to be a seer, because there wasn't any profit in it.\n\nThose gave rise to ALL shamanism in Mexico and the USA.\n\nSo \"native american shamans\" are also idiots for the most part.\n\nAnd they hate Carlos.\n\nAnd would become very angry if they saw what's in this subreddit.\n\nBecause in fact, they can't do it.\n\nJust FYI.\n\nCertainly \"shamanism\" is a lot better than any other religion.\n\nBut it's not what we do in here.\n\nFirst 4 books?\n\nNonsense.\n\nRemaining books?\n\nNo one ever follows instructions.\n\nSo no one learned in the last 50 years.\n\nThe spirits Little Smoke and Devil's weed created this subreddit after Carlos released them to us.  Probably as an emergency measure, in case all of his human students faile.\n\nWhich they did.\n\nLittle Smoke and Devil's Weed allies got tired of humans messing things up.\n\nSo they created this place.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j3j46w8", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children run into their double all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason adults don&amp;#39;t is because they&amp;#39;ve developed that ugly internal dialogue filled with self-pity and grief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double is puffs of energy inside your egg, sharing the container with your &amp;quot;tonal awareness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/n4curyzysxaa1.png?width=728&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=29e16869595a2da2934f23af921fe1b7f1799472\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/n4curyzysxaa1.png?width=728&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=29e16869595a2da2934f23af921fe1b7f1799472&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See the violet &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot;?

Just before you pass out, scoop some of that yellow stuff into your hand and sit back down before you fall over.\n\nYou now have a lantern in your hand!\n\nUse it to illuminate your dark room.\n\nNaturally you already need to be a skilled translocator to pull it off like this pic, but it turns out to be repeatable.\n\nYou probably can't repeat WHAT you translocated, but if you have energy you can cause SOMETHING to appear.\n\nA few of you can already do that on demand.\n\nThe problem is, it takes so long to get to the end of the orange zone.\n\nThat's where the whitish light appears, and then if you concentrate your very best on silence, you start to \"know\" things.

Well, no big deal.  You've seen caves before.\n\nYou go back to what you were doing, like caves aren't worth anything, until you remember  you'd give anything to have a cave in your room, during normal hours.\n\nYou really ought to at least take a closer look.\n\nAnd you do.  But halfway through \"looking\" at the cave, you run out of energy.  You can feel it! It's like a mild sinus headache.\n\nIt's over for the night, unless you want to \"recharge\".\n\nA very slow process.\n\nSo what can you do?\n\nYou need to make caves faster!  That's all.\n\nSo use that lantern you scooped up, and slowly move it across the room, turning in a circle while standing, and look past the glow in your hand, without staring at it.\n\nSee if it doesn't uncover a translocation.\n\nI predict, your translocations will be much simpler than the ones that are a product of \"free energy\".\n\nThe ones that come by themselves, are perhaps at least a tiny bit \"real\".

If it's wrong in part, big deal!  The good thing about being us is, there's no qualified meditation police.\n\nFirst part ought to have been obvious.\n\nBabies perceive the abstract!\n\nDuh...   No language, no internal dialogue.  They're swimming in it!\n\nSecond part is the encouraging part.\n\nEncouraging because darkroom is really hard!  Even if you do very well (meaning you actually put in the effort), you still have to fight your way back to the end of the J curve each night.\n\nI can't think of any other activity that's like that, except possibly trying to get along with Cholita.  Doesn't matter how much effort you put into that, or how much progress you make, the next day none of it matters.\n\nDarkroom feels like that at times, especially when you're trying to do the super cool stuff that requires deep orange zone.\n\nBut the abstract is not like that.\n\nOnce you clearly see what it is like, you only need 20 minutes of that.\n\nAnd your mind re-accepts it.  Maybe because babies see it all the time.\n\nCould even be as low as 5 minutes of perceiving it.\n\nNo more than 30.\n\nHow long you retain it I don't know, but it's nice that it even lasts a full day.\n\nWhat's it like?\n\nI have a feeling the abstract is sort of like drawing straws to decide who gets to go on the suicide mission.\n\nThe straws are different lengths.\n\nRight now I only see the stubby pieces of the abstract.  The longer straws might reach so far, that they're even able to do stuff we can't understand at all.  But the shorter ones are managable as feelings.\n\nThose are a tiny bit like the fortune in a fortune cookie.\n\nJust a one liner, and it's over.  The one liner has meaning, but there's no reason to dwell on it.\n\nThe abstract is like an avaiable flow of those, except take the words out of the 1 liner, and leave only the meaning,  or the \"point\", and then make the meaning so symbolic you really couldn't describe it.\n\nBut you feel it.\n\nA baby is surrounded by that. It's like cozy warm bath water and you're laying in it.  Minus the having to get out later and freeze part.\n\nIt's somehow cozy, which is nice because being outside the river of filth, is supposed to be just cold enough that people return to the river.  They need that cozy feeling..\n\nThe abstract is certainly cozy.  Blissful even, except the bliss is fundmentally deeper than the green zone kind.\n\nOnce you accept the abstract, and here's the one I'm afraid to mention, the energy body's finest details become visible.\n\nI mean, you look down, there they are.\n\nI'm lucky to have seen them before, whenever Cholita decided to please me.\n\nThe sight back then seemed a bit dangerous, like dying.\n\nNow, it just \"is\".  And it comes with a weird, \"isness\" feeling.  If you can heear insects communicating at high pitches all night, like a background noise, its a tiny bit like that.  Usually you ignore the bugs, but if the room is silent and it's a calm night, they're present almost like a steady sound of wind (but obviously super high pitched and not strong individually).\n\nAccepting the abstract brings out the super fine details of the energy body.  Fibers, what looks to be bumps, and odd flows you can't describe.\n\nThe bumps are too big, so you only get the silouette.\n\nBut the fine lines are complete, and they even move at normal speeds, flowing around.\n\nGiven that view, the jet plane aspect of using the energy body doesn't seem as hard to believe.\n\nI do find it hard to believe however, that you can bring anything along.\n\nMeaning, Elias might have worked in the north, while living in the south, but I doubt he brought his doctor's bag long with him.\n\nI hope I'm wrong about that.\n\nClothes?\n\nI've seen Cholita's double do costume changes in seconds, so clothes aren't an issue in the double.\n\nNext, there's some odd connection between the abstract and cyclic beings.\n\nI have no idea what it is, but it made me realize, when people wonder whats the deal with Carol and the death defier, they forget that they're cyclic.  And when you switch to a cyclic being, you body snatch it.\n\nThere isn't two of that person, and one hides or gets absorbed when it doesn't want to be around.\n\nThey're merged.\n\nI suppose they can unmerge too, but they don't have to.\n\nI have no idea who dominates. Or even if one influences the other much.\n\nI've seen the abstract in the past, so don't anyone get too excited if you perceive it a tiny bit.\n\nYou need to go back to swimming in it, to restore it.\n\nOr maybe, it's like you have to perceive it continuously, then doubt that, then perceive it and realize it's there, but you can't find even a single word to describe it, so if it's not the same abstract sorcerers are talking about, it doesn't matter because there's nothing else you could possibly call it.\n\nPerceiving the abstract continuously is like noticing background sound.  Or maybe, like notcing you can actually feel the skin on your knee if you search for it.\n\nThere's no value, but it's always feelable.\n\nSo is the abstract.\n\nWhich means, as you are feeling the smaller pieces of it, it's a continuous flow of \"knowing\".\n\nYou accept just knowing things.\n\nIt's not quite the same as seeing.   The whitish light lets you see, very easily.  Continuously.\n\nBut that's almost annoying.  You get tired if you continuously see.\n\nNot with the abstract.  It saves enery because you just know, and can't stand a chance to try to understand why.  So you don't use up emotional energy for that aspect.\n\nThe knowing part is odd.  It's like you *know* you are safe. Nothing can happen to you.\n\nNot to say that's actually true.\n\nBut it could be why don Juan mentions, in the face of certain death, just accept it.\n\nThat would let you perceive the abstract aspect of the process, which might leave an escape route.", "edited": 1638091997.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hmdsoks", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to go out on  a limb here  and discuss &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe what I&amp;#39;m saying is wrong in any part, but the understanding might be so simplistic, that it&amp;#39;s close enough (to wrong).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I believe it&amp;#39;s encouraging, so good to post.  If it&amp;#39;s wrong in part, big deal!  The good thing about being us is, there&amp;#39;s no qualified meditation police.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First part ought to have been obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Babies perceive the abstract!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Duh...   No language, no internal dialogue.  They&amp;#39;re swimming in it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second part is the encouraging part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Encouraging because darkroom is really hard!  Even if you do very well (meaning you actually put in the effort), you still have to fight your way back to the end of the J curve each night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t think of any other activity that&amp;#39;s like that, except possibly trying to get along with Cholita.  Doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much effort you put into that, or how much progress you make, the next day none of it matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darkroom feels like that at times, especially when you&amp;#39;re trying to do the super cool stuff that requires deep orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the abstract is not like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you clearly see what it is like, you only need 20 minutes of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And your mind re-accepts it.  Maybe because babies see it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could even be as low as 5 minutes of perceiving it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No more than 30.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How long you retain it I don&amp;#39;t know, but it&amp;#39;s nice that it even lasts a full day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s it like?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling the abstract is sort of like drawing straws to decide who gets to go on the suicide mission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The straws are different lengths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now I only see the stubby pieces of the abstract.  The longer straws might reach so far, that they&amp;#39;re even able to do stuff we can&amp;#39;t understand at all.  But the shorter ones are managable as feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are a tiny bit like the fortune in a fortune cookie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a one liner, and it&amp;#39;s over.  The one liner has meaning, but there&amp;#39;s no reason to dwell on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The abstract is like an avaiable flow of those, except take the words out of the 1 liner, and leave only the meaning,  or the &amp;quot;point&amp;quot;, and then make the meaning so symbolic you really couldn&amp;#39;t describe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you feel it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A baby is surrounded by that. It&amp;#39;s like cozy warm bath water and you&amp;#39;re laying in it.  Minus the having to get out later and freeze part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s somehow cozy, which is nice because being outside the river of filth, is supposed to be just cold enough that people return to the river.  They need that cozy feeling..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The abstract is certainly cozy.  Blissful even, except the bliss is fundmentally deeper than the green zone kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you accept the abstract, and here&amp;#39;s the one I&amp;#39;m afraid to mention, the energy body&amp;#39;s finest details become visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, you look down, there they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m lucky to have seen them before, whenever Cholita decided to please me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sight back then seemed a bit dangerous, like dying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, it just &amp;quot;is&amp;quot;.  And it comes with a weird, &amp;quot;isness&amp;quot; feeling.  If you can heear insects communicating at high pitches all night, like a background noise, its a tiny bit like that.  Usually you ignore the bugs, but if the room is silent and it&amp;#39;s a calm night, they&amp;#39;re present almost like a steady sound of wind (but obviously super high pitched and not strong individually).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Accepting the abstract brings out the super fine details of the energy body.  Fibers, what looks to be bumps, and odd flows you can&amp;#39;t describe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bumps are too big, so you only get the silouette.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the fine lines are complete, and they even move at normal speeds, flowing around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given that view, the jet plane aspect of using the energy body doesn&amp;#39;t seem as hard to believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do find it hard to believe however, that you can bring anything along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, Elias might have worked in the north, while living in the south, but I doubt he brought his doctor&amp;#39;s bag long with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope I&amp;#39;m wrong about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clothes?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen Cholita&amp;#39;s double do costume changes in seconds, so clothes aren&amp;#39;t an issue in the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, there&amp;#39;s some odd connection between the abstract and cyclic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what it is, but it made me realize, when people wonder whats the deal with Carol and the death defier, they forget that they&amp;#39;re cyclic.

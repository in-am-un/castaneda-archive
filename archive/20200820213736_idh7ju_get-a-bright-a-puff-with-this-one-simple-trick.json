you need to be able to feel your eyes, then press very gently (if you guys press too much and fuck up your eyes its not my fault) continue pressing for 10 to 30 secs, you should start seeing a strong light in front of you and some veiny light filaments, then open your eyes, the brightness will fade after a while but sometime a particular spot of light remains lit up an becomes a puff, i would say success rate for me is 20% of the times, i use this 2 times for each practice session  at the beginning and if my mind gets too noisy, with this the colors can get pretty intense so its a nice way to force silence, also people that start to practice waking dreaming can use this to get a rough idea on how puffs might look like, (i tend to not overuse this, cause im not sure if its too good for the eyes, but given that i discovered this one while i was massaging my eyes after a long pc session i think it can't be too bad)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[press \\(GENTLY\\)

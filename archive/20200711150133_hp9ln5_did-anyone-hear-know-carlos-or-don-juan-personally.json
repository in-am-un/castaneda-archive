And one technique inevitably leads to the others.\n\nFor instance, in order to do waking dreaming, which is what makes most of the cool stuff in the books happen,  you have to learn to move your assemblage point all the way to heightened awareness. That's the orange part at the end of that J curve in the little man in the middle of this picture.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f](https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f)\n\nThe stuff in there is what you can do, if you learn to move it. I do all of that stuff daily, for hours.\n\nAs a result, I remain in heightened awareness most of the day.\n\nIn heightened awareness you become aware of your interactions with other people.\n\nStrongly aware!\n\nIf you bump up against them too much, it leaves traces in your consciousness.\n\nThey cause the internal dialogue to resume.\n\nSo if you want to witness real magic each day, you have to learn to avoid bumping up against people in the wrong way.\n\nExcept you can't really avoid everyone.\n\nAnd when you have such an interaction, you realize you need to undo it.\n\nThat's why recapitulation exists.  To remove the luminous fibers they embed in you, during the interaction, and to retrieve the ones you lost in them.  Here's a picture.  The yellow line is what you can learn to see during recapitulation.  That's what we're manipulating with recap:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/ix255z33ns051.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a486b1c42863eaae2b92054b8f6400eba4a9c60](https://preview.redd.it/ix255z33ns051.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a486b1c42863eaae2b92054b8f6400eba4a9c60)\n\nBut it's best to avoid such interactions, so stalking was invented.\n\nIf you learn to move the assemblage point, you are then forced to learn about recapitulation and stalking.  You have no choice.\n\nAnd you'll run into visitors if you get silent. Here's some example of ones I have possession of, I also have access to \"the little smoke\" ally and to the Devil's Weed ally:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ggq1p8/pictures\\_of\\_iobs\\_inorganic\\_beings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ggq1p8/pictures_of_iobs_inorganic_beings/)\n\nYou'll also run into dreamers, such as Cholita in that image.  Cholita even created a parallel copy of our house, with a power spot for changing from waking copy to the dreaming copy, in the hallway:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/bqdb0tsdnh651.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bfa1a7e4cfd65e4bd6eaf94fb569a58a22f1140](https://preview.redd.it/bqdb0tsdnh651.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bfa1a7e4cfd65e4bd6eaf94fb569a58a22f1140)\n\nSo when you say, \"I believe\", you haven't even begun to believe!\n\nWhen you have a demon standing over you threatening to bite, is about when you start to *really* believe.\n\nEverything  you see in those pics can be done by you, and comes with instructions.  Maybe go through the wiki and read?  I'm here by agreement with Carlos from 25 years ago.  Just to try to speed students up, since so far it's not working out very well for people.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/illustrations](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/illustrations)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fxp7tpq", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew Carlos for years.

And one technique inevitably leads to the others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, in order to do waking dreaming, which is what makes most of the cool stuff in the books happen,  you have to learn to move your assemblage point all the way to heightened awareness. That&amp;#39;s the orange part at the end of that J curve in the little man in the middle of this picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stuff in there is what you can do, if you learn to move it. I do all of that stuff daily, for hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, I remain in heightened awareness most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In heightened awareness you become aware of your interactions with other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Strongly aware!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you bump up against them too much, it leaves traces in your consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They cause the internal dialogue to resume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you want to witness real magic each day, you have to learn to avoid bumping up against people in the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except you can&amp;#39;t really avoid everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you have such an interaction, you realize you need to undo it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why recapitulation exists.

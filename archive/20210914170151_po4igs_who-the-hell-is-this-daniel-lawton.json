With some opportunities in between.\n\nI was the son of an anthropologist studying the Indians at Morongo reservation, the place Joanie Baker took Carlos while looking for a \"source\" (Shaman) to study. There were continuous rumors that Carlos had visited recently, come to their festival, or that he was standing just past the movie crews as they were filming a move at Morongo. If he was there at the movie filming as someone claimed, I first saw him knowingly while taking a polaroid of Susan Clark, the \"sexy\" actress in that movie. She lifted her skirt for me (I was 12), I complained to the people standing there watching that she'd ruined the picture because you could see her panties, and someone said, \"That's Carlos Castaneda over there!\"\n\n I turned to see a man with a woman on his arm, watching.\r  \n\r  \nI was also around Taisha a few times without realizing it. Including at the famous Budokan tournament before which the karate pictures were taken at the university. I knew her from visiting Nishiyama's school, the woman hating head master of Los Angeles Dojo in the early 70s. I most likely practiced across from her a couple of times, having a memory now of a pixy hair cut on a young woman, who was one of only two women in classes. Women were rare back then.\r  \n\r  \nI almost surely saw the famous Gi pictures being snapped, without realizing it had any significance. I was told by someone watching her that women can't spar at tournaments, so they do \"katas\" instead. And that they were taking pictures of her and her friend because women were so rare that they made better publicity photos.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, I suffer from prosopagnosia and can't see faces well enough to even remember my waitress in a restaurant. So I can't say I recognize Taisha from seeing her back then. Or from any other time I've seen her.\r  \n\r  \nFrom workshop notes and what's in her books, it turns out I flew on the same airplane as her karate team going to the tournament at the Budokan in Japan. \n\nI might have been standing right next to Carlos several times along the way, without realizing it.\r  \n\r  \nBut officially, I created the Nagualist Newsletter, a free publication to gather workshop notes and personal experiences from people interested in the books. Back around 1994. Carlos saw it, didn't like it, and asked one or two of the inner circle women to get me to stop. \n\nHe was under attack from a bunch of men pretending to have sorcery knowledge. Many still victimize the Castaneda community with their pretending and greed.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I agreed to stop the publication they let me in to private classes. Amy later made sure I knew, that was why I got in. I suspect Carlos was careful about paying back his debts, and had her tell me.\n\nThe private classes changed locations at first, and I can't recall all of the locations. Might have been as many as 8 if you count Christmas sessions that ended up in odd places.\r  \n\r  \nThe first day I was present in private classes at Dance Home, Carlos taught us \"Zuleica's Pass\".

I kept altering my movements a tiny bit hoping to see on his face that I had gotten it right now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d nod subtly, but never said anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the movement stuck in my mind, and in fact it&amp;#39;s part of the basis for darkroom gazing. Several things that created the basis of darkroom gazing came about because of odd behavior on the part of Carlos, which caused those things to stick in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/po4igs/who_the_hell_is_this_daniel_lawton/hcugeiw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1631641229.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_po4igs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 18}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hd40wcv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1631817629.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_po4igs", "score": 18, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "10 What is it like to be on the sorcery path?\n\nEach day you grow in knowledge and power.\n\nBut also each day, the people around you seem more and more like spoiled angry children, who are randomly and carelessly harmful to others.\n\nAnd crazy as a bag lady.\n\nThey become like the merchants on the side of the road, after Genaro spun with the Ally and could no longer find his way back to Ixtlan.\n\nThe fact is, it's cold on the sorcery path!\n\nNot cozy at all.\n\nWhen I hear people going on about the, \"path with heart\", I know they have no sorcery knowledge at all.\n\nBecause the \"path with heart\" takes both magic, and other people at the same level as you to explore it with.\n\nOf which there are virtually none.\n\nBut it's still the only thing we can do in life, that has any meaning.\n\nI'm afraid, all of the world's religions are false.

From your perspective as a student, what was Carlos's plan to teach sorcery?\n\nWe won't be able to figure that out for many years.  Every month now I see something else he \"might\" have done, that wasn't obvious.\n\nHis stated plan, repeated by the witches, was to let us \"clean ourselves off\" using recapitulation and Tensegrity, and then hopefully we'd do some silence practice on our own.\n\nBut the silence practice could lead to trouble.  When the assemblage point moves some people have erratic fluctuations, either due to use of power plants, mental illness, or they're just simply oddballs.\n\nInstead of moving down gradually it can shift sideways quite far.\n\nThe result of big \"lateral\" shifts is always unpleasant.\n\nYou can get a bunch of \"what do I do if\" type questions if people learn to move their assemblage points too fast, which don't matter because nothing stays the same in sorcery.  \n\nBut the questions can linger in the air for a while, and could alter the opinions of others. In a negative way.\n\nSo if people could do just tensegrity and recap for a while, Carlos was likely thinking he could turn them into better students and bring out the magic later on when it was safer.\n\n\"Stopping the World\" seems to have been what he had planned to use, for bringing out magic.\n\nOnce everyone was a little less crazy as a result of recap and tensegrity.\n\nUnfortunately, he developed fatal cancer and died.\n\nOtherwise, I have no doubt he would have succeeded.\n\nNow I look back, and at what's happening now, and I believe he released the dangerous stuff at the last minute.  When he had no choice because he'd be gone before he could manage teaching it properly.\n\nThat's supported by the \"Silent Knowledge\" publication, which gives us advice for what to do without him, based on the assumption we'll know how to move our assemblage points on demand.\n\nSomething no one had learned at the time.\n\nBut maybe the most important thing is, he sent Little Smoke and Devil's Weed to help.\n\nHe introduced them to us in class, making sure we perceived them in some manner, three times.\n\nNo one payed attention to them after that. I don't believe anyone could get silent enough to perceive them, so no one realized they were at our command.\n\nThere's nothing more useful than an inorganic being, for moving the assemblage point of a beginner.\n\nJust by noticing them you give them the ability to move your assemblage point to very distant locations.  And you pick up their dark energy, which we need or we can't move our assemblage points far enough to reach heightened awareness.\n\nBut  I didn't realize there might be some underlying plan to it for the first 20 years after he released them to help us.\n\nOnce a year the two of them would show up and persecute me, with the result being I couldn't ignore what I'd learned.  But I also didn't want to call them on purpose.\n\nI got into a comfortable pattern of moving my assemblage point and activating the second attention, as if it were simply a meditation technique, knowing even more was possible if I wanted to summon the Allies.\n\nAt one point I ran into a double woman in a bakery.\n\nI couldn't believe my eyes. She was lit up like the cover of one of Carlos' books, where the person has no face. Just fibers of light spraying outwards, where their head ought to be.\n\nI didn't do anything about the first.  Lost her because I didn't take it seriously.\n\nThe next time I ran into a double being, years later, Little Smoke and Devil's Weed took notice.\n\nThey started pushing  me around even more.   I got the impression this was the \"last chance\" to preserve the knowledge.\n\nFinally they cornered me in Singapore, and began to scare me in my hotel room.  I kept a bath full of cold water ready, in case they materialized physically in my room.  \n\nThey liked to emerge from a tunnel Carol Tiggs had pushed me into, back in private classes.\n\nThe last time they visited I didn't have a bathtub ready, and so  they actually chased me down the hallways of the hotel.\n\nA few days later I fell into heightened awareness.  For weeks.\n\nI realized what Carlos had been trying to teach us. In heightened awareness, you suddenly have the answer to any question  you might have.\n\nYou \"know\" everything.\n\nExcept, the knowledge is nearly useless.  I suppose it's like knowing something useful, which can only be used if you live 1000 miles away from where you do.\n\nSo it's true knowledge, but you can't make much use of it.\n\nWhen I finally resigned myself to realizing sorcery was not so difficult, but you had to learn to move your assemblage point every day, I decided I needed my own Ally.\n\nTo help me figure it out without Carlos.  \n\nBut I was finished with Little Smoke and Devil's Weed. They were too scary.\n\nI found \"Fairy\" on some puffs of purple light, which were visible when I practiced Tensegrity in darkness, while forcing myself silent.\n\nI knew the light was there, because in heightened awareness I could even see it in daylight.\n\nSo the truth is, Little Smoke taught me to perceive the light of Tensegrity, and after the heightened awareness wore off I used my own ability to bring it out, with the help of darkness.\n\nAnd I found \"Fairy\".\n\nBut as it turned out, Fairy was simply Little Smoke.  I hadn't realized I could just insist she take on a less scary form.\n\nShe managed my use of darkness and Tensegrity, flying around the room and recommending where to scoop from next, and where to put it.\n\nShe got me back to heightened awareness.\n\nSo, Little Smoke seems to have rescued this situation.\n\nWhich is not so odd.

Every month now I see something else he &amp;quot;might&amp;quot; have done, that wasn&amp;#39;t obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His stated plan, repeated by the witches, was to let us &amp;quot;clean ourselves off&amp;quot; using recapitulation and Tensegrity, and then hopefully we&amp;#39;d do some silence practice on our own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the silence practice could lead to trouble.  When the assemblage point moves some people have erratic fluctuations, either due to use of power plants, mental illness, or they&amp;#39;re just simply oddballs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of moving down gradually it can shift sideways quite far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result of big &amp;quot;lateral&amp;quot; shifts is always unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can get a bunch of &amp;quot;what do I do if&amp;quot; type questions if people learn to move their assemblage points too fast, which don&amp;#39;t matter because nothing stays the same in sorcery.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the questions can linger in the air for a while, and could alter the opinions of others. In a negative way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if people could do just tensegrity and recap for a while, Carlos was likely thinking he could turn them into better students and bring out the magic later on when it was safer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stopping the World&amp;quot; seems to have been what he had planned to use, for bringing out magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once everyone was a little less crazy as a result of recap and tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, he developed fatal cancer and died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I have no doubt he would have succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I look back, and at what&amp;#39;s happening now, and I believe he released the dangerous stuff at the last minute.  When he had no choice because he&amp;#39;d be gone before he could manage teaching it properly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s supported by the &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; publication, which gives us advice for what to do without him, based on the assumption we&amp;#39;ll know how to move our assemblage points on demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something no one had learned at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But maybe the most important thing is, he sent Little Smoke and Devil&amp;#39;s Weed to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He introduced them to us in class, making sure we perceived them in some manner, three times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one payed attention to them after that. I don&amp;#39;t believe anyone could get silent enough to perceive them, so no one realized they were at our command.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing more useful than an inorganic being, for moving the assemblage point of a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just by noticing them you give them the ability to move your assemblage point to very distant locations.  And you pick up their dark energy, which we need or we can&amp;#39;t move our assemblage points far enough to reach heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But  I didn&amp;#39;t realize there might be some underlying plan to it for the first 20 years after he released them to help us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once a year the two of them would show up and persecute me, with the result being I couldn&amp;#39;t ignore what I&amp;#39;d learned.  But I also didn&amp;#39;t want to call them on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got into a comfortable pattern of moving my assemblage point and activating the second attention, as if it were simply a meditation technique, knowing even more was possible if I wanted to summon the Allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point I ran into a double woman in a bakery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t believe my eyes. She was lit up like the cover of one of Carlos&amp;#39; books, where the person has no face. Just fibers of light spraying outwards, where their head ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t do anything about the first.  Lost her because I didn&amp;#39;t take it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next time I ran into a double being, years later, Little Smoke and Devil&amp;#39;s Weed took notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They started pushing  me around even more.   I got the impression this was the &amp;quot;last chance&amp;quot; to preserve the knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally they cornered me in Singapore, and began to scare me in my hotel room.  I kept a bath full of cold water ready, in case they materialized physically in my room.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They liked to emerge from a tunnel Carol Tiggs had pushed me into, back in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last time they visited I didn&amp;#39;t have a bathtub ready, and so  they actually chased me down the hallways of the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days later I fell into heightened awareness.  For weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized what Carlos had been trying to teach us. In heightened awareness, you suddenly have the answer to any question  you might have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, the knowledge is nearly useless.  I suppose it&amp;#39;s like knowing something useful, which can only be used if you live 1000 miles away from where you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s true knowledge, but you can&amp;#39;t make much use of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I finally resigned myself to realizing sorcery was not so difficult, but you had to learn to move your assemblage point every day, I decided I needed my own Ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To help me figure it out without Carlos.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was finished with Little Smoke and Devil&amp;#39;s Weed. They were too scary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot; on some puffs of purple light, which were visible when I practiced Tensegrity in darkness, while forcing myself silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew the light was there, because in heightened awareness I could even see it in daylight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the truth is, Little Smoke taught me to perceive the light of Tensegrity, and after the heightened awareness wore off I used my own ability to bring it out, with the help of darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I found &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as it turned out, Fairy was simply Little Smoke.  I hadn&amp;#39;t realized I could just insist she take on a less scary form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She managed my use of darkness and Tensegrity, flying around the room and recommending where to scoop from next, and where to put it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She got me back to heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, Little Smoke seems to have rescued this situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is not so odd.  Little Smoke and Devil&amp;#39;s Weed were the real teachers in the early books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The power plants were just what Carlos had asked to learn.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the real power was don Juan&amp;#39;s Allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;History repeated itself with me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Devil&amp;#39;s Weed ultimately paired up with a witch from private classes, who Carlos called &amp;quot;Cholita&amp;quot; on one occasion.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was making a &amp;quot;mini-me&amp;quot; joke about her and her sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Devil&amp;#39;s Weed formed into a new being also, which I named, &amp;quot;Minx&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He introduced me to phantom realities through Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With an understanding of how to move the assemblage point on demand, and phantom realities, we pretty much have everything we need for learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Allies of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did he plan that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation with &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot; about it one evening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was standing on my hand, 4 inches tall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I released her into the air to show me where to apply Tensegrity moves next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said something like, &amp;quot;It all had to end you know.

There was a northerly woman, a southerly one, a westerly one, and  the last I couldn't figure out, but she must have fit the easterly mold.\n\nThey followed her around to bars because she was such a sensation with men, all they had to do was hang out and there was \"male fallout\".\n\nShe was 22.  And also a disaster, just as don Juan had implied you would find, with female double beings. I believe he said you do them a favor, to deviate their lives.\n\nIt took 2 years of stalking, but I finally got all 5 women together at once.\n\nAnd it was a disaster.\n\nI was off the hook.  There was no way to teach sorcery to any of them.  All wanted husbands with a good job more than anything else.\n\nI realized that don Juan had recommended to gather the women first, but then find the male and the whole thing would sort of \"fall into place\".\n\nThe women may have gotten lured in with promises of a place to say and a purpose in life, but ultimately they needed the whole arrangement, with some men around too.\n\nMen give the laser like drive that women lack because they don't have the same tunnel vision as men do. You need both, to make a stable situation.  A magical \"lifestyle\".\n\nI couldn't ever achieve that.  Even don Juan could not have done that. He had 15 helpers in his lineage, just to do what he managed to do.

Like criticize Buddhism for example.\n\nOn the internet, you don't have to care.

There was a northerly woman, a southerly one, a westerly one, and  the last I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out, but she must have fit the easterly mold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They followed her around to bars because she was such a sensation with men, all they had to do was hang out and there was &amp;quot;male fallout&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was 22.  And also a disaster, just as don Juan had implied you would find, with female double beings. I believe he said you do them a favor, to deviate their lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took 2 years of stalking, but I finally got all 5 women together at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it was a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was off the hook.  There was no way to teach sorcery to any of them.  All wanted husbands with a good job more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized that don Juan had recommended to gather the women first, but then find the male and the whole thing would sort of &amp;quot;fall into place&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women may have gotten lured in with promises of a place to say and a purpose in life, but ultimately they needed the whole arrangement, with some men around too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men give the laser like drive that women lack because they don&amp;#39;t have the same tunnel vision as men do. You need both, to make a stable situation.  A magical &amp;quot;lifestyle&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t ever achieve that.  Even don Juan could not have done that. He had 15 helpers in his lineage, just to do what he managed to do.  And even that didn&amp;#39;t work well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 7 years wasted on the double woman, someone saw a question on the internet somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A weird question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He suggested, &amp;quot;You could answer that for him!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I realized, there&amp;#39;s the internet now!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Carlos had that he would have had access to thousands more people, and could find out who works hard and who doesn&amp;#39;t, without using up as much of his time as he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And without always having to worry you&amp;#39;ll say something that makes you hardest worker go elsewhere. Like criticize Buddhism for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the internet, you don&amp;#39;t have to care.  People come and go, and you can just wait to see who succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the ancient Olmecs didn&amp;#39;t have access to these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s ideal for teaching sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/po4igs/who_the_hell_is_this_daniel_lawton/hd3ty8z/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1631814808.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_po4igs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 15}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hcvywgj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1631664080.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_po4igs", "score": 13, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "4   Could you briefly relate the famous explanation of J Curve?\n\nThe one that tells what happens if you move it yourself, at each position along the way?  The one for which we now have a \"map\"?\n\nI thought the explanation Carlos gave us of what happens as the assemblage point moves was unique to private classes, and for some reason Cleargreen had ignored it after Carlos died.\n\nBut someone recently found a place where don Juan mentioned it in the books!\n\nAnd then someone found notes from a workshop in Mexico, where the witches explained that it could be done.\n\nDon Juan even said that the Nagual's Blow could push the assemblage point in, but it can also move around the outside to \"any position\".\n\nWow! That's superior to the Nagual's Blow which seems to stay inside man's band of emanations.\n\nThe J curve explanation came at a time when it was obvious Carlos was going to die.  Everyone still had hope, but Carlos started to alter his teaching plans.\n\nAnd there were rumors that he was going to \"show us\" things.   Some actual magic.\n\nHe came to class one day with two new women standing close to him.\n\nThere had been the usual rumors about who they were, but I never paid any attention to such things. Even if I knew who they were, I wouldn't be able to point them out.  I'm face blind.\n\nThey eventually replaced the Chacmools on stage for a few workshops, probably because Carlos was pleased they had moved their assemblage points by themselves.\n\nWhen he gave the explanation he had one of them standing right by him. The other was presumably just behind her, standing near the Chacmools.\n\nThe woman was wearing a tight black outfit, which is about all I could focus on. It may not be obvious why now, but at the time everyone was wondering if Carlos messed with the women.\n\nYes, he did!  But so did Julian, and don Juan.  And every male and female who ever went to any sort of school, past elementary.  They still do out at the retirement home.\n\nSo let's just get over that. We aren't trying to become saints.  I hope we never do.\n\nBut Carlos was merely using her as a human model in this case, on which he was moving his finger along her back.  And laughing a tiny bit for every second of it!\n\nHe was aware of everyone's keen interest in where his finger was going next, and played it up to best effect.\n\nIt might be why the whole lecture stuck in my mind, while everyone else who heard it seems to have forgotten.\n\nSo if you learn to do this, and you're holding a brilliant purple puff of intense light in your hand marveling at how wonderful real magic is, think to yourself, \"this is all because Dan remembered the woman in the very tight black outfit\".\n\nCarlos started by explaining that the assemblage point was located behind us at arms length, up from the left shoulder blade at an angle.  He stuck his hand back there where it was located behind the woman, and wiggled his fingers to show how big it was.\n\nThen he moved his hand down an imaginary line to show where it was, projected onto the human body.\n\nIt was obviously easier to explain with his finger pointing on her body, rather than out in the air behind her, up too high to make any sense.\n\nAt the top of the path it could move, it was pretty much on the left shoulder blade.\n\nHe showed us how it could move left or right up  there, without dropping down. He explained what that was like, but all I can remember is that we've all experienced that. It causes you to become moody,  Moves as part of a woman's menstrual cycle, and can also move drastically if you have  a fever.\n\nHorizontal movements up there didn't sound fun.\n\nWhen I drew what he explained, I labeled that the \"blue line\", because moving around horizontally there could certainly give you the blues (sadness).\n\nHis finger was at the top by the shoulder blades, and he made it known that the path it would move would be down.\n\nHe moved it down to what is now the \"green line\", and showed that a left or right movement at that depth produced fun but mild hallucinations, sensations, and generally \"safe\" magic.  I can say now, it's the same effects you get with meditation, or shamanic drumming.  When you \"see the room with your eyes closed\", you are firmly at the green line!\n\nThere are NOT different kinds of magic.  At least, not anywhere we could find them.  Instead all magic systems use the same principles, but with slightly different techniques.\n\nThey all seek to move the assemblage point, using a modified or absent internal dialogue.\n\nNone of them know about the assemblage point, so they move it in ignorance.\n\nBut they do manage to move it, around half as far as we do.\n\nAs far perhaps as you can without \"dark energy\" gotten from inorganic beings and witches.  When you hear a Daoist say that spirits are dangerous, remind yourself that means, his magic is almost non-existant.\n\nCarlos moved this finger down to her lower back, where you see the red line in the J curve diagram.  As he moved left and right, no more than 2 inches each direction, he explained how that level was used for shapeshifting.\n\nI'm afraid, by then my eyes were entirely on the woman's butt, wondering if Carlos would continue the same path with his finger. And what would he do at the crotch?\n\nCarlos seemed to have noticed, laughed a bit, and started over. He moved back to the shoulder blades!\n\nThe second time I got a few more details.  At either the green level, or between green and red, there was something related to insects.  You could make use of \"crossing phylums\" there.  The insect energy was to the left, while to the right it was beast like.  You could become really strong, by moving your assemblage point to the right.  \n\nI didn't put a line there on the J curve diagram, because when someone asked even more detailed questions about insects and shape shifting there,  Carlos largely ignored it. He returned to moving his finger down to the red line.\n\nI used red color because it was in the PC Paint program's limited pallet of 20 colors,  and because what Carlos said about that level made it sound dangerous.\n\nWhich it is! If you play too much down there, or use drugs to go there (which is how drugs work), you can get stuck there and be unable to go further.\n\nThat's what happened to  Julian. He enjoyed shapeshifting a bit too much, with La Catalina as his companion.\n\nI recently became stuck there so strongly that Cholita had to pull me out.\n\nInstead of continuing down on the J curve from the red line, which would have put his finger in even more danger than the red zone, Carlos moved around to the other side of the woman, to the front, and placed his finger on her lower stomach, as if it had just finished moving under her, and back up the front.\n\nHe never described much about down there, but we've learned from direct experience, it's an area RICH with amazing magic.\n\nThe kind of stuff no one will believe.  \"The Shift Below\"!\n\nI believe Carlos next turned the woman a bit, so that her back wasn't blocking our view, and showed how the assemblage point, now moved to the front, continued up a ways, more on the right side than the left, got to a level above the belly button, and then moved right towards the liver. And once it was where the Nagual's Blow pushes the assemblage point he moved it left a bit, without a comment on why.\n\nWe later read that don Juan preferred a slight left shift at that point, because it was more \"sublime\".  Left is generally spiritual, right physical.  \n\nThe orange zone is the first place with dazzling, absolutely safe magic.\n\nYou can manifest objects, scoop dreams out of the air, shrink your Ally down to the size of your thumb, and ask them to go explore a dream for you while you hold it in your palm.\n\nYou can lift the dream, with your inorganic being inside, \"hang\" it on the air in front of you, and narrate what your IOB is doing, like you were staging a play.\n\nThey LOVE it.\n\nOr you can ask your inorganic being to give you entry to dream bubbles, and you can zip in and out until something out there \"notices\" your activity, and comes to visit.\n\nThere are things that go bump in the night, besides us and inorganic beings!\n\nI labeled that position the \"orange zone\" on the J curve diagram, but there wasn't any clear starting point for it besides \"under\" the woman's butt.  Carlos didn't move his finger along down there, to give us the fine details.\n\nSo the orange zone extends from the center below the butt, all the way up the front to the belly button on the spleen side, and then the purple zone begins.  I put it straight on the J curve, but possible it includes moving to the along the position just above the navel, over the liver.\n\nIt's labeled purple just because the PC color palette ran out.  \n\nThe purple zone is our destination. It's the home of \"Silent Knowledge\", and the place where the double becomes visible.\n\nIt's where you can find \"the abstract\", and if you want to \"stop the world\", that's where you need to move your assemblage point.\n\nWe know all this from direct experience, but also by going to and fro looking in the writings of Carlos, especially \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nThe cover of \"Wheel of Time\" shows what you can do in the orange zone, headed for the purple. It's an actual technique, and not difficult at all.\n\nIf you want to do the following, you need to at least move to \"deep orange\", which is almost purple on that J curve diagram:\n\nReplay the lives of past sorcerers.\n\nReplay your own life, as an observer or participant.\n\nChange to one of 600 cyclic beings on your chain of beings.  You are not required to return.\n\nTravel to the sand dunes mentioned in the books.\n\nAll of these are available to you, once you learn to get rid of that internal dialogue.\n\nYou don't have to pretend anymore!", "edited": 1631665623.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hcvywgj", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;4   Could you briefly relate the famous explanation of J Curve?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one that tells what happens if you move it yourself, at each position along the way?

They only spoke when asked to by Carlos, and usually they seemed reluctant. \n\nHe liked to use their energy to control how a topic was learned. For example, if he had something new to teach us he'd practically drag one of the women out to front, and claim it was their idea or their doing which caused him to need to explain that topic to us.\r  \n\r  \nCarlos seemed not to like to give details on techniques, which we now know can produce many different results. And even the method for doing many techniques can be altered a little, if the technique doesn't specify all the details.\r  \n\r  \nWhen he was \"forced\" to give details because a student specifically asked, he'd get one of the women to do it. One of the women, often Taisha, would walk over, head bent a little to the side, clear her throat, and give her opinion on what Carlos had mentioned in a voice that was a little too low.\r  \n\r  \nThat was pretty much the only way I saw the women conversing in private classes, except for when they had a guest and were protecting them on the far right of the room, behind the Chacmools. The witches were kept \"protected\" over there. Oddly, that was also where Little Smoke and Devil's Weed entities liked to hang out. By the water cooler. They could make it burp when they felt like it.\r  \n\r  \nAs I've learned sorcery, I realize that the witches seem to be quiet because they've learned to be mentally silent. That's what it looks like when people aren't endlessly trying to get attention or score points in a group setting. In fact, someone who has learned to be silent can easily spot someone who has not just by their normal \"bullying\" behavior.\n\n\r  \nBut the witches had a friendlier side. I occasionally saw that in private classes when they had a special guest.  But Cholita got to see more of it. \n\nWomen who got into private classes took a slightly different path than the men, getting personal attention and gifts from the women.\r  \n\r  \nCarlos was bold, and obviously in charge.  He usually arrived at Dance Home just as everyone was supposed to already be inside, having been warned the doors would be locked if they got there too late.\n\nThe Chacmools would pull up on the outside large street, and drop him off at the sidewalk. At least one always went with him,  Kylie in particular, but usually 2 or more just because it only took one to repark the car.  \n\nHis life was in danger from crazy followers, so it was necessary to have guards when at known public locations.\n\nHe'd walk up the stairs of Dance home, which was over a Real Foods Daily restaurant,  take his place standing in front of the class just 20 feet from the stairs  and in the middle of that north west wall, face southish towards us, and act as if we'd all been having a conversation for a while.  \n\nHe'd finish a topic he'd likely started at the bottom of the stairs, giving us just enough of it to know what he'd been discussing with the others he arrived with.\n\nAnd then move on to his prepared topic. He'd often clasp his hands together to signal it was time for the real lecture.\n\nHis lectures tended to run in 3s. He told us, you have to repeat things 3 times or people don't remember it. But each in a \"series\" seemed new.  It was just that if you paid attention,  you could see that some of the same lecture elements did in fact stick around the 3 times he recommended.\r  \n\r  \nThe topics had a sense of urgency much of the time, as if he was working on a specific thing that needed tending immediately. When the specific thing didn't work out at workshops, he'd let us know.\n\nThen give his new idea for how to proceed.\r  \n\r  \nHe as trying to gather \"energetic mass\". I now understand, he was waiting for at least a couple of students to make noticeable progress, get excited, and have the excitement spread to the group, so everyone would work harder.\n\nWe look for the same thing in the subreddit!  If you're teaching something as real and difficult as sorcery, it creates that sort of concern.\r  \n\r  \nIf he ever built up significant energetic mass, I can't recall it. Everyone was dull and lazy, just barely doing enough work not to get kicked out of classes, while waiting for someone else to \"prove\" it was worth their time.\r  \n\r  \nIn the end, Carlos warned us that he was dying, and his only hope was for the class to build enough energetic mass to allow him to \"jump grooves\" and avoid his illness.\r  \n\r  \nIt never happened, so he died. I'm convinced, it was the classes and workshops themselves that killed him.\r  \n\r  \nIt's too many students.\n\nSorcery isn't imaginary.  And it's dependent on some very tiny influences.  \n\nIt's not even a big leap to say that private classes killed him.  Unless you consider that workshops would have done him in too.\r  \n\r  \nBut he never let us realize what a burden we were, except for his jokes about battling the blue scout to hide the classes from her.\n\nAt the end the blue scout gave in, and even \"helped\".\n\nShe brought us a poster of \"the wall\", another of the main techniques we practice in darkroom gazing.  And she pointed to where she commonly saw, \"The Whorl\", when Carlos asked her to indicate it.  \r  \n\r  \nHis lectures included dirty jokes nearly every time. It was  a guarantee the entire room would laugh during his lectures, at least twice.  A genuine laugh.  He was like a comedian at times.\n\nAnd despite what some who promote fake sorcery lessons for money say, Carlos was bold about calling out his enemies.\n\nHe wasn't afraid to step on people's toes, if they were harming his ability to teach sorcery. Or selling fake sorcery books or classes.\n\n He mentioned them by name, saying in general they were \"riding his back\".\n\nTo cash in on his fame.\r  \n\r  \nHe wanted to call out other \"systems\" people had turned to,  before workshops became available.\n\nIt included just about anything you could think of.  All the usual suspects.  Buddhism, Hinduism, Daoism, Qabalah, Magick.\n\nBut you could lose a student you'd already invested a lot of time in, by criticizing something.\r  \n\r  \nBuddhism was a particularly difficult topic for Carlos. \n\nIt was a \"system\" with a strong sense of entitlement. \n\nNo one dared point out the obvious: It's not wise at all!  And it's based on a series of ugly lies.\r  \n\r  \nCarlos tried, gently, to help people see the truth about Buddhism.\r  \n\r  \nHe was a little more friendly to Asian martial arts philosophy, but without endorsing it. \n\nHe was friends with Howard Lee, a Hong Kong Daoist, and a member of his inner circle practiced Chinese medicine.\r  \n\r  \nHe used to call the energy you can visually see when doing Tensegrity, \"Chi\".\n\n\r  \nThere was a lot more hidden teaching going on during the lectures Carlos gave us. He was *intending*. Occasionally his eyes would glaze over, his head would tilt to look an odd direction, such as slightly east of south and over the heads of his audience, and he appeared to be reading from there.\r  \n\r  \nHis normal flow of words would stop, and it felt like he was reading from a teleprompter.\r  \nA few times he used his hand for that purpose, glancing down to get an answer from his palm, which was not actually written there.\r  \n\r  \nI had to check a few times just to be sure he didn't come with little notes on his hands.\n\n\r  \nUntil shortly before he died, Carlos was quite spry and flexible in classes.

They only spoke when asked to by Carlos, and usually they seemed reluctant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He liked to use their energy to control how a topic was learned. For example, if he had something new to teach us he&amp;#39;d practically drag one of the women out to front, and claim it was their idea or their doing which caused him to need to explain that topic to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos seemed not to like to give details on techniques, which we now know can produce many different results. And even the method for doing many techniques can be altered a little, if the technique doesn&amp;#39;t specify all the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he was &amp;quot;forced&amp;quot; to give details because a student specifically asked, he&amp;#39;d get one of the women to do it. One of the women, often Taisha, would walk over, head bent a little to the side, clear her throat, and give her opinion on what Carlos had mentioned in a voice that was a little too low.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was pretty much the only way I saw the women conversing in private classes, except for when they had a guest and were protecting them on the far right of the room, behind the Chacmools. The witches were kept &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot; over there. Oddly, that was also where Little Smoke and Devil&amp;#39;s Weed entities liked to hang out. By the water cooler. They could make it burp when they felt like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#39;ve learned sorcery, I realize that the witches seem to be quiet because they&amp;#39;ve learned to be mentally silent. That&amp;#39;s what it looks like when people aren&amp;#39;t endlessly trying to get attention or score points in a group setting. In fact, someone who has learned to be silent can easily spot someone who has not just by their normal &amp;quot;bullying&amp;quot; behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the witches had a friendlier side.

You can&amp;#39;t learn sorcery without the help of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; becomes super obvious to a sorcerer. Not difficult to perceive at all, in your students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; can be damaged by the wrong person in a group. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or someone without wrong motivations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A famous example is a woman who was associated with an inner circle woman. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She received a gift of shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clothing gifts were not uncommon. Cholita got some amazing clothes and shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This woman looked at the shoes and said, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t wear those!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita said she was shocked how fast she was tossed out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos gave her money to start a little bakery on Santa Monica Blvd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although she was officially &amp;quot;out&amp;quot;, the other women tried to encourage us to buy from that &amp;quot;Bluebird Bakery&amp;quot;, without explaining why.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/po4igs/who_the_hell_is_this_daniel_lawton/hculnej/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1631643360.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_po4igs", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hd3ptoj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1631813134.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_po4igs", "score": 12, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "6  What was Carlos's attitude towards inorganic beings? And yours? What do you think is the role of inorganic beings in learning sorcery?\n\nThat's a very odd topic.  Don Juan said some derogatory things about inorganic beings, and even though he admits that's just his own personal prejudice because he was afraid of them, and that we can't possible practice sorcery without their dark energy, no one notices that.\n\nBecause if you can't do something, like have your own Ally, it's easy to pretend you don't want one.\n\nAnd claim it's because you're better than people who do have one.\n\nWe get that a lot from Eastern Bloc territory where selling pretend sorcery lessons is common.\n\nWhen they hear about me they say it's all evil, and just go back to  your dreaming/stalking \"journal\", and forget about magic.\n\nWhat else are they going to do?  Certainly they never decide to actually do some work and learn the real thing.\n\nAll they want to do is more pretending!   It's far easier.\n\nYou can go around claiming you are an \"impeccable warrior\".\n\nAnd when someone asks you, \"Yea, but how come you can't do any actual magic?\",  you just insist \"magic is evil\".

The moth swooping over a campfire was Little Smoke.\n\nShe's the moth on the book covers, always watching the teaching taking place.\n\nCarlos used to do that in class for us.  Bring his Allies, and have them make noises in response to what he said.  To \"agree\" with him.\n\nLittle Smoke also helped him stop the world, as she did for me. She was the talking coyote.\n\nIn my case, she assumed the form of  a dark moth, and tapped me on my left shoulder to push me over the edge when I was on the verge of perfect silence.\n\nCarlos clearly wasn't worried about how we'd interact with his Allies.\n\nPossibly for at least 2 reasons.\n\nThey were probably with the lineage for hundreds of  years, and were carefully selected Allies.\n\nAs close to human in their intelligence, as you could find.\n\nHe introduced them to us, as he was dying.  Probably would not have, if he could have stuck around.\n\nLittle Smoke created the activity in this subreddit.\n\nShe pushed me around for at least 15 years after the death of Carlos, with the help of Devil's weed, so that I couldn't give up like everyone else from private classes.\n\nShe pushed me into heightened awareness that lasted for weeks, so that I could see visible balls of blue light, when I did Tensegrity moves.\n\nThen when my heightened awareness wore off, she visited me in the darkness.\n\nTo show me how to make tensegrity visible again.\n\nAnd made it very entertaining, so I'd practice hours each night. She posed for me, stood on my hand and turned around, and even created dramatic scenes with her walking across my bedroom floor, like a move style ghost.  Spielberg would have been jealous!\n\nShe also directed my practice so that I could learn precisely how my assemblage point moved, and teach it to others.\n\nIf I didn't know better, I'd assume Carlos sent her on purpose knowing that if all else failed, Little Smoke would take over.\n\nThe two of them were used extensively to help the Little Sisters and the Genaros.\n\nI'm not too sure about the Devil's Weed entity.   I'm not fond of it.  The main interactions we've had, were him trying to scare me to death.

And can take animal or human form.\n\nAnd can share it with more than one person at a time.\n\nSo while I tend to like Little Smoke better, I must admit that what Devil's Weed has shown me is a necessary half of what we need, to follow the path Carlos gave us.\n\nHe gave us phantom realities, where we could meet together to practice.\n\nBy the way, both entities are female.  I just call Devil's Weed \"he\", because he's never chosen to take a female form.\n\nThat could be because he belongs to Cholita for now.

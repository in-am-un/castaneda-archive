A fictional being you actually wouldn't want to be, even if it wasn't a huge lie.\n\nA greedy being on an ego trip, seeking attention everywhere he goes.\n\nAnd teaching nothing that isn't actually harmful.\n\nLet's look at the \"Four Noble Truths\"!\n\n1. **The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha)**: This truth asserts that all existence is characterized by suffering and dissatisfaction. This suffering is a fundamental part of the human condition, encompassing not just physical pain and discomfort but also psychological and emotional distress.\n2. **The Truth of the Cause of Suffering (Samudaya)**: This truth identifies desire, attachment, and craving as the root causes of suffering. It suggests that our suffering is caused by our desires for sensual pleasures, desires for existence and non-existence, and attachment to views, ideas, and perceptions.\n3. **The Truth of the End of Suffering (Nirodha)**: This truth presents the possibility of liberation from suffering. It states that by eliminating desire, attachment, and craving, one can extinguish suffering, leading to a state of ultimate peace and freedom known as Nirvana.\n4. **The Truth of the Path to the End of Suffering (Magga)**: This truth outlines the Eightfold Path as the means to end suffering. The Eightfold Path consists of right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. Following this path leads to the cessation of suffering and the achievement of enlightenment.\n\n\\#1 is a confusion created by never moving the assemblage point off the blue line, where your entire focus is on the awareness between your toes.\n\nSomething no Buddhist can visibly see but sorcerers easily do on demand. \n\nIf you move off that, \"causeless\" suffering ends.   \n\nNot pain. That takes a much larger movement.\n\nBut the psychological distress of #1 is instantly gone, if you move your assemblage point off \"me\".\n\nSo #1 is childish nonsense as an intermediate darkroomer can tell you,  and even harmful to those who believe it.\n\n\\#2 is total make believe.  The cause of your suffering is the fixation of your assemblage point up at the shoulder blades.\n\nBuddhists wouldn't know that, because they never discovered the assemblage point. \n\nBut sorcerers can not only visibly perceive it, but if they move it as far as it can go in 2 seconds they burn up and vanish from the earth.\n\nNot something easy to learn, so we have to be contented to move it quickly and watch the amazing results when you go from \"suffering\" Buddha style, to being surrounded by intense magic.\n\nWide awake, eyes open, completely sober.\n\nWhich by the way, can't be said about Buddhists.\n\nDrug usage among them is common.  Because some simply can't accept that Buddhism never really does anything, so they try another way while hiding out in the system.\n\nBut you only have to move your assemblage point, to replicate the most intense drug experience possible, and 10 times more beyond that.\n\nPutting an obvious lie to the Buddha's pretend spirituality.\n\n\\#3 is obsession with \"me, me, me\", and the belief that you can somehow change that and become \"saintly\".  \"A master\". Enlightened.\n\nIt's an ugly asian social order concept, derived from the seniority system.\n\nA sorcerer will tell you the truth.  That you cannot change yourself in any way.\n\nWhich is also obvious if you are forced to take care of an \"enlightened Buddhist master\" and discover they're huge bastards like everyone else.\n\nYou quite simply cannot change yourself. Nothing about you in fact!\n\nBut you don't need to because there are perhaps 100,000 modified copies of yourself at various positions of the assemblage point,  with those where the assemblage point moves to the other side of the body being beyond humanness, and thus beyond anything Buddhists understand.\n\nAnd Nirvana is for women in hot soothing baths.  \n\nIt's a druglike closed eye visionary ambition, which doesn't at all agree with the vast majority of the endless realities available to us.\n\nIt's a trapped human being point of view.\n\nWhat good does \"nirvana\" do you in any of the other 600 worlds we can all choose to live in, instead of this one?\n\nThe idea that you would bring \"yourself\" along into those, even if you managed to be drug highed all the time with meditation side effects, is an abomination.\n\nOver there, you're **that** person.  And they have their own delusional religions to deal with.\n\n\\#4 is designed to brainwash followers into obedience.\n\nBuddhism is really very ugly once you can see advanced sorcery states.\n\nBuddhism is a juvenile prison for the mind.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kp1heeh", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse are the &amp;quot;Four Noble Truths&amp;quot; of Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially, &amp;quot;Me, Me, Me, Me&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But ludicrous even if you analyze them as written, from the point of view of someone who has real magic, can move their assemblage far past being &amp;quot;human&amp;quot;, and can see that our entire reality is just a flow of sensations from the dark sea.

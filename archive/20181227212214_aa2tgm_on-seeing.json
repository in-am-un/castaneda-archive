Also, we learn first to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; in dreaming. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As mode of perceptions, saying one is associated with the &amp;quot;solid&amp;quot; or what you may call &amp;quot;spirit&amp;quot; (my word) is also misleading. Certainly, fluidity is at play, but I think it is a mistake or confuse &amp;quot;fluidity&amp;quot; as the opposite of, or paired with, the physical world of &amp;quot;solid&amp;quot; objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s about bringing waking awareness into the dream state and dream awareness into the waking state. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happens here is that the assemblage point is assumed to move or stay stationary. Fluidity in terms of movement of the assemblage point may or may not be associated with something physical, which again falls into the art of dreaming, making the assemblage point move. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most powerful unifying force, in Don Juan terms, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; awareness as we strive to &amp;quot;grab on to&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;let go of&amp;quot; various filaments within our luminous cocoon (which is another way of saying we move the assemblage point). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Merging these two selves would result in a unified being who can be solid or fluid at will.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s going to be one helluva NYE party.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/aa2tgm/on_seeing/ed4f89j/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_ed4f89j", "created": 1546482319.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1546482319.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_aa2tgm", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_aa2tgm", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_aa2tgm", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ee2s0qf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "sad_cosmic_joke", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_edy764p", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_ecssx", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt; I think you have a unique perspective and I would like to hear more.\n\nLikewise ! &lt;3\n\n&gt; How would you or how have you adapted his teachings?\n\nThis question has prompted me to pause for deep recapitulation.

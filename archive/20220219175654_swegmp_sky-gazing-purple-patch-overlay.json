That's what don Juan said.\n\nMy experiences suggest, the IOBs like to hold you down.\n\nOn the ground.\n\nOr \"trap\" you in a cage.\n\nBut that's largely a trick.\n\nIt's to get you to start to believe the place you are at, is \"real\".\n\nIn the darkroom, if you start to treat the puffs (down at the red line) as \"real\", you shapeshift.\n\nReality bends and distorts, as you shift horizontally.\n\nShifting a bit is super fun!  It's Merlin the Magician level magic. In your face.\n\nBut if you keep shifting, you start to shapeshift in your understanding of who you are, and what reality is.\n\nSo maybe, the IOBs can't really kidnap you.\n\nBut they can cause you to forget where you came from.  And especially, that you have a place to return to.\n\nAnd believing you are \"trapped\" is a good step in that process.\n\nBut they could also leave a shiny gold coin on the ground, causing you to pick it up.\n\nOnce you picked it up and believed it was \"real\", maybe you'd start to get sucked into the \"dream context\", and forget (lose lucidity) where you came from.\n\nThe IOBs can extend your dreaming energy, possibly endlessly.\n\nThe witches commented in some lecture that when they bring Phoebus and Globus along, their dreaming attention lasts much longer.\n\nSo the IOBs could keep you \"trapped in a dream\".  And nothing would cause you to wake up from it, because you'll still have plenty of dreaming energy left.\n\nGood to reach the 3rd gate, if you want to understand how you can become trapped in a dream!\n\nMaybe we tend to think they trapped all of  those old seers, but those guys got too old to keep going in physical form, and had to seek refuge there.

But you didn&amp;#39;t actually do that.  You only remember doing it, if you find it necessary to think in that much detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Makes sense.  That&amp;#39;s what happens in normal lucid dreaming too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get an urge in the dream (&lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; tries to wake you up), and remember you need to find  your hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then you doubt it a bit. So you look around, and it all seems fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perfectly normal!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s your wife right there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, she&amp;#39;s a cow...

Ever since Dobie Gillis was canceled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at some point, you decide to test it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have &amp;quot;infallible&amp;quot; dreaming tests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like,  you jump up high, and see how badly it hurts when you land.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the instant you &amp;quot;step away from the cow&amp;quot;, to try jumping, the truth becomes obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You had to &amp;quot;interrupt the flow&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, the fun begins!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fun people who make up their lucid dreaming, never get to have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can LEARN.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How far back can you remember the history of that place?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weeks!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much detail?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perfect detail of all of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t pretend your 4 gates dreaming.

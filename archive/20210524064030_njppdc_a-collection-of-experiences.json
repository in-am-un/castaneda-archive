I take that to mean eye dust and fibers, but one of the women swore you could see some orbs up there.\n\nA couple of the women tried it, but I never heard of any spectacular results, probably because no one knew about the J curve so they didn't force silence, and wait for the obvious effects of the assemblage point moving.\n\nJuann's able to do darkroom gazing in daylight, so sky gazing ought to work.\n\nYou're trying to see the purple in the sky, which indicates you got down to the green line.\n\nBut if you fall asleep and come back with a mini-dream barely in your memory, that's a good sign.\n\n\\&gt; I felt guilty and wondered if they were conscious.\n\nThey're pieces of you.  So don't worry about it.\n\nIOBs hang out on them, because they can project dreams.  But eventually they'll move off and make their own body. It's just that until the assemblage point drops far, we can't easily perceive the type of body they can make by themselves, so the first appearances are up on those puffs. \n\n\\&gt;I saw a vision of a hand grabbing a purple puff. \n\nProbably your double, \"helping out\".\n\nBut in fact, it's not out of the question that's someone associated with the lineage of don  Juan.\n\n\\&gt; I wasn't sure if I should take more or if that would be greedy though so I stopped L O L\n\nI was working on a technique to draw the puffs closer without using the hands.  It worked, but it formed a quagmire around my stomach, and gazing into there was like a second attention trap.\n\nBut, go ahead, and then see if you can find a \"zone\" in there, where you can gaze, and get pulled into it.\n\nThe same way you can get pulled into a view on a microscope, and turn the knob to see a different layer.\n\nIf you see that in there, keep it up, but force perfect silence.\n\nIOBs love that sort of thing.\n\nNow, how do you get quagmired?\n\nIf you \"discover\" something you intensely want to share with others, you're in the quagmire.\n\nIt's old seers territory.\n\n\\&gt;I don't remember much else of what happened, I ended up falling asleep. \n\nWomen tends to go exploring in dreaming after practicing.  But you don't have anyone to do shared dreaming with.  \n\nLook for pictures of Cholita in my posts, and try to find her.\n\nAnother witch described her to me correctly this morning.\n\n\\&gt; Does this have anything to do with women being able to attack people with their \"dark womb energy\"\n\nProbably.   But so far we don't have any long term witches available to answer stuff like this. \n\nFirst you learn some sorcery.\n\nThen you relearn the world.\n\nI supposed in Buddhism and Hinduism, it means you first reach \"nothingness\". \n\nBut then you have to relearn the world in those terms, to gain higher states of enlightenment.\n\nWe have to do the same.\n\nMinus sitting on a little throne with a Jedi outfit, lording it over students.\n\nWe skip that part.\n\nSpeaking of which, when is Baby Yoda coming back?\n\nMy theory is, he and his Jedi are clones of Yoda and Luke.\n\nPast lives?\n\nNonsense.

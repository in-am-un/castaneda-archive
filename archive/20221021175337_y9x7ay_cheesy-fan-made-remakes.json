Right in your own practice room.\n\nFancy, my Ally, got carried away and volunteered to star in the cartoon.\n\nBut mostly Silent Knowledge doesn't have to be visual. I just prefer that.\n\nI glanced up at the south corner of the room, and slightly east. I had remembered that Carlos had pointed that direction out to me several times. In tricky ways I didn't realize at the time.\n\nOn one occasion he stood the blue scout right next to me, seemingly at random, and she had a pained look on her face. I believe she was a bit afraid of me.\n\nHe pointed up in the air to her left side, but from where I was standing, it was that south and slightly eastern direction that Carlos liked to \"Read from infinity\".\n\nSo for the longest time I thought that was the ideal direction for reading text messages.\n\nBut it was the left of Patty, who also glanced up there.\n\nCarlos explained how a \"whorl\" forms. Almost like a yin/yang symbol in its \"ideal\" form, where the jet blackness eats up purple or some other color as it slowly swirls.\n\nA pomegranate dot is generated by the motion, often at the tip of the color as the blackness eats it up.\n\nText scrolls from that.\n\nMyself, I like standing in full on photorealistic cartoons to experience Silent Knowledge. Who cares if you can interpret them easily? They're super cool!\n\nLet the Buddhists or Daoists \"interpret\" stuff. That's all they can do anyway.  They sit like a lazy Buddha with their eyes closed until they doze off, have a vision, and then they turn it into a \"scroll deal\".\n\nAnd we get stuck with that \"wisdom\".\n\nI say do it awake, eyes open, and have no limits on how much magic you can do.\n\nIf you like step off into the virtual realms, right through the solid walls of your darkroom.\n\nWho wants to sleep through their dreams?!   Such a waste...\n\nBut I want to fulfill the suggestion Carlos and don Juan gave us, to read text instead of watching confusing videos in the air.\n\nLike you see on the cover of Wheel of Time, where the Olmec in a loincloth is looking at all the phases of the moon in the sky.\n\nSeems cool enough to me. But don Juan himself suggested we look for sky writing instead.\n\nSince I realized Carlos had pointed out it should be slightly up to your left, but also south with a bit of an inclination east, I reoriented myself and sat on the bed. So I was doing both of the suggestions Carlos had made for reading from infinity.\n\nI also realized he wanted us to look to the left, to use the left sided awareness.\n\nI must admit to having a preference for the right. I guess that makes me a bad person?\n\nUp near the ceiling on the left several pomegranate dots materialized, and yellow text rolled out of them as if it were stuck to a thin christmas ribbon of the same color.\n\nSo it is possible to become a \"Reader of Infinity\"!\n\nIn the meantime, here's the \"Grant\" for our cartoons.\n\nExcept his name is Grian, which is part of the root original language words for Grant.\n\nHe's going to be a tiny bit like Loki I suppose, because we need a character to go out with Westerly Witch on Errands, and accidentally step through the cracks in the world present near Dance Home and Little Tokyo in Los Angeles.\n\nCarlos spoke about them one class. Ralph had stepped though one.\n\nI literally fell through one in Little Tokyo.\n\nThe cartoons are intended to carry everything Carlos taught us, even when some of it is too weird to believe.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cheesy Fan Made Remakes", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"dzr0aibqj6v91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 166, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dzr0aibqj6v91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=127e71b2a2b0d8ceec6242972f114cf2860beb94"}, {"y": 332, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dzr0aibqj6v91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=896aee7e9b234a7713d43c02b69efad9c12546bf"}, {"y": 492, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dzr0aibqj6v91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43c7af8c2e15bd035611b745caeb79a715134a0c"}], "s": {"y": 738, "x": 480, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dzr0aibqj6v91.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46f16308c79938f7227f4e12618bff3d2fdfd3f2"}, "id": "dzr0aibqj6v91"}}, "name": "t3_y9x7ay", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/SEGFH0M-tg6ifB1iAdfzau1gj5bamHG7JTnzP3rvz6w.jpg", "edited": 1666379098.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1666367617.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dzr0aibqj6v91.png?width=480&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=46f16308c79938f7227f4e12618bff3d2fdfd3f2\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/dzr0aibqj6v91.png?width=480&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=46f16308c79938f7227f4e12618bff3d2fdfd3f2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Youtube plays fan made remakes of popular TV series, and Star Trek gets its share.

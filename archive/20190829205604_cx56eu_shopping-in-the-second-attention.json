I could see the filaments, and I didn\u2019t even have to move her assemblage point.  I asked her if she was aware of it, and she didn\u2019t answer.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t complain either, and she\u2019s not a fan of mysterious questions.\n\nIn case this post gets out of order, Cholita is one of the women from Carlos\u2019 private classes. He gave her that name.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t like it when I call her that, and I\u2019m forced to remind her that she is in fact kind of short.\n\nThe diminutive suits her, but I guess she doesn\u2019t like the other implications in that name. When Carlos first met her, she was all dolled up with a lot of eye makeup, and amazing long hair.\n\nSince then she barely wears any visible makeup, and her hair is always cropped very short like a Chacmool.\n\nWhat Carlos did to her stuck.\n\nAs far as I know, she was around private classes for years, although occasionally she denies having been there that long.\n\nShe was also a fixture at workshops, which she attended for free and helped in the \u201cbookstore\u201d.\n\nShe\u2019s apparently a westerly dreamer, because she\u2019s gone quite mad and is stuck in dreaming a good portion of the day.  And she behaves a lot like Zuleica and Zoila, when they were caught up in their madness.\n\nMinus the part about showing off Zoila\u2019s vagina,  unfortunately for me.\n\nWhen Carlos knew he was dying, he set up some new connections between people in his group. I passed on a vague connection to the witches, offered me by another classmate who\u2019d been put up to it.\n\nAnd so I ended up with the care of Cholita, who has done ok these last 25 years.  But now she can\u2019t take care of herself.\n\nUsually if she doesn\u2019t like a question I ask her, because it has implications of \u201cthe nagual\u201d (what she and many others in private classes exclusively called Carlos), she\u2019ll say, \u201cThat part of my life is over!!!\u201d\n\nBut not when I asked her about her second attention energy body glowing more than normal yesterday. I guess at some level, she\u2019s aware of it.\n\nWhen I asked her, it stopped. I interrupted some kind of flow, which had caused it to become stronger. I could even *hear* that some kind of flow had stopped.\n\nI've been trying to figure out what the circumstances are, to encourage that flow. *Seeing* that in daylight is an amazing experience.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest here. Who can possibly believe all this crap about energy bodies and *seeing*?\n\nNo one. Even if they say they do.  As the one guy said, it's delusional.\n\nI don\u2019t believe it myself, and my bedroom is literally like a Harry Potter movie, nightly.\n\nIn fact, some of it makes Harry Potter movies look unimaginative.\n\nBut still, *seeing* in daylight?\n\nI don\u2019t believe it.\n\nBut there\u2019s Cholita, with myriads of lines of light, radiating out from her and touching everything around the area.\n\nA couple of longer ones literally whip or scoop the environment, in slow motion.\n\nAnd it all looks just the way Carlos described.\n\nIf Carlos wasn\u2019t making that up, what else isn\u2019t made up?\n\nAnd with Cholita being so full of energy, any chance to observe her is guaranteed to be eventful.\n\nSometimes she radiates dark energy, but even then her luminous shell isn\u2019t obvious. The two seem to be separate things.\n\nThe dark energy itself is almost visible, as a brown or blue or purple (it's all of those) cloud of sorts. But it has no strong details, as the energy body does.\n\nIt\u2019s provoked from inside her. Typically she starts laughing uncontrollably, calms down, and then radiates dark energy.\n\nIf you can be around it, you can absorb it. That plus silence produces waking dreaming.  I've had to fight entering a dream twice now, while diving her around.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen orange energy radiating from women. That\u2019s not the same as dark energy. It\u2019s more like warmth, and tends to move a silent person deeper into heightened awareness.  In his books, Carlos attributed that color to Northerly women.\n\nIn classes he often spoke about \u201cscouts\u201d, which I now conclude are women with unusual amounts of specific types of energy. They\u2019re scouts, because they can lead you places you hadn\u2019t planned to go, due to their energy.\n\nThe disorganized behavior of the \"scouts\" he had collected always surprised me, but I was thinking about it wrong. The tendency is to superimpose your own religious beliefs on top of what Carlos was up to.  And so every significant figure in his group ought to be like a saint.\n\nThat's completely wrong.   Cholita's a mess, but she's still very significant and powerful.\n\nI can only imagine what Carlos saw, looking out at private classes.   If he could see those types of energy in people, his ability to manipulate the situation was greater than we knew.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious now why he would occasionally stop at people who were practicing tensegrity, mostly women, and put his hand behind them just below their shoulders.  He didn\u2019t touch them, he just lingered his hand there.\n\nAnd he did do that with a few men also.  A European was one of them, as I recall.\n\nHe once traced the entire length of a woman\u2019s body, moving his hand an inch or two from her actual skin, as if he were feeling something just a few inches above it. The entire time he was discussing the path her assemblage point had taken.\n\nHis hand didn\u2019t keep going the whole time, which would have made more sense for what he was explaining.  Instead, he stopped it a couple of times, backed it up an inch or two, and went over that area again,  as if he was smoothing out a left over wrinkle.\n\nI guess, when your first attention body \u201cfeels\u201d a  second attention energy body, either your own  or someone else\u2019s, the best it can come up with is the sensation of a cobweb, or ants crawling on the skin.\n\nIf you can feel that, then all you have to do to manipulate someone\u2019s assemblage point a little bit, is touch the part of the luminous shell near it.\n\nHoward Lee did a similar thing, when he was treating patients. He had them lie on their stomachs, on his massage table, and he\u2019d place his hand above a specific area, pointing his fingers down slightly as if he could push energy into them.\n\nHe once told Cholita, \u201cI don\u2019t need the needles anymore.\u201d   (Acupuncture needles)\n\nBeing a seer, I guess it\u2019s logical that Howard would be doing the same sort of things that Carlos was doing.\n\nIn Cholita\u2019s case, sometimes it\u2019s very easy to feel her energy body as cobwebs, all around her at waste level.   I can even follow the path she just walked in, and find some lingering there.\n\nIf they get especially strong, they become visible.  The sight of even one of them pulls my own assemblage point into dreaming awake, where I can see them more clearly.\n\nOther times, there\u2019s nothing.\n\nSo what\u2019s the missing factor that gets her energy body so worked up?  What cases the \u201cflow\u201d?\n\nShopping.\n\nI should have guessed. When Cholita goes shopping, especially at Whole Foods, her eyes focus on one object after the other, looking for treasures.  She grabs a yellow tomato and samples it, smells the soaps, and gazes at product labels to make sure she finds the right thing.\n\nThat\u2019s bound to bring out her second attention.\n\nI ran this by someone who writes to me, and is nearly able to *see*.  He has a witch for a wife.  He asked her, and she readily agreed.\n\nShe said that when women go shopping, especially if there are 2 of them, they both get energy from it. And when she says \u201cenergy\u201d, being a witch, she means the sorcery kind.\n\nIf you think about it, humans are hunter/gatherers. But generally, men are the hunters, and women the gatherers. It just makes sense from a survival point of view.\n\nSo maybe women make the best \u201cscouts\u201d, and if they have unusual amounts of energy, they can change the course of an entire group of people, with their \u201cdiscoveries\u201d.\n\nAs Carlos was saying towards the end, if he could find \u201cthe orange scout\u201d it would all be finished.  Or over. Or done.\n\nI\u2019m not sure which. I never heard that myself.  Cholita told me about it.  When I try to get the exact words, she goes through that list I just wrote.\n\nWhen I asked if he said that while he was trying to gather 200 women to do tensegrity, she was unaware of that event.\n\nAs for the shopping theory,  in private classes Carlos came in one day, seemingly very worried . He announced that Taisha and Florinda were lost in the second attention.\n\nI looked around the room to see if people were taking him seriously.   Everyone else was also looking around the room for answers.\n\nThey\u2019d really vanished?  Physically?\n\nNo one seemed to be able to confirm it.  But, it was true they weren\u2019t in the room that day.\n\nThe next day they showed up as if nothing had happened. Carlos gave them a shaming glance, as if to say,  \u201cdon\u2019t do that again!\u201d\n\nSomeone asked them if they were really lost in the second attention.\n\nOne of them said, \u201cWe went shopping!\u201d", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Shopping in the Second Attention", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Cholita"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_cx56eu", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Cholita", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1567105240.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1567104964.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholita lit up her energy body again yesterday.

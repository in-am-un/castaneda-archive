Pulling the Horizon\n\nMajor. This starts out with feet shoulder-width apart. There are three segments to this pass.\n\n(1) Start with both arms down at the sides. Looking to the left, slowly raise left arm, palm down, to shoulder level. Flip palm up and tighten chest, and pull left arm in tight to the side, with fingers of the left hand pointing forward. Then look to the right as the right arm begins to rise, palm down, to shoulder level. Flip palm up and pull right arm in tight to the side, with fingers of the right hand pointing forward. Slowly bring your gaze back to the center. Then bring the left hand forward, as if it were scooping up something in front, continuing until the arm is straight up. Then bring the arm to the back, with the palm now facing the ceiling. Bring it all the way back and down, turning the hand so that the palm is facing the floor. Then scoop up with the hand and bring it back by the side. Then bring the right hand forward and make the same motion. (Essentially vertical circles with each hand.) Then bring the left hand forward and flip it over, palm down. Move it across the front of the body, scanning the horizon, eyes following the hand. When it has gone as far as it can on the right side, curve it around and back, now moving from right to left. When it gets to the left side, make a wide curve around the left side, flipping the hand over again and bringing it in to the left side. Repeat this scanning motion with the right hand, and when the right hand gets to the right side, as it scans the horizon in front, bring the left hand around from the back, as if following after the right hand. Bring the right hand to the back until the left hand catches up. Meanwhile, once the left hand gets to the right side, curve it around and scan the horizon from right to left. (These horizon scans should be very purposeful movements, without bending the wrist--only bend the elbow.) Scoop the left hand back in to the left side, and scoop the right hand in to the right side. Bring both hands back in to the waist, and make them into fists.\n\n(2) With all the weight on the left foot, shift the left heel slightly inward, so as to enable the body to turn to the right more easily. Take one step to the right and face right with the arms forward. Then make three small inward circles with the right foot, keeping the sole of the foot on the ground. Step forward with the right foot, dragging the heel of the left foot forward. Now make three outward small circles on the ground with the right foot. Step forward again with the right foot, the heel of the left foot sliding forward. Now take five \"jump\" steps, like a boxer, and while taking the steps, hit out with the fists circling around each other. (Think of a boxer pummeling a boxing bag.)\n\n(3) With the right fist strike out fast directly to your right (but don't extend the arm fully). You should now be standing with the right arm extended to the right in a fist, and the left arm flexed in a fist over the middle of the upper chest. Now pivot the right heel to the right, bringing the left foot back, even with the right foot, still about one foot apart. At the same time strike out to the left with the left fist, bringing the right fist in to the upper chest. Then pivot with the left heel to the left, moving the right foot back, even with the left, and strike out with the right fist, at the same time bringing the left fist to the chest. Face front. Pivot on the right heel facing left with arms forward and hands in fists shifting weight to the right foot. With the left foot make three inward circles. Step forward with the left foot dragging the heel of the right foot forward. With the left foot make three outer circles. Step forward with the left foot heel, sliding the right foot forward. Do five jump steps forward while rolling the fists forward as at a punching bag. Shift your weight to face front. Strike the left side with backhand/bent arm. Pivot on the left heel. Slide right foot around and strike with the right hand. Pivot on the right heel. Slide left foot around and strike with the left hand.", "edited": 1631844470.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hd5npxu", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040815124526/home.tiscali.be/wim.degent/Notes/Horizon.html\"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20040815124526/home.tiscali.be/wim.degent/Notes/Horizon.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PULLING THE HORIZON - Omega 1995&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Raise the left arm straight to the side gazing over the top of the palm (exhaling).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;forcefully flip the palm and draw the heel toward the left shoulder(inhaling).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Repeat with the right arm&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Trace the edge of the left palm (palm up)over the solar plexus(finger pointing right) and turn 90 degrees, fingers up and trace edge of palm upward to the top of the chest then sweep the arm back behing the body and scooping, bring the edge of the palm to the side of the left pectoral (palm up). repeat with the right hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Twist the torso and bring the left hand to the extreme right/rear,palm down, and slowly sweep the horizon 360 degrees to the left following the fingertips with an unfocussed gaze on the horizon.\n-Scoop the palm back to the pectoral.\n-Repeat with the right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Repeat again with the right and hold the right arm at the rear while immediately sweeping again with the left 360 degrees from back to front, and scoop both arms simultaneously back to the pectorals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-shift the body 90 degrees to the right-right foot forward-hands into fists at chest level-palms down-right fist extended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-3 inward circles with right foot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Right fist rotates (reels) a small, full circle around the left while the right foot steps forward, plants and draws the body forward one step-left sole dragging the ground.

Repeat this scanning motion with the right hand, and when the right hand gets to the right side, as it scans the horizon in front, bring the left hand around from the back, as if following after the right hand. Bring the right hand to the back until the left hand catches up. Meanwhile, once the left hand gets to the right side, curve it around and scan the horizon from right to left. (These horizon scans should be very purposeful movements, without bending the wrist--only bend the elbow.) Scoop the left hand back in to the left side, and scoop the right hand in to the right side. Bring both hands back in to the waist, and make them into fists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(2) With all the weight on the left foot, shift the left heel slightly inward, so as to enable the body to turn to the right more easily. Take one step to the right and face right with the arms forward. Then make three small inward circles with the right foot, keeping the sole of the foot on the ground. Step forward with the right foot, dragging the heel of the left foot forward. Now make three outward small circles on the ground with the right foot. Step forward again with the right foot, the heel of the left foot sliding forward. Now take five &amp;quot;jump&amp;quot; steps, like a boxer, and while taking the steps, hit out with the fists circling around each other. (Think of a boxer pummeling a boxing bag.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(3) With the right fist strike out fast directly to your right (but don&amp;#39;t extend the arm fully). You should now be standing with the right arm extended to the right in a fist, and the left arm flexed in a fist over the middle of the upper chest. Now pivot the right heel to the right, bringing the left foot back, even with the right foot, still about one foot apart. At the same time strike out to the left with the left fist, bringing the right fist in to the upper chest. Then pivot with the left heel to the left, moving the right foot back, even with the left, and strike out with the right fist, at the same time bringing the left fist to the chest. Face front. Pivot on the right heel facing left with arms forward and hands in fists shifting weight to the right foot. With the left foot make three inward circles. Step forward with the left foot dragging the heel of the right foot forward. With the left foot make three outer circles. Step forward with the left foot heel, sliding the right foot forward. Do five jump steps forward while rolling the fists forward as at a punching bag. Shift your weight to face front. Strike the left side with backhand/bent arm. Pivot on the left heel. Slide right foot around and strike with the right hand. Pivot on the right heel. Slide left foot around and strike with the left hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_ppgg2m", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ppgg2m/pass_selector_update/hd5npxu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1631843868.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1631843868.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hd4hghc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hd4fzpl", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I'll look for it.\n\nI tried google images and was surprised to see, posts from here come up as often as still pictures of the Chacmools.\n\nI might have to start making sure google doesn't know who I am, so that the search results are not custom tailored to show reddit stuff.\n\nIt's great when stuff comes up explaining how it all works perfectly to produce magic.\n\nLily claims, it all had to go before it could be saved.  \n\nOr at least, it was likely her.\n\nI can't see Fancy caring about that.

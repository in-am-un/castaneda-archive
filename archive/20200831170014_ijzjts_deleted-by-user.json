It is just 7 damn bucks!)\n\nIn all other cases, do.\n\nAnd here's what you will see:\n\nYou will see Carlos' inner circle guys - Tony, Renata and Bruce. \n\nRenata speaking as usual in her new ageish style about his tradition and telling stories from her apprenticeship. But she is not annoying to listen.\n\nBruce as usual speaking abstractly about his wow apprenticeship. Sometimes annoying to listen.\n\nAnd Tony, kinda controversial. Some really amazing facts and nice ideas, and at the same time I was surprised to hear from him how Carlos was using women sexually with no benefit to them, or that Tensegrity has nothing to do with Mexican tradition and is a kung fu made on top of Howard's techniques to solve Carloses personal health issues.

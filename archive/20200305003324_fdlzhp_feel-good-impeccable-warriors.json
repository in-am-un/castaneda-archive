I hate that this is true, but sorcery is all about feelings.  Not about silence.\n\nBut, you won't be able to see that until you can easily step into another world without any preparation.\n\nIt's the realization that there's no procedures at all.  You go where you feel you can go.\n\nIf your feelings are serene, you can go more places.\n\nBut in the meantime, recap activates the second attention because you sit there with eyes closed, breathing smoothly, turn your head like you are gazing, and visualize past memories.\n\nHow could that NOT wake up the second attention???  \n\nIf that\u2019s not obvious to anyone, you need to spend some time on the Simple Silence Technique, until you KNOW what the second attention is, for sure.\n\nThere\u2019s no excuse for anyone to have questions about what the assemblage point is, and what the second attention is.  Those are trivial to learn.\n\nAlso, by remembering those past events, you light up those long dormant emanations.\n\nYou can\u2019t remember or think about or perceive ANYTHING, unless it\u2019s in the range of your assemblage point.\n\nMoving it around all over the place like that makes the assemblage point more flexible.\n\n It's lit up past positions again, so your assemblage point can slide over there more easily.\n\nIt\u2019s like cleaning trash out the tidepools in Laguna.\n\nWater begins to flow to spots that had become stagnant.\n\nAt the max, you can feel your entire life as a big web in front of you.  Each point is a place of activity you can recall.\n\n(((2.\n\nYou get back the energy you lost over there.  You're stuck there.  That will keep you from changing worlds easily.\n\nA good analogy would be Gulliver's Travels. None of those tiny ropes could hold him down on the beach.  But dozens of them could.\n\n(((3. \n\nI like to stay out of that argument. As Carlos would have said, it's in the realm of \"mental masturbation\".  \n\nPeople like to flatter themselves, in the absence of any real experiences, by imagining this thing, or that thing they did, was the 3rd attention.\n\nHow did they pick that to obsess over?\n\nYou can find out if you have a 4 year old around. Tell them to NEVER go near the furnace, and see what happens.\n\nSo they found the coolest, most dangerous thing, and are pacifying their mind thinking about it, instead of sitting in a chair learning to be silent.\n\nWhile you\u2019re at it, why not imagine you have as much money as Michael Bloomberg?\n\nSpeaking of masturbation, here's the deal on sex.  I didn\u2019t explain this clearly before, because Carlos never did.\n\nBut I keep getting asked.\n\nMen probably don't lose energy, having sex with women.  I suspect that they gain energy.\n\nAssuming of course, there's no child.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t know for sure, because Carlos made me celibate so long ago that I wasn\u2019t able to detect that last time I had sex.  \n\nBut Cholita teases me once in a blue moon, and the effect greatly helps my darkness gazing.\n\nBeing a witch, Cholita can dole out sexual energy, one touch at a time.\n\nUnfortunately, men are stupid. The sexual energy becomes like candy, to keep them coming back.\n\nThen most women will figure out how to re-purpose them.   \n\nSex is the wind up key for their biologically (or socially) programmed controlling behavior.\n\nIt could explain why Carlos didn\u2019t discourage orgies in Cleargreen.\n\nIt broke up the controlling behavior.\n\nBut one on one, you gave them permission to control you, once you have sex.\n\nAlso, the energy gained will completely change your course at the deepest level.\n\nSo, a male with an active sex life won't be able to practice enough to learn sorcery. And if they manage to do it anyway, everything gets constantly scrambled.\n\nIf it\u2019s a witch like Cholita, that might work out.  But if it\u2019s your fussy girl next door, you\u2019re screwed.  They\u2019re headed towards misery, and nothing is going to stop them from dragging you along for company.\n\nWomen lose energy from sex, I guess, although Cholita insists **she** doesn't.\n\nI\u2019ve seen the worms in them. It\u2019s not the kind of sight you believe when you see it, but there it is.  It\u2019s what Carlos described.\n\nIf he hadn\u2019t, I wonder what I would have seen?  \n\nNo way to tell.\n\nMasturbation on the other hand, simply uses up all of your time.  \n\nAnd since Sex with women isn't a loss for men, why would masturbation be?\n\nLet's put aside that going without sex can produce disturbing dreams, which can lead to lucidity.\n\nIt may be true, but I doubt anyone's ever made good use of that.  It's just too messy in dreaming, to solve it one way.\n\nThe real problem almost certainly is, single men will do that for hours if they can get away with it. And typically enhance it with substances.\n\nThere\u2019s a dirty little secret for alcohol addicts.  I learned about it because the double woman I found had to go to court ordered rehab.  She had 6 or 8 drinks, some cocaine, someone peed on her plastic pink flamingo, so she decided to outrun the police in her convertible.\n\nIt made sense at the time.  Especially since not too long before, the police had to visit her. They ended up taking pictures next to her and Zelia (imported as a playmate for Jenna, from Taiwan) in their bikinis.\n\nSo I dutifully drove her everywhere until she got her license back a year later.  And that included rehab.\n\nThe alcoholics are nearly always using pot or something else.  And when they hole up in a hotel room getting drunk for days, they\u2019re masturbating. Or hookers.\n\nOne more warning about masturbation.  Carlos saw this as a big deal.\n\nMaybe because he didn\u2019t have xhamster, and was a former catholic, his view on this was a bit distorted.\n\nCertainly, if you ask the Japanese about his complaints they\u2019ll say, \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped.\u201d\n\nAt any rate, Carlos said that if you look at porn, you\u2019ll escalate.  \n\nI guess he was trying to set the record straight for the entire class. \n\nFrom experience???\n\nHe said, eventually you\u2019ll be looking at pictures of women being choked.\n\nTrouble is, women these days don\u2019t seem to mind that as long as it\u2019s relatively safe.\n\nMy double woman wanted to visit a bondage dungeon with me.  When I asked what was up with that, her other 3 friends said, \u201cHaven\u2019t you seen 50 shades?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the Milarepa effect.  That\u2019s where you\u2019re sitting in your cave, and demons visit to show you how they torture people in hell.\n\nIf Milarepa had xhamster in his cave, it would have been a lot gorier.\n\nEdited three times", "edited": 1583461639.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fjm18q4", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(((1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recap is all you actually need.

You go where you feel you can go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your feelings are serene, you can go more places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the meantime, recap activates the second attention because you sit there with eyes closed, breathing smoothly, turn your head like you are gazing, and visualize past memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How could that NOT wake up the second attention???  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that\u2019s not obvious to anyone, you need to spend some time on the Simple Silence Technique, until you KNOW what the second attention is, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s no excuse for anyone to have questions about what the assemblage point is, and what the second attention is.  Those are trivial to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, by remembering those past events, you light up those long dormant emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t remember or think about or perceive ANYTHING, unless it\u2019s in the range of your assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moving it around all over the place like that makes the assemblage point more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s lit up past positions again, so your assemblage point can slide over there more easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s like cleaning trash out the tidepools in Laguna.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Water begins to flow to spots that had become stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the max, you can feel your entire life as a big web in front of you.

But dozens of them could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(((3. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to stay out of that argument. As Carlos would have said, it&amp;#39;s in the realm of &amp;quot;mental masturbation&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People like to flatter themselves, in the absence of any real experiences, by imagining this thing, or that thing they did, was the 3rd attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did they pick that to obsess over?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find out if you have a 4 year old around. Tell them to NEVER go near the furnace, and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they found the coolest, most dangerous thing, and are pacifying their mind thinking about it, instead of sitting in a chair learning to be silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While you\u2019re at it, why not imagine you have as much money as Michael Bloomberg?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of masturbation, here&amp;#39;s the deal on sex.  I didn\u2019t explain this clearly before, because Carlos never did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I keep getting asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men probably don&amp;#39;t lose energy, having sex with women.  I suspect that they gain energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assuming of course, there&amp;#39;s no child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn\u2019t know for sure, because Carlos made me celibate so long ago that I wasn\u2019t able to detect that last time I had sex.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Cholita teases me once in a blue moon, and the effect greatly helps my darkness gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being a witch, Cholita can dole out sexual energy, one touch at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, men are stupid. The sexual energy becomes like candy, to keep them coming back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then most women will figure out how to re-purpose them.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sex is the wind up key for their biologically (or socially) programmed controlling behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could explain why Carlos didn\u2019t discourage orgies in Cleargreen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It broke up the controlling behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one on one, you gave them permission to control you, once you have sex.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the energy gained will completely change your course at the deepest level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, a male with an active sex life won&amp;#39;t be able to practice enough to learn sorcery.

I wasn't aware of it  until this subreddit.\n\nHe offered to sell me, Felix, and Corey his Pandora Compound.  I was assumed to provide the cash.\n\nHe gave me that half pear, the Chinese master departing disciple symbol.\n\nHe locked himself alone with me, weeks before he died, and had a talk about it.\n\nI was offered to be Florinda's lover.\n\nAnd I just found this.  Remember, I was down at Morongo when Carlos was down there.  But as a child.  I heard about him all the time, but it wasn't meaningful to me. And I was afraid of the Sorceress there.\n\nMy father was known to be a bit of a playboy. One of his girlfriends was rumored to be named \"Joanie\", but no one would say more about her.  A bit mixed up as I recall, and a little needy.\n\nAnd also, my dad's relationships with women were a bit like mine.  Not really all that sexual, more like fun company.  Cholita is a model for what happened to my father from time to time.\n\nMy dad helped set up Malki Museum at Morongo, which is pretty much were you'd end up \"hanging out\" if you went there as an anthropologist.  There was no casino yet.\n\nThe dreaming sorceress Ruby lived there, and the Devil's weed sorcerer John lived only a short walking distance away.\n\nI attended the festival there each year (don't eat the meat they'd warn me), and when my Father's book was filmed into a movie (Tell them Willieboy is here), I was shooting upskirt pics (by accident) of Kathrine Ross, one of the actresses.\n\nSomeone mentioned Carlos was there.\n\nWe also made fairly regular visits to Banning. I never understood why, we'd just go to someone's home and I'd wait around.\n\nHere's the credits for that movie, easy to find on the net\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n## Director:\n\nAbraham Polonsky\n\n## Writers:\n\nHarry Lawton (my father), Abraham Polonsky\n\n## Stars:\n\nRobert Redford, Katharine Ross, Robert Blake\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nCarlos loved to associate with Hollywood. I suspect it was part of his plan for creating factions.\n\nNot that any of this meant a thing to me at the time. I was an autistic kid.\n\nHere's what the Wanderling had to say about Joanie, Morongo, and the Festival:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFOOTNOTE \\[1\\]A woman by the name of Mary Joan (Joanie) Barker, often cited as Castaneda's girlfriend at the time, is the person that usually gets the lion's share of credit for originally taking Castaneda to the Morongo Indian Reservation near her childhood home of Banning, California.  The inference promulgated in Barker's home being near the Morongo Indian Reservation is that some sort of intimate connection had been established between herself and the Indians because of the proximity of her home --- say for example that she may have volunteered, rendered aid or assistance in some fashion over a period of time, or just hung out, thus being able to lay the groundwork for a long term mutual trust between herself and tribal members.  However, although not meant to discount any such prospects from having transpired on her part, except for attending an annual festival related to the Indians like almost anybody who lived in the area might, no proof or personal statements by Barker or associates has been forthcoming that substantiates any such actions, either long term or short term, involving Barker.    In any case, over and over Barker is reputed to be the person to have taken Castaneda to the reservation for the first time easing the pathway for him to meet a number of Cahuilla tribal members and spiritual elders including Salvador Lopez. Some say it was because of that introduction to Lopez that Castaneda obtained the information he used in his 1960s paper on datura.  The suggestion that Lopez or any Cahuilla tribal members was the source for Castaneda's datura information would automatically infer then, that the meeting or meetings would have to had occurred BEFORE the end of the spring semester of 1960 for any of the information gained to have been used in his paper.  Therein lays the rub. UCLA professor Douglass Price-Williams, a one-time member of Castaneda's dissertation committee and who counted himself as a friend of Castaneda --- not discouraging strong rumors to the effect by let standing in a low-key fashion that he may have played a part in the initial meeting between Barker and Castaneda --- has been quoted as saying Barker was a librarian at UCLA sometime in the summer of 1960 and it was during that summer, July or August of 1960, that Castaneda and Barker met.

I wasn&amp;#39;t aware of it  until this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He offered to sell me, Felix, and Corey his Pandora Compound.  I was assumed to provide the cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gave me that half pear, the Chinese master departing disciple symbol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He locked himself alone with me, weeks before he died, and had a talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was offered to be Florinda&amp;#39;s lover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I just found this.  Remember, I was down at Morongo when Carlos was down there.  But as a child.  I heard about him all the time, but it wasn&amp;#39;t meaningful to me. And I was afraid of the Sorceress there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father was known to be a bit of a playboy. One of his girlfriends was rumored to be named &amp;quot;Joanie&amp;quot;, but no one would say more about her.  A bit mixed up as I recall, and a little needy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also, my dad&amp;#39;s relationships with women were a bit like mine.  Not really all that sexual, more like fun company.  Cholita is a model for what happened to my father from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad helped set up Malki Museum at Morongo, which is pretty much were you&amp;#39;d end up &amp;quot;hanging out&amp;quot; if you went there as an anthropologist.  There was no casino yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dreaming sorceress Ruby lived there, and the Devil&amp;#39;s weed sorcerer John lived only a short walking distance away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I attended the festival there each year (don&amp;#39;t eat the meat they&amp;#39;d warn me), and when my Father&amp;#39;s book was filmed into a movie (Tell them Willieboy is here), I was shooting upskirt pics (by accident) of Kathrine Ross, one of the actresses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone mentioned Carlos was there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also made fairly regular visits to Banning. I never understood why, we&amp;#39;d just go to someone&amp;#39;s home and I&amp;#39;d wait around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the credits for that movie, easy to find on the net&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*****************&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Director:&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abraham Polonsky&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Writers:&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harry Lawton (my father), Abraham Polonsky&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Stars:&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert Redford, Katharine Ross, Robert Blake&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;************&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos loved to associate with Hollywood. I suspect it was part of his plan for creating factions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that any of this meant a thing to me at the time. I was an autistic kid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what the Wanderling had to say about Joanie, Morongo, and the Festival:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**************&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FOOTNOTE [1]A woman by the name of Mary Joan (Joanie) Barker, often cited as Castaneda&amp;#39;s girlfriend at the time, is the person that usually gets the lion&amp;#39;s share of credit for originally taking Castaneda to the Morongo Indian Reservation near her childhood home of Banning, California.  The inference promulgated in Barker&amp;#39;s home being near the Morongo Indian Reservation is that some sort of intimate connection had been established between herself and the Indians because of the proximity of her home --- say for example that she may have volunteered, rendered aid or assistance in some fashion over a period of time, or just hung out, thus being able to lay the groundwork for a long term mutual trust between herself and tribal members.  However, although not meant to discount any such prospects from having transpired on her part, except for attending an annual festival related to the Indians like almost anybody who lived in the area might, no proof or personal statements by Barker or associates has been forthcoming that substantiates any such actions, either long term or short term, involving Barker.    In any case, over and over Barker is reputed to be the person to have taken Castaneda to the reservation for the first time easing the pathway for him to meet a number of Cahuilla tribal members and spiritual elders including Salvador Lopez. Some say it was because of that introduction to Lopez that Castaneda obtained the information he used in his 1960s paper on datura.  The suggestion that Lopez or any Cahuilla tribal members was the source for Castaneda&amp;#39;s datura information would automatically infer then, that the meeting or meetings would have to had occurred BEFORE the end of the spring semester of 1960 for any of the information gained to have been used in his paper.  Therein lays the rub. UCLA professor Douglass Price-Williams, a one-time member of Castaneda&amp;#39;s dissertation committee and who counted himself as a friend of Castaneda --- not discouraging strong rumors to the effect by let standing in a low-key fashion that he may have played a part in the initial meeting between Barker and Castaneda --- has been quoted as saying Barker was a librarian at UCLA sometime in the summer of 1960 and it was during that summer, July or August of 1960, that Castaneda and Barker met. If such was the case, any introduction by her involving Castaneda and the Cahuillas or Lopez would have transpired AFTER his paper was turned in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*************&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only report what happens.

No scandal, no behavior out of line with being a sorcerer.\n\nI get hell over Cholita from everyone who knows me.  That\u2019s just how things are in the world of sorcery. Once you stop chasing happiness and follow intent, and the relationships that produces, everyone around you tries to put a stop to it.\n\nDon Juan blew his group up with suspicions and paranoia.  The apprentices even ended up trying to kill each other.  One account says they succeeded.\n\nCarlos was supposed to go gather them back together, according to the myth.  The Nagual blows it up, and the new Nagual has to salvage what he can.\n\nThat makes the new Nagual even stronger, because he had to earn the right to have sorcery companions, and he's going to work even harder to keep it going.\n\nYou don't want a, \"Yea man, whatever...\" sorcerer leading a group.\n\nSome of my compatriots are like that. Just go out there and read what they're up to.\n\nThey would be a disaster for what Carlos was trying to do: keep his knowledge intact.\n\nIt\u2019s the same here as it was with the rule of the Eagle's Gift.\n\nI just got stuck with the miserable task. I waited a long time hoping someone else would do it, but no one stepped forward.\n\nWhich is not so surprising, considering all the symbolism Carlos put into my interactions with him. He marked me for the task.  \n\nI don\u2019t know if others got marked too, but they aren\u2019t around so it doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\nIt makes a lot of sense to blow it up, when the Nagual leaves.  There was a lot of dead weight in that large group.\n\nThe dead weight will go away, and only those wanting to fight will remain.\n\nIt also gives everyone a chance at doing what they wanted.\n\nCholita for example, only wants a husband and an ordinary life. And Whole Foods, and the LA night life.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty darned nice!  It\u2019s a good thing she despises me, or I might enjoy too much of that also.\n\nMost of the women I've contacted went back to their ordinary lives, and are tweeting pics of cute child relatives.\n\nOr they\u2019re trying to save the world by burning it down (angry politics)\n\nCarlos also (did anyone notice?) left the Nagual woman to help the apprentices who remained active.\n\nAnd Carol Tiggs does just that, with visits and communication to Reni and Cleargreen.\n\nThat's part of the myth!  In Carlos' case, it was Florinda Matus who remained behind, to perfect his stalking skills.\n\nAnd low and behold, what is cleargreen doing?  Heading in the direction of stalking.  \n\nIt's the kind of stalking that gives me indigestion, but I'm pretty stiff.  Who knows what their understanding of it has become?\n\nThe other witches (Flo, Taisha, and their guard Kylie) had no responsibility to do that, so they're really hard to find. Or gone. Who knows?\n\nI might have gone with them too, when Corey advised me I could be Florinda's lover.  But I ended up remaining, and got Cholita instead.  \n\nAs for Cleargreen, Carlos wasn't willing to destroy it.  \n\nHe was leaving. He didn't find a replacement.  So there wasn't much he could do, but let it go.\n\nHe had to be settled on his obligations here.  We put in all that time recapitulating and paying back debts.  \n\nYou can't afford to blow all that work by clinging to something you can't control.\n\nI should say, \"Rosebud!!!\" at this point, to show how pointless it is to cling to things.\n\nSo he said, when Ellis asked, he didn\u2019t care what happened to Cleargreen.  And he knew for sure, Ellis would write that down and put it into a book.\n\nCarlos was a master manipulator! He had 2 writers in his group he knew would keep it up.\n\nEllis with her contrary books, and me with my Nagualist newsletter, which I only stopped at Carlos' request.\n\nHe had to know I'd resume that eventually.  After Ellis did her job.\n\nCleargreen wasn't really abandoned.  They still had a legal foundation to profit from his books and videos, and had the sole right to teach tensegrity.\n\nSo, the slackers there would come to depend entirely on that income, which would make them work harder to spread Tensegrity.\n\nJust what Carlos wanted.\n\nPart of sorcery, perhaps the most important part, is to jump.  To commit to something utterly stupid, which has the goal of magic.\n\nIt beckons intent.\n\nThat\u2019s still going on to this day. When I go to a YouTube tensegrity video (usually because Cholita saw it), and add an encouraging comment, I always get people writing to me, excited to see they aren\u2019t wasting their time.\n\nAnd now we have Tensegrity Facilitators.  Eastern Bloc too!  \n\nThe heart of old magical cults.\n\nThey\u2019re more serious about results than Americans are.  \n\nContrast an American Wiccan\u2019s spells, with those of a Necromancer Russian Witch.\n\nNo comparison.  There\u2019s power in what the Russian witches do.  They materialize demons and go to graveyards, to work their magic.\n\nThey're looking for dark energy.\n\nCholita goes to the crystal store.\n\nThe Wiccans mostly just want to feel better.\n\nRussian witches want REVENGE.\n\nJust like La Catalina!\n\nNo one knows what will happen for sure, but it looks to me like Carlos pulled off a magical maneuver.\n\nHollywood has even been infected with his sorcery.\n\nEdited four times", "edited": 1584381303.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fknxxwc", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the myth, sorcerers always blow up their apprentices when they leave.

And he knew for sure, Ellis would write that down and put it into a book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was a master manipulator! He had 2 writers in his group he knew would keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellis with her contrary books, and me with my Nagualist newsletter, which I only stopped at Carlos&amp;#39; request.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had to know I&amp;#39;d resume that eventually.  After Ellis did her job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cleargreen wasn&amp;#39;t really abandoned.  They still had a legal foundation to profit from his books and videos, and had the sole right to teach tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the slackers there would come to depend entirely on that income, which would make them work harder to spread Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just what Carlos wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of sorcery, perhaps the most important part, is to jump.  To commit to something utterly stupid, which has the goal of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It beckons intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s still going on to this day. When I go to a YouTube tensegrity video (usually because Cholita saw it), and add an encouraging comment, I always get people writing to me, excited to see they aren\u2019t wasting their time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now we have Tensegrity Facilitators.  Eastern Bloc too!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The heart of old magical cults.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They\u2019re more serious about results than Americans are.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contrast an American Wiccan\u2019s spells, with those of a Necromancer Russian Witch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No comparison.  There\u2019s power in what the Russian witches do.  They materialize demons and go to graveyards, to work their magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re looking for dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita goes to the crystal store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Wiccans mostly just want to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Russian witches want REVENGE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like La Catalina!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one knows what will happen for sure, but it looks to me like Carlos pulled off a magical maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hollywood has even been infected with his sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited four times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/fdlzhp/feelgood_impeccable_warriors/fknxxwc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1584376193.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_fdlzhp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fkn1qhn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "calixto_mooneeeee", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1584349430.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fkljjis", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_5kwod04j", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I thought Carlos was interested in making people progress in seeing and put a lot of efforts in it, doing workshops, private classes etc. why he must be willing to destroy his creation (Cleargreen) if it aim was to share the knowledge capable of changing the people's life?

As don Juan said:\n\nDon Juan said that after centuries of dealing with power plants, some of these men had finally  learned to see. The most enterprising of them then began to teach other men of knowledge  how to see. And that was the beginning of their end. As time passed, the number of seers  increased, but their obsession with what they saw, which filled them with reverence and fear,  became so intense that they ceased to be men of knowledge. They became extraordinarily  proficient in seeing and could exert great control over the strange worlds they were witnessing.  But it was to no avail. Seeing had undermined their strength and forced them to be obsessed  with what they saw.\n\n\"There were seers, however, who escaped that fate,\" don Juan continued, \"great men who, in  spite of their seeing, never ceased to be men of knowledge. Some of them endeavored to use  seeing positively, and to teach it to their fellow men. I'm convinced that under their direction,  the populations of entire cities went into other worlds and never came back.\n\n\"But the seers who could only see were fiascos, and when the land where they lived was  invaded by a conquering people, they were as defenseless as everyone else.\n\n\"Those conquerors,\" he went on, \"took over the Toltec world. They appropriated everything,  but they never learned to see.\"'\n\n(Note: \"Toltec\" here just means people practicing our form of magic, living in a vast area from Mexico City to Veracruz.  Don Juan explains that elsewhere, when Carlos is confused on that point.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g7rdo3z64hqc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28cea9585a59b32d37a46495d088caf50845aa90", "edited": 1711369885.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kwh5mxl", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT made this picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phantom views assembling in your darkroom become more and more common, as you approach Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s even possible there, to &amp;quot;train&amp;quot; a Tensegrity form to produce a reliable phantom reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like this one.

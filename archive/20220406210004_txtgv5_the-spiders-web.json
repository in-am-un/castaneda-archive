Remember, they were forced in there as a substitute for hunting and gathering all over the southern part of California.\n\nMostly acorns I believe, but lots of chia and fish.\n\nThey ground the chia with water, spread it on rocks in the sun, and made \"Manna\".\n\nFlake bread.  That's why it's in the bible.  It's a very old form of bread, which is naturally discovered by anyone who grinds up seeds for food, on bounders with grinding stones.  And then tries to wash off the flour.  Don't rinse well, and you get little flakes where you were washing.\n\nThat coordinate would likely be where Ruby told me there used to be men like don Juan, all over the valley near the museum.  I bet if I were standing at the main road to the museum, your place would be in view ahead.\n\nBut I'm not certain of that.  Like I said, I was only 12.\n\nThe \"dreamcatcher\" road there confirms what I suspected.\n\nCarlos had \"contaminated\" the indians on the reservation.\n\nColored their understanding of their own religion.\n\nWhich was \"fading fast\" at the time I was there.\n\nAnthropologists considered it an \"emergency\" situation.\n\nThey tried to save as much as they could, especially of their languages.\n\nThere are 3 tribes there, as far as I recall.\n\nSo the non-Luiseno likely got the most intense \"studying\".\n\nThe Cahuilla in particular.\n\nYou might be able to find the entrance to heaven, if you did a good  job of looking around.\n\nSomeone showed me once.\n\nIt's an old dry lake bed, which I was told by the guide, is not always dry.\n\nMy father was trying to prove that the indians weren't so stupid, before europeans took over, that they didn't know how to water plants.\n\nIt's been so long, it's hard to remember.\n\nBut I believe he was trying to grow mini corn without watering it, at Mountain Center.\n\nIt didn't survive.\n\nBut he found some very old corn cobs in caves, so he didn't give up.  400 years old corn was it?\n\nThe older anthropologist who dominate the UC System at the time, had scoffed at the idea the indians had agriculture.\n\nRemember that horticulture is not quite the same thing.\n\nAnd he insisted, and everyone had to obey, that they didn't have agriculture.\n\nBut eventually it turned out, they were irrigating an entire valley and that's part of the reason the europeans invaded and took over their lands.\n\nThey came in with their cattle and said, \"Oh!!! Look at all this lovely grazing land!\"\n\nNaturally that didn't go over well.\n\nKeep in mind, the Luiseno were boat people.  No horses until recently.\n\nThey went up and down the coast in some kind of boats or canoes they made.\n\nAnd after anthropologists asked around for potential indian names for the tools used in irrigating the whole valley, it turned out the name for an irrigation pole, was the same as the word for an oar, for their boats.\n\nSo it's a good reason to preserve native american languages where possible, because it helps when you find a very old site at which to dig, and want to understand what's going on.\n\nBut back to Mountain Center.\n\nI believe there's some outrageous natural water sources back in the hills.\n\nLike I said, I was only 12, but i clearly remember more than 1 very long \"trough\" filled with pure water, coming down from the mountain.\n\nIt was in the center of a little canyon of sorts, and you could fit 200 horses along the sides of it, with all drinking at the same time.\n\nI never managed to walk all the way to the source.  I was shown where, but at one point you had to climb a bit, through a narrow and very rocky gully.\n\nWish I knew the name of those watering stations. They're worth visiting.\n\nAlso.   I probably shouldn't say this.\n\nThe sorcerers who lived there are not completely \"gone\".\n\nYou can see them with your own eyes.\n\nBut it doesn't seem to be possible to alter their timeline anymore.\n\nThe same way don Juan took Carlos to the big rock, to meet the old seers who buried themselves there, you can do something similar at locations down there.\n\nIf I could live another 50 years, I'd map them out so others can visit.\n\nWe could name them!\n\nPala Paul the Pot maker\n\nRincon Rick the Rock painter\n\nWhy they still linger, I don't know.\n\nCheck this out:\n\nPre-Contact (10,000+ Years Ago)\n\nGroups of people now known as Luise\u00f1o Indians have inhabited the Temecula Valley for thousands of years.  We call ourselves Pay\u00f3mkawichum (the People of the West), and we are made up of seven bands: Pechanga, Pauma, Pala, Rincon, San Luis Rey, La Jolla, and Soboba.

Remember, they were forced in there as a substitute for hunting and gathering all over the southern part of California.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mostly acorns I believe, but lots of chia and fish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They ground the chia with water, spread it on rocks in the sun, and made &amp;quot;Manna&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flake bread.  That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s in the bible.  It&amp;#39;s a very old form of bread, which is naturally discovered by anyone who grinds up seeds for food, on bounders with grinding stones.  And then tries to wash off the flour.  Don&amp;#39;t rinse well, and you get little flakes where you were washing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That coordinate would likely be where Ruby told me there used to be men like don Juan, all over the valley near the museum.  I bet if I were standing at the main road to the museum, your place would be in view ahead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m not certain of that.  Like I said, I was only 12.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;dreamcatcher&amp;quot; road there confirms what I suspected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had &amp;quot;contaminated&amp;quot; the indians on the reservation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Colored their understanding of their own religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was &amp;quot;fading fast&amp;quot; at the time I was there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropologists considered it an &amp;quot;emergency&amp;quot; situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They tried to save as much as they could, especially of their languages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are 3 tribes there, as far as I recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the non-Luiseno likely got the most intense &amp;quot;studying&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Cahuilla in particular.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might be able to find the entrance to heaven, if you did a good  job of looking around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone showed me once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an old dry lake bed, which I was told by the guide, is not always dry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father was trying to prove that the indians weren&amp;#39;t so stupid, before europeans took over, that they didn&amp;#39;t know how to water plants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been so long, it&amp;#39;s hard to remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I believe he was trying to grow mini corn without watering it, at Mountain Center.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t survive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he found some very old corn cobs in caves, so he didn&amp;#39;t give up.  400 years old corn was it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The older anthropologist who dominate the UC System at the time, had scoffed at the idea the indians had agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember that horticulture is not quite the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he insisted, and everyone had to obey, that they didn&amp;#39;t have agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But eventually it turned out, they were irrigating an entire valley and that&amp;#39;s part of the reason the europeans invaded and took over their lands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They came in with their cattle and said, &amp;quot;Oh!!! Look at all this lovely grazing land!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally that didn&amp;#39;t go over well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, the Luiseno were boat people.  No horses until recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They went up and down the coast in some kind of boats or canoes they made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And after anthropologists asked around for potential indian names for the tools used in irrigating the whole valley, it turned out the name for an irrigation pole, was the same as the word for an oar, for their boats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s a good reason to preserve native american languages where possible, because it helps when you find a very old site at which to dig, and want to understand what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But back to Mountain Center.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe there&amp;#39;s some outrageous natural water sources back in the hills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I was only 12, but i clearly remember more than 1 very long &amp;quot;trough&amp;quot; filled with pure water, coming down from the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was in the center of a little canyon of sorts, and you could fit 200 horses along the sides of it, with all drinking at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never managed to walk all the way to the source.  I was shown where, but at one point you had to climb a bit, through a narrow and very rocky gully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wish I knew the name of those watering stations. They&amp;#39;re worth visiting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also.   I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t say this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sorcerers who lived there are not completely &amp;quot;gone&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see them with your own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be possible to alter their timeline anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same way don Juan took Carlos to the big rock, to meet the old seers who buried themselves there, you can do something similar at locations down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I could live another 50 years, I&amp;#39;d map them out so others can visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could name them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pala Paul the Pot maker&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rincon Rick the Rock painter&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why they still linger, I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check this out:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pre-Contact (10,000+ Years Ago)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Groups of people now known as Luise\u00f1o Indians have inhabited the Temecula Valley for thousands of years.  We call ourselves Pay\u00f3mkawichum (the People of the West), and we are made up of seven bands: Pechanga, Pauma, Pala, Rincon, San Luis Rey, La Jolla, and Soboba. Evidence of our presence before the arrival of Europeans survives throughout the valley. Bedrock mortars, stone tools, pottery, and rock art are still found in Riverside and San Diego Counties.

I\u2019ve done so much research about this area. But there\u2019s really not too much on google. Like the backroad on the morongo reservation. It leads up the hills but on the maps I see a bunch of holes. And looks like a bunch of small ponds.

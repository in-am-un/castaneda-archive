You realize it's manipulative.  And not good for them either.\n\nSo self-pity won't go down well in here. Even when \"hidden\" in sarcasm.\n\nA single statement like that used to get people kicked out of private classes with Carlos.\n\nSometimes overnight, from just one remark!\n\nA woman once received a gift of shoes from one of the witches, clothing gifts being traditional and symbolic of a link between the two people.\n\nOn seeing the shoes the woman said, \"I can't wear those!\"\n\nShe was gone so fast, her head spun.\n\nMy witch enemy Cholita chuckled as she told me the story, because she was there when it happened.\n\nThe shoes were a magical gift, but she wasn't actually interested in magic at all. Mostly she just wanted to be in the \"inner circle\", and hang around the famous people.\n\nAnd she made it clear with that statement.\n\nI didn't watch all the Star Wars cartoons, so I must have missed the witches.\n\nOr maybe they were in paper publications.\n\nIn our system, we have both witches and seers.\n\nWe like to call seers \"sorcerers\", but that's not quite right.\n\nSorcerers are interested in \"practical magic\" mostly.\n\nWhich darkroom has plenty of!\n\nYou can walk through solid walls, travel to the homeworld of spirits to learn from them (in your physical body, we don't pretend with meditation and closed eyes), share dreams with someone else of that skill level, levitate light objects, be in 2 places at once, leap to distant planets outside our galaxy, manufacture entire phantom cities you can live in out of thin air, and so on.\n\nToo much potential practical magic to even list it all, but it's \"gifted\" to you one experience at a time if you're working seriously.\n\nPerhaps 2 weeks between \"gifts\" of a significant nature if you never miss practicing each night.\n\nNone of which you can repeat, but then the next gift is something new so you quickly figure out \"infinity\" has taken over teaching you, based on how sorcerers learned in the past.\n\nOne experience at a time, created by your teacher.\n\nSo that even when you have no actual teacher, it goes that way just because it did before.\n\nIt's repeating stuff for you.\n\nThus you have to be very careful what you \"want\", or you won't get it to repeat sorcery lessons.\n\nIt'll figure out what you REALLY want, and even if it's total shit that's what you'll get.\n\nThus Carlos even used to make people show some big effort by having women cut their hair short, or do some other obviously unpleasant thing they didn't want to do, to prove they were serious.\n\nUnless he could see the person was serious from the start.\n\nIn that case, he bent over backwards to keep them practicing.\n\nHe did that for me.\n\nBut my witch enemy Cholita, got the hard treatment. He gave her a list of things she had to do, to get into private classes.\n\nDespite all the potential cool \"practical magic\",  *seers* only want to see the source of it all, mostly so they can figure out how to keep their awareness past death.\n\nWe've done all of those things I mentioned, other than live past death. So don't think those come from some sacred scroll only the high ups have access to.\n\nAnything like that is total make believe.\n\nWe do what we say, and very often. Not once, and then we get a little throne to sit on like meditation systems do.\n\nSo \"immortality\" doesn't seem like a good goal to me, because it gets too religious and can lead to odd \"inventory item\" collecting behavior.\n\nWhere you memorize sacred precepts, and have them tattooed on your back like Rinpoche Buddhists do for the prostitutes they control in Bangkok.\n\nEven our own Castaneda fans start behaving like that, if someone doesn't snap them out of it.  50 years of that kind of behavior went by, before this subreddit rose up to try to fix it.\n\nUkraine has a large population of Castaneda fans who seem to think this is a religion.\n\nJust follow orders, worship the right people such as Reni or Carlos, and they'll lead you across a bridge to a giant dome where you can keep your awareness contained after death.\n\nNot a good goal if you ask me since it encourages laziness.\n\nThe #1 enemy of someone wanting to learn sorcery, is not fear as is written in the early books.\n\nFear is a big problem, once you have real spirits threatening you during practice.\n\nBut the actual #1 problem is laziness, and unwillingness to give up the little free time we all have, while working full time jobs.\n\nI not only work a full time job, but get up at 3AM so I can work on things for this subreddit.\n\nThus, I don't like to see people who aren't serious, wasting our efforts.\n\nThe last thing they need is \"encouraging words\".\n\nA kick in the butt is more like it, when it's obvious someone is being lazy and sloppy.", "edited": 1695319663.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_k1lgopk", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A self-pity appeal there?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery moves your assemblage point to &amp;quot;the place of no pity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For yourself, not for others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, once you realize that humans spend all day long feeling sorry for themselves, you don&amp;#39;t like to run up against it in others.

Mostly she just wanted to be in the &amp;quot;inner circle&amp;quot;, and hang around the famous people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she made it clear with that statement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t watch all the Star Wars cartoons, so I must have missed the witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe they were in paper publications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our system, we have both witches and seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We like to call seers &amp;quot;sorcerers&amp;quot;, but that&amp;#39;s not quite right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers are interested in &amp;quot;practical magic&amp;quot; mostly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which darkroom has plenty of!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can walk through solid walls, travel to the homeworld of spirits to learn from them (in your physical body, we don&amp;#39;t pretend with meditation and closed eyes), share dreams with someone else of that skill level, levitate light objects, be in 2 places at once, leap to distant planets outside our galaxy, manufacture entire phantom cities you can live in out of thin air, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too much potential practical magic to even list it all, but it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;gifted&amp;quot; to you one experience at a time if you&amp;#39;re working seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps 2 weeks between &amp;quot;gifts&amp;quot; of a significant nature if you never miss practicing each night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of which you can repeat, but then the next gift is something new so you quickly figure out &amp;quot;infinity&amp;quot; has taken over teaching you, based on how sorcerers learned in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One experience at a time, created by your teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that even when you have no actual teacher, it goes that way just because it did before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s repeating stuff for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus you have to be very careful what you &amp;quot;want&amp;quot;, or you won&amp;#39;t get it to repeat sorcery lessons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll figure out what you REALLY want, and even if it&amp;#39;s total shit that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;ll get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus Carlos even used to make people show some big effort by having women cut their hair short, or do some other obviously unpleasant thing they didn&amp;#39;t want to do, to prove they were serious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless he could see the person was serious from the start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that case, he bent over backwards to keep them practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did that for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my witch enemy Cholita, got the hard treatment. He gave her a list of things she had to do, to get into private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite all the potential cool &amp;quot;practical magic&amp;quot;,  &lt;em&gt;seers&lt;/em&gt; only want to see the source of it all, mostly so they can figure out how to keep their awareness past death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve done all of those things I mentioned, other than live past death. So don&amp;#39;t think those come from some sacred scroll only the high ups have access to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything like that is total make believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do what we say, and very often. Not once, and then we get a little throne to sit on like meditation systems do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;immortality&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a good goal to me, because it gets too religious and can lead to odd &amp;quot;inventory item&amp;quot; collecting behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you memorize sacred precepts, and have them tattooed on your back like Rinpoche Buddhists do for the prostitutes they control in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even our own Castaneda fans start behaving like that, if someone doesn&amp;#39;t snap them out of it.  50 years of that kind of behavior went by, before this subreddit rose up to try to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has a large population of Castaneda fans who seem to think this is a religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just follow orders, worship the right people such as Reni or Carlos, and they&amp;#39;ll lead you across a bridge to a giant dome where you can keep your awareness contained after death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a good goal if you ask me since it encourages laziness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The #1 enemy of someone wanting to learn sorcery, is not fear as is written in the early books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fear is a big problem, once you have real spirits threatening you during practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the actual #1 problem is laziness, and unwillingness to give up the little free time we all have, while working full time jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I not only work a full time job, but get up at 3AM so I can work on things for this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, I don&amp;#39;t like to see people who aren&amp;#39;t serious, wasting our efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last thing they need is &amp;quot;encouraging words&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A kick in the butt is more like it, when it&amp;#39;s obvious someone is being lazy and sloppy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_16nsay9", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/16nsay9/beginner_with_darkroom_am_i_doing_it_right/k1lgopk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1695319224.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1695319224.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k1ksls1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "IntelligentCow626", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_k1k7lrm", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_gb0l5m0cs", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Thanks for the encouraging words.

It's a pipe dream.\n\nNot going to help at all.\n\nAnd in fact it never helped in the books.\n\nIf you read them all, and understand the context.\n\nCarlos was being taught in secret, with the Nagual's blow.\n\nI hope you read past the first 4, to realize those were all just a trick to keep him around, while they taught him in secret.  And to satisfy his request for a \"genuine indian informant on the use of hallucinogenic plants\".\n\nAll the rage in anthropology in the early 60s!\n\nSo don Juan gave him a masterful lesson, no scholar who ever lived could have given him.\n\nBut it was all a trick just to get him to stick around.  None of that was much help to someone who wants to learn for real.\n\nAnd Carloso had don Juan with him when he was running around to \"power spots\".\n\nMostly just don Juan intending him to expect things to work.\n\nVery little came from the \"power spot\".\n\nEven when he wandered off on his own and \"stopped the world\", he had little smoke the Ally, following him. Under orders from don Juan.\n\nThe talking coyote is what helped him stop the world. Not wandering off into the wilderness.\n\nYou make power spots yourself, the way Silvio Manual could do, when you get good at darkroom.\n\nAlso, you're looking for the wrong stuff and didn't mention doing any tensegrity.\n\nThere's no reason for the purple puffs to show up, if you aren't entertaining to them.  Those are sentient pieces of your double.\n\nNormally they can't stand your grief and self-pity obsessed physical version, so they flee.\n\nYou have to do something different, to get their attention.\n\nTensegrity in darkness will lure them out once you can stop focusing on everything you're thinking about.\n\nLessen the grief and self-pity, while doing tensegrity, and those purple puffs will notice it.  And come visiting.\n\nSo my guess is that you've fallen into the \"looking for your greatness\" thing beginners do, which is usually a sign they'll never learn because they aren't in fact actually trying, but want us to think they are.\n\nAsk yourself an honest question.\n\nKeep in mind that people need food, and shelter.\n\nOnce they have those, they can focus on one more thing.\n\nMost will select fame and attention seeking from other humans.\n\nBut some are nerds, and focus on learning and understanding their situation.\n\nThus do you seek attention from others, for being a \"sorcerer\"?\n\nI could look at your reddit history to figure that out, unless you made a new user ID.\n\nOr do you just want to \"know\"?  And any interest in fame and attention from others is minor?\n\nIf it's the first reason, you've got 10 years before that might ever change. You'd have to realize the pointlessness of being famous.\n\nHow long does that take someone?\n\nI don't know, but 10 years might be a reasonable minimum.\n\nFor sorcery, you have to REALLY want to learn, just because you want to learn, and for no other significant reason.\n\nAnd, you have to follow the instructions exactly, and not skip anything because it's too much trouble.\n\nThere's reasons for the instructions, which beginners can't possibly fathom.\n\nThe same is true of \"Art of Dreaming\" steps.\n\nNo one ever follows them!\n\nBut they're cleverly designed so that one stage prepares you for the next, and all stages require that you already spent a very long time to learn to remove the internal dialogue.\n\nInstead, people count any dream they can remember as a success, so they can tell their friends and suck up attention.\n\nThey do what people do in all the other magic subreddits.\n\nPretend.\n\nIt nearly destroyed everything we now work to restore.\n\nActual magic.\n\nWe've seen thousands pass through here in the last 5 years, and know very well what's going on with new people.\n\nSo please don't take this personally.\n\nYou need to be more serious.\n\nBut the good news is, you're aware you can only be silent for 2 seconds, and you didn't make up anything.\n\nSometimes we get people who make up several experiences they believe will impress people.\n\nIn their first post!\n\nWhen they're exposed they argue, fight, insist, try to bully, and then try to use self-pity to get us to back down.\n\nWhen we don't they pretend they're leaving, but often come back and try again.\n\nWith new stuff they made up to fool us.\n\nThose never learn and have to be tossed out.", "edited": 1695244839.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_k1h3w7y", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as you don&amp;#39;t tell us you can get silent for 10 minutes, everything is fine!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Searching for power spots implies you&amp;#39;re looking for pretend stuff to try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likely you have a romantic notion of the books, which doesn&amp;#39;t really even match what&amp;#39;s written there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d forget &amp;quot;power spots&amp;quot; for now.

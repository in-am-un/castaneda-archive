She's likely the one who helped me first \"stop the world\".\n\nThe power plants Carlos took merely helped move his assemblage point, so it could be more entertaining to play with little smoke.\n\nDon't forget that elsewhere he teaches him that a person who wants to be a sorcerer has to wander into the realm of the Brujo's to find a teacher, and that each time he must go deeper, until he never returns from that alternate world.\n\nBut later there's nothing of that.\n\nThere was a lot of that sort of thing, in the early books.

It's not something that should be inflated.  The concept of Man of Knowledge.\n\nIt's just a nerd. That's it.

They literally bump and move, just after a little puff of smoke flies under them.\n\nIn the past, beginning shortly after Carlos introduced us, she would appear in very fearsome forms.  I've even been chased by her and Devil's Weed ally, in a hotel in Asia.\n\nIt was during that trip that I fell into heightened awareness on my own for a couple of weeks, mostly by using stalking.\n\nAfter that I could see the puffs of color in the daytime, and even manipulate them with my hands.\n\nThat led me to try it in the dark, at which point I discovered what seemed to be a safe inorganic being.

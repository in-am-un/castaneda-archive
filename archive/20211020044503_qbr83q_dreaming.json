Don't move on, until you completed the previous gate.\n\nYou MUST visit the inorganic beings world.  That's especially important, or you won't have the dark energy needed.\n\nThe problem is, 4 gates dreamers are  huge liars on ego trips.\n\nThey have a bad dream, contort it in their mind to claim they were \"Lucid\", but in fact they never looked at their hands.\n\nAnd then they go to a discussion group, and bash their friends on the head with it, not explaining the truth.\n\nThey get 1 experience every 6 months, but pretend they have mastered the ability to do that daily.\n\nThey even go on Facebook and lie about a single experience, for a decade!\n\nThey aren't doing 4 gates. They're looking for things to lie about with their \"followers\".\n\nPlease don't misunderstand this. Sorcery has to be brutally honest at times.\n\nSo I'm not saying these people are murderers, or immoral, or blasphemed Jesus.\n\nOr ate the wrong foods.  Or were rude.\n\nNo insult is meant!\n\nI'm just pointing out, they are not doing 4 gates dreaming.\n\nYou are only doing 4 gates dreaming, if that's the only motivation you have for what you are doing.\n\nTHEN, and only then, *intent* helps you out.\n\nYou cannot wake up in the dream on your own!\n\nYou need to get \"tapped\" by *intent*.\n\nUnderstand this, above all else!\n\n**Intent** *made* the dream!\n\nIf you want to control it, you need it \"reskimmed\" to be a reality more like what you want.\n\nYou convince intent to reskim the emanations of your dream, and then it will \"activate\" you to explore it.\n\nThen, becoming lucid is your choice.  Intent only gives you the urge.\n\nOr makes you wonder.  Is this a dream?\n\nThat's from *intent*!\n\nYou might ignore the impetus and continue the dream, or you might stop and interrupt it.\n\nIf you get the impetus, take several steps away from whatever you were obsessed with, while brining your hands up to look at them.\n\nIt's the steps that's are important!  Those insure you won't fall back into the dream, but instead remain lucid.\n\nIf you **always** find your hands, **always** look from object to object, before continuing on the path of the four gates, you \"prove\" you aren't lying to yourself.\n\nThat's VERY important.  All darkroom really does, is PROVE you are learning to be silent.\n\nYou can't fool the puffs of brilliant purple. They know what you are thinking!\n\nLikewise, you NEED to look at your hands and at objects, before you proceed in lucid dreaming each time.\n\nThen learn as soon as possible, to \"zoom\" to distant objects. Like mountain tops, or sky scrapers.\n\nAfter you learn to hold on to the dream, when it begins to fade.\n\nIf you don't learn the zooming, the IOBs will trap you and suck your energy as often as they can.\n\nIf you do in fact learn that, you've \"wrestled\" them a bit.\n\nSo they start to help you out.  They tried trapping and sucking your energy but you don't allow it, so they move on to the next way to interact with you.\n\nYou have to \"wrestle\" them twice for any evil new trick they devise.\n\nFirst to reject their initial new idea.  Second, because they don't give up on an idea that quickly, and will modify it a tiny bit.\n\nIf you beat them twice, they give in to  you.\n\nAnd, this is mandatory. If you want to do real 4 gates dreaming, you need to find your hands more than 4 times each night, and learn to hold dreams for as long as 12 hours.\n\nAnyone really practicing it will not find that difficult to do. It just takes time.  A  year perhaps, to reach that level.\n\nAnd there's likely only one way to succeed at that.  You have to be WANTING it constantly, so that *intent* notices.\n\nInstead of \"flowing\" through our hellish life, believing something better is around the corner, you need to turn to face a new direction.\n\nInto dreaming!  Let your hopes be in there, instead of in your social routine.\n\nThe lucid dreaming folks remind themselves to become lucid all day.  With various methods, like testing if you are dreaming.  Multiple times a day.\n\nThey don't understand why that works, so they'll never get very far.\n\nBut we do.  You're summoning *intent*!\n\nBut a better way than :dream testing\" is to try to go directly into a dream while laying in bed waiting for sleep, using silence.\n\nYou can't get to the 3rd gate, with silence!  Carlos himself said so.\n\nAnd go to bed 4 hours early.  You'll need it!\n\nYou do that, and 4 gates dreaming absolutely will bring out the double, and teach you silence.\n\nAND get you an inorganic being.\n\nIt'll chase you right of a dream, scared to death of it, and then you'll find it's in the room, in the real world.\n\nJust don't be afraid.  Turn to face it, and make fun of it's clothes.\n\nOr appearance.\n\nThen suggest a better look for it.

Lucid dreaming  has never gotten anyone far enough to remove their doubts.  It&amp;#39;s never better than the best guy in the lucid dreaming forum, and they believe Carlos was a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With waking dreaming, you can do 100 times more per day than that, every single day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inorganic being visitors are continuous. They even take you to their world, and teach you magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that lucid dreaming isn&amp;#39;t really fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you get to the orange zone, you get that sort of dreaming automatically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After you lay down from practicing, you go right into lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an odd type though, in worlds that don Juan insists are &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typically worlds where other practitioners are waiting to interact with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taisha verified this happens.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By focusing all of your attention on sleeping dreaming, you avoid realizing you need to learn to get silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It killed the entire Castaneda community over the last 23 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not one single person learned any actual sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qbr83q/dreaming/hhd4663/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1634739454.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_qbr83q", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hhbyprj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "quotekingkiller", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1634710633.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hhbu060", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_9xmn52nq", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Not familiar with gazing, I just started to try and find my hands.

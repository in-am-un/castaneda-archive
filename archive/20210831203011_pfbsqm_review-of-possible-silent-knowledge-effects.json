I made it for Facebook, where they aren't yet out of the realm of pretending and bullying.  And I'm the \"bad guy\" spoiling the whole thing.\n\nHere's what Carlos wrote about this topic, in his \"Silent Knowledge\" publication.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSilent knowledge was an entire facet of the lives and activities of the shamans or sorcerers who lived in Mexico in ancient times. According to don Juan Matus, the sorcerer-teacher who introduced me in the cognitive world of those sorcerers, silent knowledge was the most coveted end result they sought through every one of their actions and thoughts. \n\nDon Juan defined silent knowledge as a state of human aware-ness in which everything pertinent to man is instantly revealed, not to the mind or the intellect, but to the entire being. He explained that there was a band of energy in the universe which sorcerers call the band of man, and that such a band was present in man. \n\nHe assured me that for sorcerer-seers, who see energy directly as it flows in the universe, and who can see a human being as a conglomerate of energy fields in the form of a luminous sphere, the band of man is a fringe of compact luminosity that cuts across the luminous sphere at an angle from its left side to its right. \n\nThe total luminous sphere is the width and the height of the extended arm, and in that luminous sphere, the band of man is perhaps around a foot wide. Silent knowledge, don Juan explained, is the interplay of energy within that band, an interplay which is instantly revealed to the shaman who has attained inner silence. \n\nDon Juan said that the average man had inklings of this energetic interplay. Man intuits it, and gets busy deducing its workings, figuring out its permutations. A sorcerer, on the other hand, gets a blast of the totality of this interplay at any time that the rendition of this interplay is solicit-ed.\n\nDon Juan assured me that the prelude to silent knowledge was a state of human perception which sorcerers called inner silence, a state void of the silent verbalizations that sorcerers call the internal dialogue, or even void of thoughts.\n\nNo matter how hard don Juan Matus tried to make his definitions and explanations of silent knowledge available to me, they remained obscure, mysterious, inscrutable. In his effort to clarify his point further, don Juan gave me a series of concrete examples of silent knowledge.\n\n\\*\\*\\* end inspirational quote \\*\\*\\*\n\nSo man's band is a foot wide?  I got the impression it was only 4 inches wide from the J curve demo Carlos gave.\n\nSo relax everyone. There's a whole foot of space in which to shift, to \"fine tune\" those possible 10,000 worlds you can get at a given level of the J curve.\n\nPlenty of space...\n\nSo, what's the goal of darkroom gazing?\n\nI'd say, to be able to perceive the abstract ALL THE TIME.\n\nThat means you moved your assemblage point all the way to the purple zone.  Not just the orange zone.\n\nIt's not the same as \"heightened awareness\".\n\nBut you can \"see it\" from heightened awareness.\n\nMostly, if you make it to heightened awareness and play around until you are in a phantom room, or can see whitish light everywhere, you can make it the rest of the way to Silent Knowledge simply by finding the last traces of your internal dialogue (now silenced), and getting rid of even those.\n\nWhat are they like?\n\nNot words!\n\nI suspect it's like the witches explanation of how we have a beam we focus between the toes, on the point of \"me, me, me\".\n\nShe's not talking about moving the assemblage point.\n\nShe's pointing out that we have some kind of \"navigator\" guy inside us, who decides where to focus our awareness.  And our awareness is like a \"beam\".\n\nIt happens if you are in the blue zone on the J curve, the green zone, the red zone, and even in the Orange zone.  The beam is always in use, until you stop wanting things.\n\nShades of Buddhism, isn't it?\n\nDoesn't happen in the purple zone (I suppose), because the abstract has little identifiable \"things\" to obsess over.\n\nThat \"beam focusing obsession\" is what you have to get rid of, to bring out Silent Knowledge.\n\nIn the darkroom it can become an \"abstract\" manifestation of your internal dialogue.\n\nSo you're \"perfectly\" silent.  From forcing off the internal dialogue.\n\nYour assemblage point moves to the orange, and the whitish light is on everything.\n\nThat means, you can gaze at the whitish light and let it \"translate\" things for you. Or \"find\" things.\n\nIf you gaze at it, like it was a flat surface, then whatever you want to know stirs the emanations.\n\nAnd they can form an answer for you.\n\nIf what you want to know is, \"Why the hell am I still not in 'Silent Knowledge'?\", it's ok with that.\n\nIt'll help.\n\nSo the \"leftovers\" of your internal dialogue become \"visible\".\n\nThat can be literal.\n\nOr it can be a \"pressure\".  Like a feverish obsession that's not quite easy to see or describe.\n\nBut you'll know that's the left over internal dialogue, because as you \"stir\" it by paying attention, reality starts to break into pieces.\n\nExample.  In silence you gaze at the whitish light, and there's a little dream scene.  Not very clear, but it's definitely \"something\" floating in the air, on the whitish light.\n\nYou try to make it more realistic looking.  Your motivation is pure greed!  You want that faint magic to be even cooler.\n\nYou realize, \"Hey, I'm silent!  How come that's not enough???\"\n\nAnd then you notice, \"Oh. It's the can of tomato soup, with the rock on top of it.\"\n\nDid I mention, silent knowledge often makes no sense, and you don't care at the time?\n\nYou start to wiggle the can of soup with your fingers, like it was a loose tooth, and you were trying to get it to break off.  So you can be even more silent.\n\nBut the instant you \"touch\" the can, the little scene you are trying to stabilize lights up, and each element turns into a bump or a bubble. It's completely obvious that if you can just remove that soup can, something even more magical is going to happen.\n\nExcept, not only does your little dreaming scene react, but you yourself react.\n\nParts of yourself that can only be described as \"obsessive feelings about the world\", fall away and you become \"empty\".\n\nThat's the playground you want to find, for now.\n\nHeightened awareness is not a goal.\n\nIt's just a starting point.  Like climbing to the top of a low hill, so you can get a better look of where you live.\n\nBut it's lonely on that hill?\n\nNope.  You'll find your double, if you keep looking around.\n\nHe never gets lonely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Review of Possible Silent Knowledge Effects", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"0jxhumj1jqk71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0jxhumj1jqk71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7d3de606affd7e3329ed501e53566643292e165"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0jxhumj1jqk71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e0fe889d02f65a167e625be5e890b44a1e71c0a"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0jxhumj1jqk71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38f39b7924d17beffa95ddecb140aa83d7057625"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0jxhumj1jqk71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6f1407e664bb4876f6190cdd2730272364422d4"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0jxhumj1jqk71.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b99b49d1c147f740c92aa251c9f469b4be589d0"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0jxhumj1jqk71.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe84c1e38df89f056c68c4136d387cff75716e0d"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0jxhumj1jqk71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e23c357bc65bed1696836018292f0f840e7be53c"}, "id": "0jxhumj1jqk71"}}, "name": "t3_pfbsqm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/LJXJXAlqRNWTJpONKjeW5WLxU1i1fAPTSdXdyAsQya8.jpg", "edited": 1630436761.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1630434611.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0jxhumj1jqk71.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e23c357bc65bed1696836018292f0f840e7be53c\"&gt;Some examples of Silent Knowledge, and NOT Silent Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You guys already know this stuff.

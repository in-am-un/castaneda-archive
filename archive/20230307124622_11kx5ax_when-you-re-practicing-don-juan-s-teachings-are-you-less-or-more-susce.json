Shadows. The fog and wind.\n\nIn fact, that's one of the things Tensegrity does which I can't possibly put into a picture.  Maybe into a cartoon, but not a still.\n\nIt \"retrains\" how you feel about reality and solidity. Until you can literally move your assemblage point, just by walking around.\n\nBut for what you meant, the answer is No. \n\nReligions are all con games made up after money was invented.\n\nStudy them if you get a chance!  Carlos gave me the task to study the bible, but if you study that you end up studying all Asian systems, since  they originate from the same place as Judaism.\n\nAnything newer than money is crapola.\n\nNothing to worry about from that nonsense, unless they secretly poison you the way some magical cults are rumored to do, to give the illusion of magic.\n\nNow, if you want exceptions...\n\nOur magic is ice age magic, from proto-siberia.  It thrived when they migrated to south america when the last ice age ended.\n\nMost world religions obviously come from a north african strain of ancient shamanism.  Pre-money.  Just look at the migrations of the peoples, and what their oldest writings say about \"the renowned men of old\".\n\nHinduism, Daoism, and thus Buddhism, also come from that middle eastern region where Judaism comes from, which was fed from that north african population migration.\n\nIt just spread north through the landmasses connected to africa.\n\nYou can follow it historically, but be careful because some crappy hinduism peddlers have made up a new narrative with absolutely nothing to back it up.\n\nSo if someone claims Hinduism does NOT come from Iran,  and thus from Ishtar based religions, ask them for why they believe that.\n\nThey can't point to anything at all. They always run away if you insist on see their source.\n\nSome make the argument about that 10,000 year old population already in India.  But there's no good evidence for what that might have been.\n\nAnd there's plenty for pre-Hinduism in Iran. In fact, the bible itself complains about the origins of Hinduism in Iran and that area.  Calls them out on how they worship, and it matches what goes on in India now.\n\nWhat's more interesting however, is that my Ally \"Mystery\" claimed there were 8 \"strains\" of shamanism very long ago.\n\nLike maybe 100,000 years ago. Pre-language.\n\nAnd remember, we're talking pre money.  Pre writing systems.  Pre books.  Pre cities.\n\nSo there was absolutely no benefit to making up magic back then.\n\nNo one would do it!\n\nSo anything  you can find that truly comes from those original strains, will contain REAL magic created over thousands of years, by people who didn't make up stuff.  They only had magic, because it helped them survive better.\n\nI can't emphasize enough, anything created after money is make believe.\n\nJust watch this subreddit to see how impossible it is, to fight off the make believe stuff.\n\nEven our own Miles is possibly now absorbed by make believe.\n\nLost his mommy Cholita would claim, so he got another one.\n\nPatricia?\n\nAnd then to the fun part.\n\nWe DO know of 2 more strains of ancient shamanism.\n\nThe one still present in Australia.\n\nAnd the ones sprinkled on the Islands of southeast Asia.\n\nLike Taiwan. But Japan too!\n\nThose have witches.  And it seems to be left over magic from very long ago.  Pre-money even.\n\n\"Islander Shamanism\".\n\nI haven't studied Australian Aboriginal magic, but I'm assuming it's a slightly different variety than they have for example, among the \"native indian\" population of Taiwan.\n\nWho are indistinguishable from the chinese, unless you start measuring foot and breast size.\n\nI need to make a cartoon about this, featuring my entity \"Mystery\".\n\nBut still, that's only 4 strains of ancient magic.\n\nAnd Mystery said 8.\n\nSo what else is out there?\n\nCould the Celts have had some ancient shamanism?   A pre-jewish migrations \"euro-strain\"?\n\nUnfortunately, whatever you hear about Celtic magic is made up.\n\nThere's just a few lines of text anywhere, discussing their magic.  And it's nothing to write home about.  The rest you find is just bad players making up stuff to sell.\n\nMaybe there's other ancient strains which are just not visible to us, because they're like the new seers who hide their lineages?\n\nPeople who have real magic don't need to promote it.  Because they aren't going to be willing to earn a living with it.\n\nDon't need to!\n\nAnd we certainly can't say it's impossible to have magic that's different from ours.\n\nThere's those \"dangerous\" types of inorganic beings.\n\nThere's my \"Stella\", who seems to be an inorganic being that's a tiny part of a sun.\n\nThere's \"The Abstract\", which is completely impossible to even think clearly about.\n\nAnd which might in fact be the \"glue\" between worlds.\n\nSo different forms of magic might actually be possible.\n\nBut those would be REAL magic.\n\nNot church propaganda.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jbbn8a6", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well... the way you put that last part is like a wild card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can those move your ap?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course!!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita uses Bagua mirrors to &amp;quot;trap&amp;quot; me.

Shadows. The fog and wind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, that&amp;#39;s one of the things Tensegrity does which I can&amp;#39;t possibly put into a picture.  Maybe into a cartoon, but not a still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It &amp;quot;retrains&amp;quot; how you feel about reality and solidity. Until you can literally move your assemblage point, just by walking around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for what you meant, the answer is No. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Religions are all con games made up after money was invented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Study them if you get a chance!  Carlos gave me the task to study the bible, but if you study that you end up studying all Asian systems, since  they originate from the same place as Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything newer than money is crapola.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing to worry about from that nonsense, unless they secretly poison you the way some magical cults are rumored to do, to give the illusion of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if you want exceptions...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our magic is ice age magic, from proto-siberia.  It thrived when they migrated to south america when the last ice age ended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most world religions obviously come from a north african strain of ancient shamanism.  Pre-money.  Just look at the migrations of the peoples, and what their oldest writings say about &amp;quot;the renowned men of old&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hinduism, Daoism, and thus Buddhism, also come from that middle eastern region where Judaism comes from, which was fed from that north african population migration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just spread north through the landmasses connected to africa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can follow it historically, but be careful because some crappy hinduism peddlers have made up a new narrative with absolutely nothing to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if someone claims Hinduism does NOT come from Iran,  and thus from Ishtar based religions, ask them for why they believe that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can&amp;#39;t point to anything at all. They always run away if you insist on see their source.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some make the argument about that 10,000 year old population already in India.  But there&amp;#39;s no good evidence for what that might have been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s plenty for pre-Hinduism in Iran. In fact, the bible itself complains about the origins of Hinduism in Iran and that area.  Calls them out on how they worship, and it matches what goes on in India now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s more interesting however, is that my Ally &amp;quot;Mystery&amp;quot; claimed there were 8 &amp;quot;strains&amp;quot; of shamanism very long ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like maybe 100,000 years ago. Pre-language.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And remember, we&amp;#39;re talking pre money.  Pre writing systems.  Pre books.  Pre cities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there was absolutely no benefit to making up magic back then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one would do it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So anything  you can find that truly comes from those original strains, will contain REAL magic created over thousands of years, by people who didn&amp;#39;t make up stuff.  They only had magic, because it helped them survive better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t emphasize enough, anything created after money is make believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just watch this subreddit to see how impossible it is, to fight off the make believe stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even our own Miles is possibly now absorbed by make believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lost his mommy Cholita would claim, so he got another one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Patricia?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then to the fun part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We DO know of 2 more strains of ancient shamanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one still present in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the ones sprinkled on the Islands of southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Taiwan. But Japan too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those have witches.  And it seems to be left over magic from very long ago.  Pre-money even.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Islander Shamanism&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t studied Australian Aboriginal magic, but I&amp;#39;m assuming it&amp;#39;s a slightly different variety than they have for example, among the &amp;quot;native indian&amp;quot; population of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who are indistinguishable from the chinese, unless you start measuring foot and breast size.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need to make a cartoon about this, featuring my entity &amp;quot;Mystery&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still, that&amp;#39;s only 4 strains of ancient magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Mystery said 8.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what else is out there?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could the Celts have had some ancient shamanism?   A pre-jewish migrations &amp;quot;euro-strain&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, whatever you hear about Celtic magic is made up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s just a few lines of text anywhere, discussing their magic.  And it&amp;#39;s nothing to write home about.  The rest you find is just bad players making up stuff to sell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe there&amp;#39;s other ancient strains which are just not visible to us, because they&amp;#39;re like the new seers who hide their lineages?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who have real magic don&amp;#39;t need to promote it.  Because they aren&amp;#39;t going to be willing to earn a living with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t need to!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we certainly can&amp;#39;t say it&amp;#39;s impossible to have magic that&amp;#39;s different from ours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s those &amp;quot;dangerous&amp;quot; types of inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s my &amp;quot;Stella&amp;quot;, who seems to be an inorganic being that&amp;#39;s a tiny part of a sun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;The Abstract&amp;quot;, which is completely impossible to even think clearly about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And which might in fact be the &amp;quot;glue&amp;quot; between worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So different forms of magic might actually be possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But those would be REAL magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not church propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_11kx5ax", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11kx5ax/when_youre_practicing_don_juans_teachings_are_you/jbbn8a6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1678225539.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1678225539.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbba8kw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Ok-Assistance175", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbb9mpw", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_9qdplfxw", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "The official religions keep us as food stuff for something\u2026", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jbba8kw", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official religions keep us as food stuff for something\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_11kx5ax", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11kx5ax/when_youre_practicing_don_juans_teachings_are_you/jbba8kw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1678220685.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1678220685.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbb9mpw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "CiChocolate", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbb7ofb", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_nlmc8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Hm, so other magic can affect us, but not the official religions though, right?

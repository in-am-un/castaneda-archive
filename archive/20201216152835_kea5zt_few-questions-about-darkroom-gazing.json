You have proof of life after death!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re beyond the pope at that point!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it haunts you, you&amp;#39;ve just picked up a new magical friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some magical friends are not &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot;.  Like Cholita.  You just go with what they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How can you lose, when something non-corporeal frightens you in a dark room?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just forget about fear.  You&amp;#39;ll soon realize, it&amp;#39;s your best friend.  When you feel it, look around carefully because your assemblage point just moved, and more magic will be visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you shake your head, rub your eyes, and force the tingle to go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, if you feel the tingle of fear relish it!  You need to learn to summon that feeling at just the right moment, if you want to make it easier to &amp;quot;stop the world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, one way to stop the world is by &amp;quot;tingle surfing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you can fight back against fear. Get a copy of the first Hellraiser, and watch it until you think pinhead is kind of cute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lidotska shrunk him down to 4 inches tall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe go on roller coasters to get familiar with the tingle down the spine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy tried a scare on me last night, but I was so far into my dreaming double it was mostly pointless.  Wish I could remember what she did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My reaction was, &amp;quot;Yes Fancy!  You haven&amp;#39;t tried to scare me in a while. Do your worst!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stretched out my arms so she could turn into a giant monster with sharp teeth, but she was just a little pink head a few inches in diameter.  With a disappointed look I might add.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped doing more than 1 of her combination tensegrity pass, to keep her from gaining too much control.  It&amp;#39;s made her appear more, on her own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, to your question. What you are doing already is in fact disorganized dark room gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Children often learn to do it, but because no one talks to them about it, they decide it&amp;#39;s imaginary and they don&amp;#39;t pursue it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the key point: You tapped into a &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; humans can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not the same as the &amp;quot;Intent of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s more like dusty old railroad tracks leading off into a jungle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your ability is like the &amp;quot;hand car&amp;quot; to put on the tracks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you put it on the wrong tracks, you won&amp;#39;t learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially shiny new tracks.  Yes, they&amp;#39;re prettier to look at, but they lead to the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially those Chinese railroad tracks. Stay off those!   I get worried when I hear &amp;quot;Dantian&amp;quot;.    = potential angry male looking for attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shun outside stuff you learned.

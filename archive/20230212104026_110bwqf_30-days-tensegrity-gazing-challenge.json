I\u2019ll use Zuleica\u2019s fingers wiggling technique instead of stones, as it really helps me to not to succumb to sleep. And running man for that lazy days\n\n**12/04/23**\n\n3 hours DRG. Did running man sitting. There was vague fog following legs movement. Have been noticing such things before, but never with legs, only with hands.\n\nPractice seemed terrible without silence stones, I couldn\u2019t make myself do that wiggling and eventually fell asleep\n\n**13/04/23**\n\nSkipped practice\n\n**14/04/23**\n\nSkipped practice\n\n**15/04/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours.

Running man, a series for intent. Started to use silence stones again. Without them I find it hard to silence thoughts. They kinda give a \u201cleverage\u201d\n\n**17/04/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Did a bit of sunlight glitter gathering. Also, finally setup my bedroom to be fully dark, so no need to spend hours in bathroom from now on.\n\n**18/04/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Did set of different passes. Unbending intent is way more interesting in full darkness, jumping even a little bit is quite scary.\n\n**19/04/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Gathered some sunlight glitter. Again did different passes (first bits of series for decision making, Zuleica, lifesaver) once in a while during darkroom and walked around to stay awake. Had a few images pop up for an instant in front of my open eyes\n\n**20/04/23**\n\nSkipped practice\n\n**21/04/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Started from recapping the day. Gathered sunlight glitter, did running man, Zuleica\u2019s pass and wiggling, decision making passes and lifesaver. Dosed off\n\n**22/04/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Started from recapping the day. Did same set of passes and dosed of in the end\n\n**23/04/23**\n\nSkipped practice\n\n**24/04/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Recapped two days. Did same set if passes. I go to sleep right after the DRG, and I can swear that I saw a face formed from purple fog when I closed my eyes. With a creepy smile on it\n\n**25/04/23**\n\nSpent 1 hour recapping the day\n\n**26/04/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Recapped the day. Did almost no tensegrity. It felt like I fell unconscious for the whole practice\n\n**27/04/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Quickly recapped the day. Did same set of tensegrity passes\n\n**28/04/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Recapped the day quickly. No tensegrity, just laid unconscious for 3 hours with opened eyes\n\n**29/04/23**\n\nSkipped practice\n\n**30/04/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Racapped two days. Did running man. Saw quite a lot hypnogogic images in purple fog when forcing silence. Dozed of for around an hour after\n\n**01/05/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Recapped the day. Did series for decision making, lifesaver, Zuleica\u2019s techniques and some individual passes from unbending intent.    At some point, vague purple fog changed to very dim yellowish. During last hours eyes were closing involuntarily\n\n**02/05/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Gathered sunlight glitter in the morning. Used reflection from phone instead of staring directly. Recapped the day. Did all the same passes plus affection for energy body\n\n**03/05/23**\n\nSkipped the practice\n\n**04/05/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Recapped two days. Did same passes as previously. Sat whole 3 hours in the room maybe for the first time (usually went to toilet or checked time on phone). Didn\u2019t fell asleep because never laid down, it\u2019s crucial.\n\n**05/05/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Recapped the day very quick. Did the same passes\n\n**06/05/23**\n\nSkipped practice\n\n**07/05/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours. Finally learnt full series for decision making point. Recapped two days quickly. When doing affection for the energy body, I see a purple swirl starting to pulsate. Fell asleep eventually because was very tired\n\n**08/05/23**\n\nCandle gazing 3 hours, followed by 30 mins darkroom. Noticed that eyes \u201cshake\u201d when focusing for too long on fire, bringing perception back to normal. This shake constitutes of quick changes of perceived image, between the ones that left and right eye see. Consciously switching dominant eye (when both are open) seems to prolong ability to focus\n\n**09/05/23**\n\nSkipped practice\n\n**10/05/23**\n\nSkipped practice\n\n**11/05/23**\n\nDRG 3 hours, kinda.

This  time I\u2019d like to learn new long form (probably westwood series, need to look for a description here). I\u2019ll use Zuleica\u2019s fingers wiggling technique instead of stones, as it really helps me to not to succumb to sleep. And running man for that lazy days&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 hours DRG. Did running man sitting. There was vague fog following legs movement. Have been noticing such things before, but never with legs, only with hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Practice seemed terrible without silence stones, I couldn\u2019t make myself do that wiggling and eventually fell asleep&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skipped practice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skipped practice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Did a small set of different passes - running man, lifesaver, Zuleica\u2019s, and beginning of a series for decision making (still learning the moves)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Running man, a series for intent. Started to use silence stones again. Without them I find it hard to silence thoughts. They kinda give a \u201cleverage\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Did a bit of sunlight glitter gathering. Also, finally setup my bedroom to be fully dark, so no need to spend hours in bathroom from now on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Did set of different passes. Unbending intent is way more interesting in full darkness, jumping even a little bit is quite scary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Gathered some sunlight glitter. Again did different passes (first bits of series for decision making, Zuleica, lifesaver) once in a while during darkroom and walked around to stay awake. Had a few images pop up for an instant in front of my open eyes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skipped practice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Started from recapping the day. Gathered sunlight glitter, did running man, Zuleica\u2019s pass and wiggling, decision making passes and lifesaver. Dosed off&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Started from recapping the day. Did same set of passes and dosed of in the end&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skipped practice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Recapped two days. Did same set if passes. I go to sleep right after the DRG, and I can swear that I saw a face formed from purple fog when I closed my eyes. With a creepy smile on it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spent 1 hour recapping the day&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Recapped the day. Did almost no tensegrity. It felt like I fell unconscious for the whole practice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Quickly recapped the day. Did same set of tensegrity passes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Recapped the day quickly. No tensegrity, just laid unconscious for 3 hours with opened eyes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skipped practice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30/04/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Racapped two days. Did running man. Saw quite a lot hypnogogic images in purple fog when forcing silence. Dozed of for around an hour after&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;01/05/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Recapped the day. Did series for decision making, lifesaver, Zuleica\u2019s techniques and some individual passes from unbending intent.    At some point, vague purple fog changed to very dim yellowish. During last hours eyes were closing involuntarily&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;02/05/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Gathered sunlight glitter in the morning. Used reflection from phone instead of staring directly. Recapped the day. Did all the same passes plus affection for energy body&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;03/05/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skipped the practice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;04/05/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Recapped two days. Did same passes as previously. Sat whole 3 hours in the room maybe for the first time (usually went to toilet or checked time on phone). Didn\u2019t fell asleep because never laid down, it\u2019s crucial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;05/05/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Recapped the day very quick. Did the same passes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;06/05/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skipped practice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;07/05/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours. Finally learnt full series for decision making point. Recapped two days quickly. When doing affection for the energy body, I see a purple swirl starting to pulsate. Fell asleep eventually because was very tired&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;08/05/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Candle gazing 3 hours, followed by 30 mins darkroom. Noticed that eyes \u201cshake\u201d when focusing for too long on fire, bringing perception back to normal. This shake constitutes of quick changes of perceived image, between the ones that left and right eye see. Consciously switching dominant eye (when both are open) seems to prolong ability to focus&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;09/05/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skipped practice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10/05/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skipped practice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11/05/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours, kinda. Was very tired and fell asleep right away&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12/05/23&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DRG 3 hours.

My eyes were covered with a blackout mask as i don't have a dark room.  It was very difficult for me to stop the inner dialogue. He kept showing up. But i will try to remain without expectations and see what happens. I will also keep reminding myself (all day long) to observe the inner dialogue and to calm it down.\n\nNevertheless, I could perceive purple puffs. I don't know if it's the same puffs you're talking about, cause these seemed to be very vague.\n\nI also looked at the sun with my cell phone for 20 minutes (sunlight glitter). It is as if i can perceive countless circles, which remain in their position with complete peace. It's like looking into another world. There's even something calming about it. In any case, I will try to do this exercise every day cause i am loving it.\n\nI feel like my attitude towards all of this is changing. It's like it's going to be natural. I'm curious how it looks in 30 days.\n\n\\--- Maybe more this evening.\n\nA little update. I have done another 30 minutes of tensegrety in the afternoon. The same series as this mornung. And another 15 minutes of sun glitter. I really like it.\n\nFurthermore i practised the first 5 movements of the third group (dreaming) i think tomorrow i will do the rest. And now to have some fun i will go for DRG and try to get some purple puffs and play with them. More tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 2:**\n\n* Completed the third group (dreaming).\n* 2 x 30 min of tensegrety with DRG\n* 20 min of sunlight glitter\n* What i find out is that the inner voice is really annoying. When i try to cut of the inner voice it comes back twice as strong. But i won't give up yet.\n* More tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 3:**\n\nToday was the first time i was doing darkroom for 60 min straight. I have done tensegrety the groups mentioned above each 3 times and after that i was walking around. Before i started tensegrety i have done 5 min of sunlight glitter.\n\nAt the beginning of darkroom and tensegrety my inner voice was calm. During tensegrety the inner voice started a few times but each time i tried to put my attention back to the moves. I think i haven't seen any purple puffs at all.\n\nDuring the day i tried to keep up the inner silence. But like the days before it is still like pain in the ass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 4:**\n\n* 1x 10 min tensegrety and 1x 20 min tensegrety in darkroom. The tensegrety movements happen by themselves without thinking.\n* gazing a stone 10 min and drg 40 min (during drg i dozed few times off)\n* tried again and again to stop my inner voice, but this still seems impossible\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 5:**\n\n* 25 min tensegrety in darkroom, today i conecentrated more on the moves instead of seeing anything. The moves were more fluent and my inner voice were quiter, but still a long way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 6:**\n\n* Learned the 4th series (inner silence)\n* 30 min tensegrety in darkroom\n* 20 min drg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 7:**\n\n* Have done nothing. Too tired from work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 8:**\n\n* I have done 40 min of tensegrety in darkroom. I had a feeling of seeing my hands through my mask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 9:**\n\n* The same like on Day 8. I have done 40 min of tensegrety in darkroom. I had a feeling of seeing my hands through my mask. I feel like I've calmed down since i started. The inner voice is still there but quiter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 10:**\n\n* I have done 40 min of tensegrety in darkroom. I had the same feeling like on day 9. But the feeling wasn't stronger and i haven't seen more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 11:**\n\n* I have done 5 min of sunlight glitter.\n* Today was the first time i have done the westwood series 3 times in a row. My inner voice wasn't strong. I had a good concentration on the movements. It was like my body has done the movements all by his own. I did not have to think much about the sequences of the movements.\n* I haven't really noticed the purple puffs yet. Maybe i am not in my second attention yet?\n* I'm excited to see what the next days will bring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 12:**\n\n* 30 min of drg\n* 30 min tensegrety in darkroom. It felt awesome. I had the feeling that i was surrounded by many purple puffs. I was really quiet. It felt awesome. But after 30 min my inner voice started again and i gave it up for this evening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 13:**\n\n* After 12 days of only practising the westwood serie i started to reactivate the first series. The series of preparing intent. I have learned this 1 year ago when i have done a lot of tensegrety but without darkroom. The exercises quickly came back to my mind. Now I will try these step by step in the darkroom.\n* 30 min tensegrety and 10 min of drg\n* It is very hard to keep up the focus on inner silence during drg. While doing tensegrety i am very quiet. But after tensegrety during drg the inner voice is starting again. :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 14:**\n\n* 40 min tensegrety in darkroom\n* 30 min drg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 15:**\n\n* 15 min tensegrety in darkroom\n* 15 min drg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 16:**\n\n* During the day I focus my awareness on my body and try to achieve inner silence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 17:**\n\n* During the day I focus my awareness on my body and try to achieve inner silence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 18:**\n\n* During the day I focus my awareness on my body and try to achieve inner silence.\n* 40 min of tensegrety in darkroom", "edited": 1678609415.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j9f6eds", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the idea of \u200b\u200bdocumenting the progress is great.

I had a feeling of seeing my hands through my mask.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The same like on Day 8. I have done 40 min of tensegrety in darkroom. I had a feeling of seeing my hands through my mask. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve calmed down since i started. The inner voice is still there but quiter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 10:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have done 40 min of tensegrety in darkroom. I had the same feeling like on day 9. But the feeling wasn&amp;#39;t stronger and i haven&amp;#39;t seen more.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 11:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have done 5 min of sunlight glitter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Today was the first time i have done the westwood series 3 times in a row. My inner voice wasn&amp;#39;t strong. I had a good concentration on the movements. It was like my body has done the movements all by his own. I did not have to think much about the sequences of the movements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t really noticed the purple puffs yet. Maybe i am not in my second attention yet?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m excited to see what the next days will bring.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 12:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;30 min of drg&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;30 min tensegrety in darkroom. It felt awesome. I had the feeling that i was surrounded by many purple puffs. I was really quiet. It felt awesome. But after 30 min my inner voice started again and i gave it up for this evening.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 13:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;After 12 days of only practising the westwood serie i started to reactivate the first series. The series of preparing intent. I have learned this 1 year ago when i have done a lot of tensegrety but without darkroom. The exercises quickly came back to my mind. Now I will try these step by step in the darkroom.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;30 min tensegrety and 10 min of drg&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It is very hard to keep up the focus on inner silence during drg. While doing tensegrety i am very quiet. But after tensegrety during drg the inner voice is starting again. :(&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 14:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;40 min tensegrety in darkroom&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;30 min drg&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 15:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;15 min tensegrety in darkroom&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;15 min drg&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 16:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;During the day I focus my awareness on my body and try to achieve inner silence.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 17:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;During the day I focus my awareness on my body and try to achieve inner silence.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 18:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;During the day I focus my awareness on my body and try to achieve inner silence.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;40 min of tensegrety in darkroom&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/110bwqf/30_days_tensegrity_gazing_challenge/j9f6eds/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1676988544.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_110bwqf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j89msfg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j89lxle", "score": 10, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Actually we could modify that to be a sorcery technique!\n\nI do DRG using my cellphone from time to time.\n\nI combine it with sunlight glitter.

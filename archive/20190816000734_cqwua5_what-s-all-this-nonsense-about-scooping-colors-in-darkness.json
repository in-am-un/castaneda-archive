And from what I can tell, even many Asians feel that way.\n\nLet me tell a Japan story.\n\nA 4 day weekend came around, and somehow I knew Carlos wouldn\u2019t have Sunday classes that weekend.\n\nSo without anyone knowing, I took a plane to Tokyo.\n\nI didn't bring anything, there wasn't time.\n\nI was wandering around near the college, where the most famous red light district in Japan is also located. Perhaps for the convenience of male college students.  Or maybe, it's staffed by college girls who want to earn a little money on the side.\n\nWho knows? It's Asia.\n\nI stopped at a McDonald's, because I saw a little boy licking an ice-cream cone. He was looking up at a big poster, advertising a bondage dungeon, right next to the McDonalds.\n\nThere was a picture of a women tied up, with a red ball gag in her mouth. You could hire such services.\n\nHis mom didn't even blink. As they say in Japan, \"It can't be helped.\"\n\nI was curious about what else was going on, but I hadn\u2019t brought a watch, and wanted to know how late it was. Arriving in Japan is a little disorienting, due to the time change.\n\nThere were no smart phones back then so I had nothing with which to know the time.\n\nI saw a crew of vicious looking motorcycle gang members, posing with their legs resting on their Harley Davidson bikes. They looked really tough, decked out in shiny black leather with chains.\n\nThat area is known for yakuza standing on corners, in case you want something \"special\". By special I mean, something you can\u2019t advertise openly.\n\nThe Yakuza are the descendants of men who handle dead things. Leather makers, undertakers, and the like.  As a result, they are \"unclean\", meaning, they have evil spirits following them.  Being such, they have no choice but to become criminals.\n\nAs long as the \"public\" isn't hurt, the police are ok with it.  If a yakuza crosses the line, they're banished to Bangkok for 6 months, where the Yakuza owns all the prettiest girls in the bars.   \n\nI was a little worried, because it looked like the high fashion motorcycle gang was out for a fight.  The men seemed to be chewing on something, grinding their teeth with an angry look. \n\nHowever, they had 2 extremely hot looking female gang members, also decked out in leather and chains, but wearing the shortest mini-skirts I\u2019d ever seen.\n\nSo I walked up to the tough looking gang, and asked what time it was.\n\nThe leader rushed up to me, stood the proper distance, and bowed deeply. As I recall, he actually bowed 3 times.\n\nHe lifted his watch up to show me the time, and all the rest of the \u201cgang\u201d bowed too.  The women covered their mouths and giggled for me.\n\nLater a Japanese man explained it to me. They are rebelling against the oppressive Japanese social order. And they like the freedom that the image of \u201cHell\u2019s Angels\u201d represents.\n\nBut in order to remain Japanese, they have to rebel in some established social offshoot. Wear the same clothes, and do the same things.\n\nSo by trying to escape to freedom, they merely ended up switching which chicken coop they were trapped in.\n\nI hope that isn't what happened to all of Carlos' former students.", "edited": 1565994391.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ex33ed7", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I both dearly love Asia, and also despise it.

He was looking up at a big poster, advertising a bondage dungeon, right next to the McDonalds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a picture of a women tied up, with a red ball gag in her mouth. You could hire such services.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His mom didn&amp;#39;t even blink. As they say in Japan, &amp;quot;It can&amp;#39;t be helped.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was curious about what else was going on, but I hadn\u2019t brought a watch, and wanted to know how late it was. Arriving in Japan is a little disorienting, due to the time change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were no smart phones back then so I had nothing with which to know the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a crew of vicious looking motorcycle gang members, posing with their legs resting on their Harley Davidson bikes. They looked really tough, decked out in shiny black leather with chains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That area is known for yakuza standing on corners, in case you want something &amp;quot;special&amp;quot;. By special I mean, something you can\u2019t advertise openly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Yakuza are the descendants of men who handle dead things. Leather makers, undertakers, and the like.  As a result, they are &amp;quot;unclean&amp;quot;, meaning, they have evil spirits following them.  Being such, they have no choice but to become criminals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as the &amp;quot;public&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t hurt, the police are ok with it.  If a yakuza crosses the line, they&amp;#39;re banished to Bangkok for 6 months, where the Yakuza owns all the prettiest girls in the bars.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a little worried, because it looked like the high fashion motorcycle gang was out for a fight.  The men seemed to be chewing on something, grinding their teeth with an angry look. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, they had 2 extremely hot looking female gang members, also decked out in leather and chains, but wearing the shortest mini-skirts I\u2019d ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I walked up to the tough looking gang, and asked what time it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The leader rushed up to me, stood the proper distance, and bowed deeply. As I recall, he actually bowed 3 times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He lifted his watch up to show me the time, and all the rest of the \u201cgang\u201d bowed too.  The women covered their mouths and giggled for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later a Japanese man explained it to me. They are rebelling against the oppressive Japanese social order. And they like the freedom that the image of \u201cHell\u2019s Angels\u201d represents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in order to remain Japanese, they have to rebel in some established social offshoot. Wear the same clothes, and do the same things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So by trying to escape to freedom, they merely ended up switching which chicken coop they were trapped in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope that isn&amp;#39;t what happened to all of Carlos&amp;#39; former students.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_cqwua5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/cqwua5/whats_all_this_nonsense_about_scooping_colors_in/ex33ed7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1565979544.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1565979544.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ex1110h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "takestheraftwithhim", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1565927439.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ex0bjjn", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_h16ufz", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Thank you.

This is starting to freak me out. I knew sorcery was somewhat deterministic but this is crazy. Like I had literally seen that after I saw like whitish/yellowish stuff in the air. ??\n\nIs sorcery really that similar for everyone?\n\n**OP (Me):**  No it's not. Anything I make \"contaminates\" everyone with those images.\n\nBut it's either that, or let it all die.\n\nAs a result of my posts, we're a LOT more visual than Carlos and his group was. We're kind of \"super visual\".\n\nBut how cool is that????\n\nAs for the sun thing, it's a poor portrayal. But it's \"silent knowledge\" manifesting in a very simple form.\n\nAs a visible concrete thing.\n\nI see those constantly during the night these days.\n\nCould be it's \"broken off shiny outer coating\" moving around directed by your gaze. At any rate, if you see those and they are INTENSE at times, and stable, you've reached Silent Knowledge.\n\nBut a beginning phase of it. Whether others all will see those sparkle patches, we don't yet know.\n\nKeep in mind, Carlos taught us to search for things like that. In his case, \"the whorl\". It's that blobby yin/yang thing which develops the pomegranate dot, and then text spits off of it.\n\nSo I guess you could say, the sparkly sun thing is an \"offer\". From Silent Knowledge. It's a very basic \"presentation method\".\n\nBut if your link to intent isn't super clean, no topic will be selected. So it'll only be promising to \"present\", but nothing more will come.\n\nTwo easy things to do with that sparkle patch (this one):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/815onze2cvcc1.jpeg?width=2160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7bd4bc81080d4706ee95d0f1a178764eb329f3b\n\nAre to inhale mildly deep while gazing at it, and stretch the chest forward with the back slightly curved, so that you are \"leaning into it\" slightly with your chest.\n\nIf you do it right the sparkles will intensify until you nearly pass out. So sit down! Stay near some thing you can quickly sit on if you do that.\n\nBUT, once you can get to the \"edge\" of passing out while gazing into the sparkles, back off the projecting your chest into it, let the air out so there's no pressure, and let the \"pass out\" experience fade away.\n\nThen there in front of you will be a very stable phantom view of some alien world. Mostly too abstract to recognize anything.\n\nBut it'll be clear, and have good details.\n\nWhat you did there, was \"project\" the presentation method out into the room, and it became a \"topic\".  A random alien phantom wall in front of you.\n\nNext thing to do is reach up with your hands on both sides of it, and toss it down to the floor. Not so fast you disturb yourself. You're sleep walking at this point.\n\nSo gently \"cast\" it down to the ground. Don't take no for an answer. Of course, you might have to turn your head to make sure it goes down.\n\nNow on the floor, make it brighter with Zuleica's pass, or with some of the foot movement passes. It'll get brighter if you do it right. If not, forget it. Never practice failure!\n\nBut if it gets brighter stick your hand in it, and then turn way back, arm carrying it along, and direct it to the far back of the room on the floor. Then up to mid level on the wall, and slide it along the wall.\n\nI use my left hand, so I'm then sliding it along the left (east) wall.\n\nYou're playing with it as \"real\", and causing it to pick up a \"topic\" to go with that as a presentation method. I won't go into more details.\n\nIf you can move it along the wall and it doesn't lose any brightness or concreteness, come ask me what to do next to \"manufacture\" things with it.\n\nSilent Knowledge can manufacture things! But unlike the red zone, you can be in the middle and not shifted far to the side, when you get to see such incredible realism.\n\nIn the red zone, you have to shift to the side to see things that real. So you're a bit stupid at that point.  As far gone as our drugged out Mescalito guy in chat who believes the earth is flat.  \n\nHe likes to take drugs and pretend his magic. And insist he's on the \"path with heart\".\n\nOur community is really messed up!\n\nBut that's what a far right horizontal shift in the red zone does. It simulates drug trips. Without the drugs.\n\nBut in SK you can stay in the middle of man's band of emanations, keeping your rationality,  and look right at very concrete magic in front of you.\n\nI made a spaceship out of that stuff once. I posted about it.\n\nLike an idiot, i opened the airlock thinkign it's justt a pretend spaceship, so what danger is there to look out into \"space\".\n\nI got sucked out the airlock and into space!  The only thing left in the room were my feet, hanging onto the edge of the air lock.\n\nMy Ally had to rescue me by grabbing my feet and pulling me back.\n\nIt was zero gravity out there!\n\nAll this I did fully awake walking around, in case any \"sleeping dreamers\" imagine pretending this for themselves.\n\nNope.  I never do anything asleep, that I report here.\n\nI do in fact spend a lot of time in sleeping dreams these days.\n\nI just don't mention it because it's of no use to anyone.", "edited": 1705440683.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ki6mvqt", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversation from Chat, about this post:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt;   Wait Dan is a yellow bright thing in the middle of ur vision (looks like a mini sun) actually a checkpoint on your map?

At any rate, if you see those and they are INTENSE at times, and stable, you&amp;#39;ve reached Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a beginning phase of it.

Dreaming has taken a back seat in the last 2 years, but there is always a pulling feeling towards that world of true exploration (spirit).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_1987ca8", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1987ca8/dream_entry_through_tensegrity/kj1w4zq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1705938009.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1705938009.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kj1kzdg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kizshrq", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Keep in mind, if you kept up your explorations of dreaming, trying to ultimately match the \"new seers\" of our lineage, I can fairly easily calculate how long it would take you, to discover all this.\n\nJust so you know, this is QUITE a technology, and there's no way any single individual messing around on their own, will ever come even a tiny bit close to what they could if they just accepted this technology and learned it.\n\nIt's about like one man trying to recreate all of Computer science, by  themselves.\n\nClearly impossible.\n\nThe \"death defier\" is 8000 years old, and don Juan put the start of our sorcery knowledge (perhaps estimating when drug using Shamans learned to \"see\" and graduated into the realms of real magic) at 10,000 to 8,000 years ago.\n\nSince the Luiseno on the opposite coast up in California have artifacts that are 10,000 years old (I dug some up as a child of 12), one might assume the 10,000 years date is not out of line at all.\n\nSeeing as how humans were in that area around 25,000-35,000 years.

He dreams himself there, then wakes up in his physical body, 1500 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s such a shock, they have to plunge him into a bath of cold water on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Carol Tiggs was waiting there for him to teleport?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had no idea that was going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still, we don&amp;#39;t know the answer to your question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can find out for us??!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m literally no longer interested in &amp;quot;proving&amp;quot; things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s an obsession only beginners have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get advanced, it&amp;#39;s just a mild curiosity which makes you start to believe, we don&amp;#39;t have a clue what&amp;#39;s going on in our own daily reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so you aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;breaking the rules&amp;quot;, but rather realizing you never knew what was going on in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a bit like Neo in &amp;quot;The Matrix&amp;quot; seeing Morpheus doing magic, before he realized that was just a computer generated world, and Morpheus wasn&amp;#39;t actually breaking any physical laws.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1987ca8", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1987ca8/dream_entry_through_tensegrity/kiwzfja/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1705859356.0, "media_metadata": {"92o0qvkvwtdc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpeg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/92o0qvkvwtdc1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bb6e10f8484f8cf84c2a6504eb2660af2c13783"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/92o0qvkvwtdc1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d73af84ab19d4b1d4a01c5db84fa3b611e9d959b"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/92o0qvkvwtdc1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5a8498a285e1700de6bffd1e544c972267e24cc"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/92o0qvkvwtdc1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84660db1f872b120518edc544a6b54218db75044"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/92o0qvkvwtdc1.jpeg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13eb5d81a0f8fa6713c9739fb5ca491e0c2a7292"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/92o0qvkvwtdc1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0382faaf081e5b440dce735f5558ed35d20e524f"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/92o0qvkvwtdc1.jpeg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d91bd57a244fa30a7e01c96c3878ae80be4a2e3c"}, "id": "92o0qvkvwtdc1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kivh4er", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Astro_696", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1705834195.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1987ca8", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_eyhnpmkv5", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Hi, very nice animation.

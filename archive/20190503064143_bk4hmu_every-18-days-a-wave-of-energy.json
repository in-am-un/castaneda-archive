Upon his return he always reached into the mail sacks and pulled out two letters which he then acted upon. Hers had been one of the most recent two. He explained he was excited to be interviewed by her for she was not a member of the established press. He arranged to meet Graciela in California on the UCLA campus... (and) asked that the interview first be published in Spanish which Graciela has done, in the Argentinian magazine (Revista) Mutantia. It was eventually published in the No. 10 - December 1981/ January 1982 issue, the last bimonthly before they began publishing monthly issues. The first 9 issues were published bi-monthly, so the magazine started up mid-1980...and it probably took awhile to get it published since it was a \"surprise\" interview; so Castaneda probably assumed that since he was fairly famous it would be published before August 1981.\r\n\r\n...put him in contact with two people who reported a very interesting experience to him.

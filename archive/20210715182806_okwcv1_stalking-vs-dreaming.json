I just want others to believe I have super powers, because life is too miserable without an audience to sing your praises.\n\nBut stalking isn't what they believe!\n\nStalking is the practice of moving your assemblage point, using behavior.\n\nIn Taisha's \"new\" book (which Cholita had back in 1996 or 97), Zuleica sends Taisha up into a tree house, to hang out with the \"Shadow Beings\" who like that tree.\n\nThey're inorganic beings which prefer trees to humans.\n\nCholita has one in her garden.\n\nTheir advantage over more active inorganic beings is, we can still perceive them. But they don't try to interact with us.\n\nThey let us just watch them. Perhaps for as long as we like.\n\nIt's a \"stable\" second attention manifestation. As long as we can perceive it, our assemblage point remains lower down our back.\n\nAnd as long as it has shifted at least down below the green line on that J curve diagram, they are visible.\n\nIt's kind of hard at the green line though. Better if it's below the red line.\n\nZuleica explains, they are \"stalking the position of the assemblage point\" by doing that.\n\nAnd the witches, in person, talk the same way. There are some lecture notes out there about how you are finding out what the current position of the assemblage point is like, just driving down the street.\n\nThat also is stalking.\n\nBut the absolute ultimate in stalking, if you ask me, is darkroom gazing.\n\nIt's easy to think of it as waking dreaming. And that's certainly a side effect.\n\nBut really, you're using behavior, to move the assemblage point.\n\nAnd then, to hold it in place.\n\nThe result is access to ALL of the magic in the books of Carlos. And ultimately to Silent Knowledge.\n\nSo if you have a choice, and you believe you are \"a stalker\", I ask you.\n\nIs playing dirty tricks on other people, really a superior practice to assembling other worlds?\n\nGet real social media warriors!\n\nYou are NOT a stalker.\n\nBut you could be.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Stalking vs Dreaming", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Stalking"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"0j6lw3ppkeb71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j6lw3ppkeb71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b20ca9206542cce26854e6db4353482d5f6ae4d"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j6lw3ppkeb71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45fd342b0d961b7f3547d6e0a8cc89bbff0aa130"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j6lw3ppkeb71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8c432ef8bd4da705540a31850d50612c6259b22"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j6lw3ppkeb71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ab11d02dde3be4313740dad124f40dee4abf6ea"}], "s": {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j6lw3ppkeb71.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5760a2255bbc2e35ce8658b07fb02dab699a1b39"}, "id": "0j6lw3ppkeb71"}}, "name": "t3_okwcv1", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Stalking", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xQXg1-kLKi6Q9BUUJJ2c37td7LaLPJe6iO-PUKefDI4.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1626366486.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0j6lw3ppkeb71.png?width=640&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5760a2255bbc2e35ce8658b07fb02dab699a1b39\"&gt;That&amp;#39;s the color I first saw in puffs, and the general texture of them, gotten by stalking.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One big confusion in the Castaneda community is regarding what stalking is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, as always, they find the laziest definition which allows them to pretend to be practicing, when in fact they aren&amp;#39;t doing anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;Social Media Warriors&amp;quot;, where the only thing that matters is how much attention or money you can get from others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so if you ask them, &amp;quot;Wouldn&amp;#39;t you like to see some actual visible magic right in your face, and be able to do it for hours a day, anytime you like?

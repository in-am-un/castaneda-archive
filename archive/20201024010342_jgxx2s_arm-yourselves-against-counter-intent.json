It's the myths alone which keep people from sinking to the bottom.\n\nThe myths include very old accounts from people who managed to crawl to the shore and shouted back to the people stuck in the filth.\n\nThrough great effort, some of those managed to get 4 or 5 others to crawl out.\n\nBut they went back in. And they passed around the myth, so they could increase their own allocation of river of filth goodies.  As horrible as the river of filth is, it does contain some things which are considered desirable.\n\nDonuts for example.  Sex for sure.\n\nNow here's a problem. If you manage to climb to the shore and look back, the inhabitants are going to badmouth you. Try to get you back into the river with them.\n\nThey don't want to hear that you can climb out. It hurts their feelings.\n\nAnd maybe their pocket books, if they are river of filth \"hope sellers\".\n\nSo they will lie to you, the way the phantoms lied to Genaro when he stopped the world and couldn't find his way back to Ixtlan.\n\nIn our case the lies are going to be, \"Anyone can do that. It's just the stuff the guys in red hats are doing. Have been for thousands of years. It's nothing special.\"\n\nAnother group of people will insist the \"invaders of the dark dragon realms\" club has other techniques, and your teacher obviously stole them.\n\nThey try to pull your assemblage point back to the mud.\n\nAnd they can!  If you are experienced in dark room gazing, you know that sometimes you need to get up to practice, but you feel sorry for yourself.  You doubt it's even worth it.  You start to feel worry you've been tricked, or you are wasting your time.\n\nCarlos warned us about this.  Search for \"Up from your Toes!\" to see it in the books.\n\nBut, one of the things you learn in darkroom gazing is, that will completely go away if you just get yourself up and start working.\n\nYou'll be traveling to another world, accompanied by your magic spirit teacher.  For real.\n\nIn an hour or two.\n\nAnd when you do, you'll realize that our very being is a position of the assemblage point.\n\nBut you have to get out of bed. That's the key.  That one moment when you have to decide if you're going to go back to sleep, to end the suffering of feeling sorry for yourself.\n\nI suspect that feeling is even worse once you learn to get into heightened awareness.   Because you aren't used to it.\n\nSo here's what you need, to protect yourself from the cult of the red hats, or the invaders of the dragon lairs.\n\nWhen they say this is all old stuff, and stolen material, ask where?\n\nWho's doing it?  Point me to it!\n\nYou'll start to hear, \"Well, uh.  There's plenty! It's all over.\"\n\nBut insist.  Show me on the net.  Show me students who learned. Not a bastard parasite selling mental masturbation.\n\nShow me his students.\n\nYou'll get none.  That's the weird thing.  Don't believe that no one has tried finding it before. Carlos tried.  I tried.  I suspect some of you will become obsessed and try to figure out why there's no magic out there.\n\nYou won't find it.\n\nBut you will get the run around, with people insisting there's lots of \"masters\" all over doing this.\n\nThey claim that because they run from con artist to con artist, thinking that's how you learn.  And finally they become a con artist themselves. It's a \"business\".\n\nIf you really drill down, they point  you to some ancient writings. Or to some mysterious guru who had many followers.\n\nLike Yogananda.  Muktananda.  A famous Zen master.  A legendary Daoist.\n\nBut ask them, if the Daoist \"Hierarchy of Heaven\" is such an amazing thing to view, that it proves your Daoist master is worth listening to, how come he didn't notice, there really is no fixed hierarchy of heaven?\n\nHow come the famous Yogi sees different beings?\n\nHow come the Buddha had even more different characters he encountered?\n\nIf they're so wise, how come they can't agree on reality?\n\nI suppose the excuse is that there are many paths, and many truths.\n\nYou buy that?\n\nA general principle in science is, the simpler explanation tends to be true.\n\nIf you take what they all have in common, and analyze it, you end up with Castaneda's sorcery.\n\nAbsent the bizarre religious nonsense.\n\nSo don't let the people still stuck in the mud, bully you into accepting that what they are doing, in the river of filth, is the best thing you can do.\n\nThe techniques from the books are not copies.  They aren't stolen.\n\nAnd there's no one out there doing them.  There just isn't.\n\nIf there were, it would generate some excitement and it would be visible on the web.\n\nAlso, there's no use for inventory, when it comes to pulling yourself out of the river of filth.\n\nThe huge inventory you carry only makes you sink deeper.\n\nSo the inventory peddlers, the people who will insist Carlos stole this technique, or it's all the same as something else they know more about, are simply people on the verge of sinking to the bottom of the river.\n\nArm yourself!  Don't let the inhabitants spoil your *intent*.\n\nDoubt means, less intent gifts.\n\nAlways shopping for something else means, you must not need anything.\n\nSo less intent gifts.\n\nLooking around as if you haven't yet found the \"best thing\" will reduce your intent gifts.\n\nYou'll end up with even more doubt for your trouble.  Maybe intent will even give you an insight, which leads to further doubt.\n\nYou chose a different path.  The path of dispelling doubt.  So you get doubt gifts.\n\nConfusing yourself thinking, \"this is just that other thing\" means, you'll get the mud of the other thing.\n\nInstead of an  Angel or Demon appearing and offering to help teach you magic (Abramelin reference), you'll get a little pile of shit when you start dark room practice.\n\nMud tracked into your practice area, from the river of filth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Arm Yourselves Against Counter Intent", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Flyers (counter intent)"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_jgxx2s", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Flyers (counter intent)", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1603496404.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1603494222.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live in a river of filth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The river of filth has myths that get passed around, to give people hope.

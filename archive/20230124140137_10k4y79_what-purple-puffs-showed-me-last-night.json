yours.\n\nIt's  just \"knowledge\".\n\nNot \"truth\", and certainly not \"meaningful\".\n\nExcept in that particular state where you had drifted.\n\nOr to make it clear, Silent Knowledge is what makes

doubt it could possibly by a dream.\n\nYou look around, and it's SO real!\n\nSo to test if it's a dream or it's not, you try to examine what you were just doing.\n\nIn one case, I remembered that I was taking my pet cow to market, to sell her.\n\nMirabel, my favorite cow, who was also my wife.\n\nIt seemed \"wrong\" as I thought about it, but then I thought more.  \n\nWhy do I have a cow?\n\nBecause I own that farm over there!  I looked back down the road, and there was my farm.\n\nWith a big red barn.\n\nAnd I could remember painting it.\n\nThat was a flow of \"Silent Knowledge\" about that dream.\n\nAll \"knowledge\".

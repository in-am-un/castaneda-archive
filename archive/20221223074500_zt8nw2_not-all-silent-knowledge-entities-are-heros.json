I wasn't sure how to phrase that. But it turns out, Silent Knowledge can personify the source of \"knowledge\" that you receive, in forms that aren't \"experts\" or kindly spirits wanting to teach you.  Like Porfirio the old maztec indian from the books, who didn't really exist.\n\nBut taught Nestor all about plants and their medicinal uses.\n\nInstead, silent knowledge can cause sad, defeated characters to materialize before you.\n\nAnd before I forget, hopefully you're all familiar with my \"Mr. DoubleTake\".\n\nHe's the one who who lives inside your mind and tries to make cool magic go away.\n\nFor instance, you see something incredible for an instant during darkroom.  Call it one of those \"flash visions\" you see in movies where a woman has the gift of a \"seer\", but none of her friends believe it.\n\nShe touches someone's hand, and \"sees\" a fast vision of him cutting a body up.  He's a serial killer!  But none of her friends realizes it, and they certainly won't believe her.\n\nThe vision is followed by a headache so bad, she has to bend her head down into her hands, to withstand the pain.\n\nTHAT'S \"Mr. DoubleTake\".  At least, an extreme example.\n\nHe's the consequences of seeing something you aren't supposed to see.  He was programmed into you as a \"guardian of reality\" of sorts.  To keep you \"on the right track\" as a child, so  you don't go around believing in monsters under the bed.\n\nAt first he may have been a protector.  Children have no \"shields\" against the unknown.  But also, no realization of how out of place such sights are.  So the sight of something impossible isn't so much a threat to their well being, as an annoyance to the parents.\n\nThe parents create Mr. DoubleTake in his mind, without even realizing they are doing that.  By \"reassuring him\" it's not real.\n\nAnd by the time the child is grown that virtual entity has turned into a petty dictator censoring all aspects of their perception.\n\nMr. DoubleTake can give you a stomach ache right as you've finally achieved such cool \"super powers\" during darkroom, that you feel like Darth Sidious shooting lightning bolts from your fingers.  And sometimes literally can!\n\nBut you have to stop because you have an intense stomach ache.\n\nOr, he just makes your eyes flutter involuntarily, as if to erase or \"shake off\" a sight that can't be real.\n\nIt's actually a cartoon meme.  The \"double take\".  Wile E. Coyote does it all the time, when Roadrunner outwits him and he realizes he's about to fall off a cliff.  Or that he's climbed into a cannon about to fire.\n\nI need a character to represent Mr. DoubleTake  in cartoons. That's what I wanted to ask about.\n\nSuggestions for what Mr. DoubleTake should look like, because it's important to represent him in a cartoon about the topic.\n\nAnd in fact, I saw him just 30 minutes ago!\n\nThere he was.  For real.  Tom Hanks...\n\nHe looked like one of those classic shipwrecked men on a tiny tropical island with only 1 palm tree in the middle.  Standing in ragged clothes, looking out into the ocean for any sign of ships to rescue him.\n\nI believe Tom made a movie like that.  It wasn't up to \"Gump Standards\" though,  meaning \"It ain't no Polar Express\".\n\nSo I never saw it.  Just the promos.\n\nYet, I literally had a man who looked like that standing not 20 feet from me in my dark room.\n\nIt was my level of silence.  HE was.\n\nI realized, I was so silent I was getting flat.  My physical being was \"shrinking\" away.\n\nAnd now worn on the edges of my pant legs.\n\nI'd flattened out due to a level of silence so deep, it became concrete.\n\nA real visual representation of it materialized and I recognized that it was my own Mr. DoubleTake.  Standing right there.\n\nFrom inside me.\n\nMy perspective changed and instead of me being flattened by the force of my silence, out popped a shipwrecked man.\n\nHe's been driving my internal dialogue for a lifetime, but I had finally defeated him for a few minutes.\n\nAnd he looked beaten.\n\nBut what was \"really\" going on?\n\nI was curious.\n\nI glanced away from Mr. DoubleTake who looked very pathetic \"flattened\" like that, just waving in the air like a dirty rag.\n\nI turned to look out into the room.\n\nI was in silent knowledge.  That's what was going on.\n\nA patch of opaque bubbling colors floated by, and behind it was a childhood memory I had recapitulated.\n\nIt was only a shell now.  But the shell still had \"feelings\" left.\n\nI had recalled enough of the memory during recapitulation to \"clear it out\", but the trace feelings were still there.\n\nIn this case, pleasant ones.\n\nA scene materialized, in some odd way.  Or I left the room to stand in the middle of a past event.\n\nI was somewhere near the beach, perhaps in a Nursery along the Pacific Coast highway.\n\nLikely my parents were buying some plants to take home.\n\nBecause I was in silent knowledge, the \"remaining feeling\" from that event converted into a solid entity, in order to answer my question about what exactly that feeling was.\n\nFor those who are new, I hope you have at least read enough of the books to know what \"seeing\" is.\n\nThat's all \"Silent Knowledge\" is.  Carlos just renamed it, to keep us honest.\n\nI suppose he realized there were too many Tai Chi instructors going around saying they'd learned to \"see\" as part of their personal \"magic man franchise\".\n\nTrivializing it, to the point that the entire world concluded Carlos was a fraud.\n\nBased on  endless voices lying about their sorcery skills, where any idiot could see it was all pretend.\n\nSo Carlos warned us, there's no seeing without at least some level of silence.\n\nFortunately, it doesn't take much to get green line effects on our J curve map.  So that  you can realize what \"real\" means, in the context of magic.\n\nI remember a tedious man who came to the subreddit, and tried out his \"bag of tricks\" on us.\n\nHe'd said he'd done \"this\", and \"that\", and one time he and his friend even...\n\nHe had a too long whole story about his amazing accomplishments that he'd gathered together over 20 years, to \"prove\" he had finally succeeded where everyone else had failed.\n\nHe was \"the first person to make the books of Carlos Castaneda work!\"\n\nExcept he hadn't.\n\nI ended up having to reason with him.\n\nAnd at one point he said, \"Oh... You mean REAL magic...\"\n\nYes!  There's no \"visualizing\" in sorcery.  No sacred scroll headaches.\n\nYou literally end up with a shipwrecked guy with ragged pants, standing in the middle of your bedroom.\n\nUninvited.\n\nAnd at first those sorts of things happen only as very short visions, like our \"seer\" woman who gets an intense headache just for viewing magic a few seconds.  And has to stop until she can recover, which can take days.\n\nIt's like that up in the green zone on the J curve.\n\nWe say, \"you got gifted\" when someone lucks out and has a supernatural experience as a beginner.\n\nAnd you did!  Infinity is aware of what you are up to.\n\nBut it doesn't respond to every idle fantasy about being a \"magic man\".\n\nYou  have to work really hard, before it decides to cut you a break and \"gift you\".\n\nBut then the next day, you can't repeat it.\n\nIt's like that at first, and in part Mr. DoubleTake himself is to blame.\n\nIt's a combination of factors however, and I'm only simplifying it for this example.\n\nMr. DoubleTake didn't manage to stop the \"gift\" the night before, until it fully arrived into your consciousness.\n\nMost of the time he can block the view of magic so well that even if you had a visual image it's completely forgotten 1 second later.\n\nBut once you start reducing your internal dialogue, he can't erase stuff that easily.\n\nAnd he knows he \"messed up\" the day before, so when you try to duplicate the same thing the next day he's really on his toes to stop it.\n\nWe say that you are \"anticipating\" the magic, and so you can't repeat it.\n\nOr that your \"link to intent is dirty now\".\n\nAnd those are both true.\n\nBut it's also true that Mr. DoubleTake is now on high alert.\n\nExcept that some day,  eventually, you will defeat him.\n\nAnd find him sad and helpless standing in the middle of your room.\n\nAs a result of levels of silence so deep, that silent knowledge activates on the spot.\n\nSo that ANY trace thought, produces a visible manifestation.\n\nWhile looking at that past memory from my childhood, which I had successfully recapitulated with only some happy trace feeling still remaining, I saw a small boy run by.\n\nHe was behind some plants at the nursery along PCH.\n\nPlaying a game.\n\nAnd when he darted by, I could feel that feeling that still remained.\n\nThe little boy running was fully visible in my darkroom.  The shipwrecked Mr. DoubleTake was on the south side, and the little boy was running on the north end of my room. From behind some plants.\n\nI could feel precisely what he felt, that made him happy.\n\nBut what was it exactly?  It was somewhat \"abstract\".\n\nUndefinable.  Not easily put into words.\n\nAs I tried to \"feel\" what it was, I also activated a \"topic\" for silent knowledge.\n\nSilent Knowledge, or \"seeing\", has unlimited forms.\n\nFor beginners, let me explain that there's only 2 things in existence.\n\nIt's a common mistake to think otherwise.\n\nSorcerers should keep in mind, there's nothing \"above\" or \"in control\" of the emanations.\n\nNo \"higher being\".\n\nIt's true that sorcerers have visualized a giant Eagle, and say that the emanations come from it.\n\nBut then it eats the memories of dead people, and spits out their unwanted awareness to drift into the dark sea of the emanations. To fend for itself.  Which it no longer can, being absent a body.  So that awareness spreads out so thin that you effectively, permanently, die.\n\nIt's a very complicated image that \"Eagle\"!\n\nWhich implies there's a hungry gigantic beast, possibly sitting in a nest laying eggs that are us, or maybe even dropping turds.\n\nAnd it lives near a dark ocean.\n\nIt's hardly just the emanations and awareness flowing into them!\n\nThe problem is, that's an SKE.\n\nA silent knowledge entity.\n\nIt arises as an echo of trace awareness in those emanations.\n\nThe trace awareness which is echoing feelings back to us, which are what give us the perception of something real and visible, is our own \"question\".\n\nIn perfect silence you activate \"seeing\", and knowledge comes to  you.\n\nIn answer to your questions.\n\nSo the Eagle is just the same as the shipwrecked Mr. DoubleTake.\n\nA concrete representation of something you wanted to understand, in order to give you some manageable limits on what it could be.\n\nYou framed a question in your mind, even if it was very subtle, and so the emanations themselves responded to that trace amount of awareness from you, focusing into the dark sea  of the emanations.\n\nKeep in mind, the teacher of our teacher, namely don Juan, suggested we avoid the shipwrecked castaways or Giant Devouring Eagles, and just read text in response to our questions.\n\nNow what fun is that I ask you??!\n\nHowever I must advise you, if you \"follow orders\" the benefits are beyond what you could have anticipated.  Most recommendations by Carlos or don Juan are actually \"tricks\" in the long run.  Clever ways to guide your path, without dirtying your link to intent.\n\nThey're like having a wise uncle tell you to pick him up some bagels on your way to work in the morning.  You feel \"put out\", but that uncle has always been good to you.   So on your way to work in the morning you pick up those bagels, and discover your ideal life partner is working right there. In the bagel shop.\n\nI wish I could do that!  Everything I post risks dirtying your link to intent.\n\nBut that's what it's come down to, so to hell with caution!  It's better than losing it all to greedy dishonest men pretending to understand something they never even got started learning.  To get money from you...\n\nDon Juan's theory being that we could confuse ourselves with Silent Knowledge if we didn't realize, there was nothing important about Mr. Doubletake suffering in defeat.\n\nIt's really not him.  In fact, he's just some bizarre aspect of your own thought process.\n\nThe result of hazing.\n\nLike a nervous tick.\n\nIf you ever took in a stray dog, you can tell when the previous owner abused them.\n\nThey'll flinch and turn away if you move too quickly. As if you were about to smack them in the face.\n\nThat's Mr. DoubleTake.\n\nBut silent Knowledge is like a soup of soups.\n\nA vast container of an infinite number of bubbles floating in space, each one a world in itself.  A tiny reality inside a bubble, with the answer to any question you might have.\n\nAnd when you become so silent that your assemblage point remains at the far end of the J curve, in alignment with that of the energy body (we call it the purple zone), you gain the ability to visibly see the answer to any question you have.\n\nWhich is power you can't imagine,  if abused.\n\nI must admit to having misused it quite a few times.\n\nMy entity \"Fancy\" has felt the results of that.\n\nYou can trap them in Silent Knowledge visions, and make them act out whatever you like, \"solo\".\n\nI suppose for a beginner, it's easier to explain how those nagging phantoms in your dreams, like your 3rd grade teacher chastising you, are actually \"scouts\".\n\nInorganic beings taking advantage of all the \"free bodies\". Dreaming phantoms they didn't have to create, because you already did.  Which they can \"take over\" to interact with you in your sleep.\n\nThey have fun, you have nightmares most of the time.\n\nBut once you attain near perfect silence, it's as if you can rip open space in front of you with your hands,  while awake, look inside the dream world and find your \"scout\".\n\nAnd narrate the dream, from outside it.\n\nLiterally.\n\nYou can force her to act out a half hour show for you, if you can hold silence for that long.\n\nNot to worry.  They get revenge.\n\nBy the way in searching for notes about Phoebus, the ally of Taisha, the subject of vanishing objects came up.\n\nWhen your silence levels are near perfect, objects around you begin to vanish.\n\nNever accuse the IOBs of stealing them.\n\nThe inorganic beings have some rule of \"non-interference\" with humans.\n\nLike Star Trek.\n\nI don't think they're required to follow it however, and they often \"bend the rules\".  Also like Star Trek.\n\nBut there ARE rules.\n\nAnd one is, they don't cause you grief without permission.\n\nBut permission, as I've learned, can come in the form of an object they place in your way.\n\nAnd if you take it, you gave them permission.\n\nSo they have some \"extra rule\" regarding honesty levels.\n\nDon't steal from them, and NEVER accuse THEM of stealing from you.\n\nCarlos wanted to warn us about that.\n\nIt's in the lecture notes.\n\nBut in fact objects can simply vanish, with no reason at all.  Once you can get fully silent.\n\nOr, if you're Cholita.\n\nI believe we're on house keys set #9 at this point.\n\nNaturally Cholita claims I hide them to drive her crazy.\n\nEven though each time I either rush out and make her a duplicate set from the computer kiosk key maker which has them all on record, or I take it from my little drawer of prepared duplicate sets, all there just in case.  Each with a fun keychain figure attached, to keep track of which set it was.  A \"duck\" set, a \"happy face\" set. And so on.  Hopefully she'll like one, and keep better track of it.\n\nI believe there's still 2 sets left!\n\nExcept that Cholita is a witch.\n\nAnd typically what is bothering her,  is not at all what she says.\n\nIt's off in the abstract.\n\nSo her \"missing keys\" are usually just an abstraction and it's up to me to figure out what's really going on.\n\nSometimes it's even her Ally Minx.  Except he didn't steal any keys.\n\nHe prefers chapsticks.\n\nBut back to don Juan, who suggested we simply read text instead of allowing our ability to \"see\" get the best of us.\n\nHe wanted us to become \"Readers of Infinity\".\n\nAnd oddly, if you run into Mr. DoubleTake shipwrecked and all alone you have the power to make that choice right in front of you.\n\nYou are now \"narrating reality\" with your trace thoughts.\n\nThoughts well beyond words.  I guess they're like \"expectations\" more than thoughts.\n\nAnd so while in silence so deep that you reach that state, you \"wonder\" if you have finally gotten fully silent.\n\nAnd you just posed a question!\n\nSo the answer materializes for you because you are \"seeing\".\n\nNope.   That's the answer.  You are not fully silent.\n\nThere's Mr. DoubleTake right there!\n\nHis pants may be tattered and his shirt long gone, and he may even look homeless on a desert island.\n\nBut he's still there.  So no, it's not the deepest level of silence yet.\n\nIn that state, you can \"expect\" to be reading text if you prefer.\n\nInstead of watching visible beings act out the answer.\n\nAnd  your energy body will go rogue, to make it happen.\n\nBut that's another topic.\n\nI'll have to animate that one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Not All Silent Knowledge Entities Are Heros", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"rrv3vdbx4o7a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrv3vdbx4o7a1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc887dd57f8d3e50d3c78a0a81ea18f51e88feea"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrv3vdbx4o7a1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c022f523b8475693ec02412f6fa4161bb306edf"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrv3vdbx4o7a1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=285b683fbc88a53da1e4dacdf0b7a7304cc7b208"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrv3vdbx4o7a1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75bf3419df0dbc27f084f748654f3c67933bc386"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrv3vdbx4o7a1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca98105d4ed9ac182a97e465b688669f9f8c9758"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrv3vdbx4o7a1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53ee78af7b4694474dec5eb744f622e2f42351be"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rrv3vdbx4o7a1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=313cbb8136fadaa72193a1c336f138ef5205e267"}, "id": "rrv3vdbx4o7a1"}}, "name": "t3_zt8nw2", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/IIqVkdp2ltNayTl9GEpVQM3VgbtSy1OlUYLEKx6MOY0.jpg", "edited": 1671811678.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1671777900.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rrv3vdbx4o7a1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=313cbb8136fadaa72193a1c336f138ef5205e267\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/rrv3vdbx4o7a1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=313cbb8136fadaa72193a1c336f138ef5205e267&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a hard post title to come up with.

Standing in ragged clothes, looking out into the ocean for any sign of ships to rescue him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Tom made a movie like that.

Standing right there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From inside me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My perspective changed and instead of me being flattened by the force of my silence, out popped a shipwrecked man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s been driving my internal dialogue for a lifetime, but I had finally defeated him for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he looked beaten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what was &amp;quot;really&amp;quot; going on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was curious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced away from Mr. DoubleTake who looked very pathetic &amp;quot;flattened&amp;quot; like that, just waving in the air like a dirty rag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned to look out into the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in silent knowledge.  That&amp;#39;s what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A patch of opaque bubbling colors floated by, and behind it was a childhood memory I had recapitulated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was only a shell now.  But the shell still had &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot; left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had recalled enough of the memory during recapitulation to &amp;quot;clear it out&amp;quot;, but the trace feelings were still there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case, pleasant ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A scene materialized, in some odd way.  Or I left the room to stand in the middle of a past event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was somewhere near the beach, perhaps in a Nursery along the Pacific Coast highway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likely my parents were buying some plants to take home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because I was in silent knowledge, the &amp;quot;remaining feeling&amp;quot; from that event converted into a solid entity, in order to answer my question about what exactly that feeling was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those who are new, I hope you have at least read enough of the books to know what &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; is.  Carlos just renamed it, to keep us honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose he realized there were too many Tai Chi instructors going around saying they&amp;#39;d learned to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; as part of their personal &amp;quot;magic man franchise&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trivializing it, to the point that the entire world concluded Carlos was a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on  endless voices lying about their sorcery skills, where any idiot could see it was all pretend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Carlos warned us, there&amp;#39;s no seeing without at least some level of silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it doesn&amp;#39;t take much to get green line effects on our J curve map.  So that  you can realize what &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; means, in the context of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember a tedious man who came to the subreddit, and tried out his &amp;quot;bag of tricks&amp;quot; on us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d said he&amp;#39;d done &amp;quot;this&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;, and one time he and his friend even...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had a too long whole story about his amazing accomplishments that he&amp;#39;d gathered together over 20 years, to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; he had finally succeeded where everyone else had failed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was &amp;quot;the first person to make the books of Carlos Castaneda work!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except he hadn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up having to reason with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And at one point he said, &amp;quot;Oh... You mean REAL magic...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes!  There&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;visualizing&amp;quot; in sorcery.  No sacred scroll headaches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You literally end up with a shipwrecked guy with ragged pants, standing in the middle of your bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uninvited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And at first those sorts of things happen only as very short visions, like our &amp;quot;seer&amp;quot; woman who gets an intense headache just for viewing magic a few seconds.  And has to stop until she can recover, which can take days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like that up in the green zone on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We say, &amp;quot;you got gifted&amp;quot; when someone lucks out and has a supernatural experience as a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you did!  Infinity is aware of what you are up to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t respond to every idle fantasy about being a &amp;quot;magic man&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You  have to work really hard, before it decides to cut you a break and &amp;quot;gift you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then the next day, you can&amp;#39;t repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like that at first, and in part Mr. DoubleTake himself is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a combination of factors however, and I&amp;#39;m only simplifying it for this example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. DoubleTake didn&amp;#39;t manage to stop the &amp;quot;gift&amp;quot; the night before, until it fully arrived into your consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the time he can block the view of magic so well that even if you had a visual image it&amp;#39;s completely forgotten 1 second later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you start reducing your internal dialogue, he can&amp;#39;t erase stuff that easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he knows he &amp;quot;messed up&amp;quot; the day before, so when you try to duplicate the same thing the next day he&amp;#39;s really on his toes to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We say that you are &amp;quot;anticipating&amp;quot; the magic, and so you can&amp;#39;t repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or that your &amp;quot;link to intent is dirty now&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And those are both true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s also true that Mr. DoubleTake is now on high alert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that some day,  eventually, you will defeat him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And find him sad and helpless standing in the middle of your room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result of levels of silence so deep, that silent knowledge activates on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that ANY trace thought, produces a visible manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While looking at that past memory from my childhood, which I had successfully recapitulated with only some happy trace feeling still remaining, I saw a small boy run by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was behind some plants at the nursery along PCH.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Playing a game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when he darted by, I could feel that feeling that still remained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little boy running was fully visible in my darkroom.  The shipwrecked Mr. DoubleTake was on the south side, and the little boy was running on the north end of my room. From behind some plants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could feel precisely what he felt, that made him happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what was it exactly?  It was somewhat &amp;quot;abstract&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Undefinable.  Not easily put into words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I tried to &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; what it was, I also activated a &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; for silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge, or &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;, has unlimited forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For beginners, let me explain that there&amp;#39;s only 2 things in existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a common mistake to think otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers should keep in mind, there&amp;#39;s nothing &amp;quot;above&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;in control&amp;quot; of the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No &amp;quot;higher being&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true that sorcerers have visualized a giant Eagle, and say that the emanations come from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then it eats the memories of dead people, and spits out their unwanted awareness to drift into the dark sea of the emanations. To fend for itself.  Which it no longer can, being absent a body.  So that awareness spreads out so thin that you effectively, permanently, die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very complicated image that &amp;quot;Eagle&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which implies there&amp;#39;s a hungry gigantic beast, possibly sitting in a nest laying eggs that are us, or maybe even dropping turds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it lives near a dark ocean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hardly just the emanations and awareness flowing into them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, that&amp;#39;s an SKE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A silent knowledge entity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It arises as an echo of trace awareness in those emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The trace awareness which is echoing feelings back to us, which are what give us the perception of something real and visible, is our own &amp;quot;question&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In perfect silence you activate &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;, and knowledge comes to  you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In answer to your questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the Eagle is just the same as the shipwrecked Mr. DoubleTake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A concrete representation of something you wanted to understand, in order to give you some manageable limits on what it could be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You framed a question in your mind, even if it was very subtle, and so the emanations themselves responded to that trace amount of awareness from you, focusing into the dark sea  of the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, the teacher of our teacher, namely don Juan, suggested we avoid the shipwrecked castaways or Giant Devouring Eagles, and just read text in response to our questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now what fun is that I ask you??!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However I must advise you, if you &amp;quot;follow orders&amp;quot; the benefits are beyond what you could have anticipated.  Most recommendations by Carlos or don Juan are actually &amp;quot;tricks&amp;quot; in the long run.  Clever ways to guide your path, without dirtying your link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re like having a wise uncle tell you to pick him up some bagels on your way to work in the morning.  You feel &amp;quot;put out&amp;quot;, but that uncle has always been good to you.   So on your way to work in the morning you pick up those bagels, and discover your ideal life partner is working right there. In the bagel shop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could do that!  Everything I post risks dirtying your link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s come down to, so to hell with caution!  It&amp;#39;s better than losing it all to greedy dishonest men pretending to understand something they never even got started learning.  To get money from you...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan&amp;#39;s theory being that we could confuse ourselves with Silent Knowledge if we didn&amp;#39;t realize, there was nothing important about Mr. Doubletake suffering in defeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really not him.  In fact, he&amp;#39;s just some bizarre aspect of your own thought process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result of hazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a nervous tick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you ever took in a stray dog, you can tell when the previous owner abused them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll flinch and turn away if you move too quickly. As if you were about to smack them in the face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s Mr. DoubleTake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But silent Knowledge is like a soup of soups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A vast container of an infinite number of bubbles floating in space, each one a world in itself.  A tiny reality inside a bubble, with the answer to any question you might have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you become so silent that your assemblage point remains at the far end of the J curve, in alignment with that of the energy body (we call it the purple zone), you gain the ability to visibly see the answer to any question you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is power you can&amp;#39;t imagine,  if abused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must admit to having misused it quite a few times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My entity &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; has felt the results of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can trap them in Silent Knowledge visions, and make them act out whatever you like, &amp;quot;solo&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose for a beginner, it&amp;#39;s easier to explain how those nagging phantoms in your dreams, like your 3rd grade teacher chastising you, are actually &amp;quot;scouts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inorganic beings taking advantage of all the &amp;quot;free bodies&amp;quot;. Dreaming phantoms they didn&amp;#39;t have to create, because you already did.  Which they can &amp;quot;take over&amp;quot; to interact with you in your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have fun, you have nightmares most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you attain near perfect silence, it&amp;#39;s as if you can rip open space in front of you with your hands,  while awake, look inside the dream world and find your &amp;quot;scout&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And narrate the dream, from outside it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can force her to act out a half hour show for you, if you can hold silence for that long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to worry.  They get revenge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way in searching for notes about Phoebus, the ally of Taisha, the subject of vanishing objects came up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When your silence levels are near perfect, objects around you begin to vanish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never accuse the IOBs of stealing them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inorganic beings have some rule of &amp;quot;non-interference&amp;quot; with humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Star Trek.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re required to follow it however, and they often &amp;quot;bend the rules&amp;quot;.  Also like Star Trek.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there ARE rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one is, they don&amp;#39;t cause you grief without permission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But permission, as I&amp;#39;ve learned, can come in the form of an object they place in your way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you take it, you gave them permission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they have some &amp;quot;extra rule&amp;quot; regarding honesty levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t steal from them, and NEVER accuse THEM of stealing from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos wanted to warn us about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s in the lecture notes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact objects can simply vanish, with no reason at all.  Once you can get fully silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, if you&amp;#39;re Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe we&amp;#39;re on house keys set #9 at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally Cholita claims I hide them to drive her crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though each time I either rush out and make her a duplicate set from the computer kiosk key maker which has them all on record, or I take it from my little drawer of prepared duplicate sets, all there just in case.  Each with a fun keychain figure attached, to keep track of which set it was.  A &amp;quot;duck&amp;quot; set, a &amp;quot;happy face&amp;quot; set. And so on.  Hopefully she&amp;#39;ll like one, and keep better track of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe there&amp;#39;s still 2 sets left!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that Cholita is a witch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And typically what is bothering her,  is not at all what she says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s off in the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So her &amp;quot;missing keys&amp;quot; are usually just an abstraction and it&amp;#39;s up to me to figure out what&amp;#39;s really going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;#39;s even her Ally Minx.  Except he didn&amp;#39;t steal any keys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He prefers chapsticks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But back to don Juan, who suggested we simply read text instead of allowing our ability to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; get the best of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wanted us to become &amp;quot;Readers of Infinity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And oddly, if you run into Mr. DoubleTake shipwrecked and all alone you have the power to make that choice right in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are now &amp;quot;narrating reality&amp;quot; with your trace thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thoughts well beyond words.  I guess they&amp;#39;re like &amp;quot;expectations&amp;quot; more than thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so while in silence so deep that you reach that state, you &amp;quot;wonder&amp;quot; if you have finally gotten fully silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you just posed a question!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the answer materializes for you because you are &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope.   That&amp;#39;s the answer.  You are not fully silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s Mr. DoubleTake right there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His pants may be tattered and his shirt long gone, and he may even look homeless on a desert island.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he&amp;#39;s still there.  So no, it&amp;#39;s not the deepest level of silence yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that state, you can &amp;quot;expect&amp;quot; to be reading text if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of watching visible beings act out the answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And  your energy body will go rogue, to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s another topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll have to animate that one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "1a0d5e9c-6005-11ea-8472-0e86798f0183", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "zt8nw2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 20, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zt8nw2/not_all_silent_knowledge_entities_are_heros/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/zt8nw2/not_all_silent_knowledge_entities_are_heros/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1671777900.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j1ejphc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1671821499.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_zt8nw2", "score": 10, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Let me suggest something we might have missed.\n\nI'm pretty sure, if it's true, that we all at least \"noticed\" it.\n\nAs being strange.\n\nBut as I've said in the past, Carlos banned me from reading the books.\n\nOtherwise I would have read this recently ( &lt; 20 years ago) and know if this is true.\n\nBut I don't. So I'll \"propose it\".\n\nI believe, and maybe some of you will know, that there's some very odd explanations going on in the books about the origin of specific practices.\n\nIn particular, recapitulation.\n\n I believe the story goes, the old seers became seers FIRST.\n\nAnd THEN discovered recapitulation.\n\nWe tend to think of recap as a \"burden\" you have to bear, if you want to be a seer.\n\nSo how could someone become a seer first, and discover recap later?\n\nAnd even care about doing it at that point!\n\nDon't need it to reach silent knowledge!  Since they were already there.\n\nThe answer is in this post.\n\nBecause, IT'S SO DARNED COOL!\n\nSilent Knowledge.\n\nAnd once you can \"see\", you realize that all past memories hold a wealth of amazing magic.\n\nWhy wouldn't you greedily explore every single memory in order to relive it live, seeing as how all you have to do is \"consider\" it a tiny bit and the history materializes right in front of you.  As videos.\n\nOR, you actually ARE there in the past, watching it as if you were that person again.  Like that little boy in this post.\n\nI was there!\n\nAnd you can even travel into the past, with a fellow sorcerer.  Both of you can watch the memories.\n\nSo \"seers\" inevitably discover recap!

You are recapitulating events and at some point the events seem to be \"located\" in the scan range of your sweeping head.\n\nThat's one reason I DON'T recommend the \"shortened head scan\".\n\nWe had a bad player in here telling beginners that Taisha barely moves her head at all.

You need the \"space\" in front of you.\n\nYou need a FULL car windshield. Not just a little patch where you scraped a hole through the ice you found on your windshield in the morning.\n\nCan't navigate through a little hole.\n\nMostly because,  recap will do the same as sitting on pillows on the bed.  \n\nAllow you to gaze around looking for \"energy\".  The infamous \"seeing energy\".\n\nYou'll \"notice\" a strong memory. Or strong something.\n\nAnd you turn to look that direction, interrupting your head sweep, and into a dream you go.\n\nA past event.\n\nBut don't be disappointed if it's not that dreamatic.\n\nI kind of like drauma!\n\nYou could also just find yourself looking down from the sky, and a dream vision below you.  Which materializes  very slowly.\n\nLucidity is guaranteed as long as you stay in that vision.  I'm not so sure about \"sky dreaming\" though.  Haven't done it enough.\n\nBut inside the dream?  It's easy to stay lucid.\n\nWithin reason.  I'd say more than 3 hours puts you at risk of losing lucidity.\n\nLess is a piece of cake!  As long as you pay attention.\n\nSo recap also allows \"re-runs\", and  they aren't confined to you.\n\nOr to humans!  You can recap a saber toothed tiger if you live near some the way Carlos did. His apartment complex was SURROUNDED by them if you went back pre-ice age.\n\nAnd if you recapitulation an animal, it can become your \"totem\".\n\nAn obscure topic that Cleargreen seemed to seize upon a few years back, maybe because of some male figure they temporarily picked up.\n\nOr maybe because Miles felt it was easier to pretend magic if cute fuzzy animals were involved.\n\nBut in fact, you establish a \"link\" to that animal, and now it becomes a silent knowledge entity.  Into the future.\n\nCarlos used to hang out with one.\n\nFor real!!!  Not in his \"mind's eye\" the way Cleargreen seemed to be trying to claim for a while there.\n\nNaturally you can't get away with stuff like that without the IOBS taking an interest.\n\nAnd unfortunately, they can take over SKEs also.\n\nI haven't figured out when.\n\nMaybe SKEs go \"non-lucid\" as you run out of energy, making them just phantoms the IOBs can occupy?\n\nAn SKE is an odd form of an extension of yourself.\n\nPulled out of your own band of human emanations.", "edited": 1672070545.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j1qbn9a", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You aren&amp;#39;t limited to recapitulating humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you could recapitulate don Juan for example, as Carlos did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He commented that he saw events in &amp;quot;more detail than I had a right to&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess he saw don Juan adjust his underwear?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, a &amp;quot;re-run&amp;quot; can take place any time of day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like there&amp;#39;s an Island called, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m recapitulating now&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a completely different island called, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sitting up on pillows, gazing into darkness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; re-run might be, while gazing at the whitish light on surfaces which becomes visible in heightened awareness, you &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;re so silent you don&amp;#39;t mess it up by thinking, &amp;quot;What the hell was that???

Haven&amp;#39;t done it enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But inside the dream?  It&amp;#39;s easy to stay lucid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within reason.  I&amp;#39;d say more than 3 hours puts you at risk of losing lucidity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Less is a piece of cake!  As long as you pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So recap also allows &amp;quot;re-runs&amp;quot;, and  they aren&amp;#39;t confined to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or to humans!  You can recap a saber toothed tiger if you live near some the way Carlos did. His apartment complex was SURROUNDED by them if you went back pre-ice age.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you recapitulation an animal, it can become your &amp;quot;totem&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An obscure topic that Cleargreen seemed to seize upon a few years back, maybe because of some male figure they temporarily picked up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe because Miles felt it was easier to pretend magic if cute fuzzy animals were involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, you establish a &amp;quot;link&amp;quot; to that animal, and now it becomes a silent knowledge entity.  Into the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos used to hang out with one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For real!!!  Not in his &amp;quot;mind&amp;#39;s eye&amp;quot; the way Cleargreen seemed to be trying to claim for a while there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally you can&amp;#39;t get away with stuff like that without the IOBS taking an interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately, they can take over SKEs also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t figured out when.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe SKEs go &amp;quot;non-lucid&amp;quot; as you run out of energy, making them just phantoms the IOBs can occupy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An SKE is an odd form of an extension of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pulled out of your own band of human emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_zt8nw2", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zt8nw2/not_all_silent_knowledge_entities_are_heros/j1qbn9a/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1672068923.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1672068923.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j1pq5f3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "EducationalCorner118", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j1egds1", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_bdcaqqn6", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "What do you mean with animal totems?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j1pq5f3", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you mean with animal totems?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_zt8nw2", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zt8nw2/not_all_silent_knowledge_entities_are_heros/j1pq5f3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1672055731.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1672055731.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j1egds1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j1ebuhf", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I'll animate recapitulation.\n\nI've explained it over and over, but it's too hard for people to go find and read all of those posts and comments.\n\nRecap is AWESOME.\n\nIt's just like in the books.

Teach infants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what we do is have SHEER NUMBERS of people come here, and we don&amp;#39;t allow anything but real learning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We daily fight off any attempts to change it into something easier to pretend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, anyone who succeeds in here (1 in 500 who bother to subscribe is my estimate), those seers will have had to fight for every single inch of progress, along the 100  mile road to sorcery knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AND, they will understand why magic can&amp;#39;t exist outside our sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, not for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they&amp;#39;ll have seen how outside influences constantly try to destroy this place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And how people who believe they have learned something real elsewhere, fail horribly in here. With the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re building a form of Olmec sorcery never before seen on this earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Failures and &amp;quot;issues&amp;quot; are good.

He called it, &amp;quot;The blue pearl&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uh...  Except many see those!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yogananda&amp;#39;s church uses one as the symbol in Orange county. It&amp;#39;s over the top of the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t actually see them much.  It&amp;#39;s just more yoga pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Thailand some believe the &amp;quot;blue ball&amp;quot; will expand, open up, and out will come your guru.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that happens, don&amp;#39;t give him your credit card number!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s Patanjali&amp;#39;s technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In perfect inner silence, FAR past ordinary green level &amp;quot;bliss&amp;quot;, just say, &amp;quot;inner lights&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MUST be past the red zone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then drop it, and forget you said it. Return to absolute silence, which Patanjali called &amp;quot;Samadhi&amp;quot;, because he was a Hindu religious nut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was &amp;quot;Mr. Bookdeal&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, book deal bad players steal from older material, so if the book deal was more than 400 years ago, it&amp;#39;s worth paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have access to the best old books on magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We only have bad player repeats, or repeats, of echos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they are worth studying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First inner light comes as red, then white, then the blue dot?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can easily find this on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;Siddhi Powers&amp;quot; all yoga cults use for &amp;quot;advanced Workshops&amp;quot; costing $5000 each.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When people pay to learn to meditate (can be $2000!), then they realize it&amp;#39;s just miserable green line stuff, and not even continuously, they can be sold an &amp;quot;advanced technique&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chopra was an &amp;quot;advanced technique&amp;quot; teacher for Maharishi, but then Opra turned him into a super star.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All he did was tell you, instead of repeating &amp;quot;Aing&amp;quot;,  now you should repeat, &amp;quot;Aing Nama&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you were dumb enough to buy that, he&amp;#39;d sell you &amp;quot;Shri Aing Nama&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then when people started to realize advanced techniques were pointless and very expensive they sold them &amp;quot;The Siddhi Program&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretending they&amp;#39;d teach you to fly like Milarepa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, they&amp;#39;re idiots.  So no one actually flew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done that many times, and as far as I can tell, you have to switch to the double and shrink the tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t fly just because you closed your eyes and are repeating lame mantras.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to move your assemblage point far away from where Maharishi could move his, until &amp;quot;the double becomes visible&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s deep orange zone stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where Yogis likely NEVER reach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THEN, you can make all of the techniques of Patanjali work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, they&amp;#39;ll be trivial and obvious at that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yoga Butt.  All I&amp;#39;m saying...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s hinduism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a 22 year old &amp;quot;girlfriend&amp;quot; who went to Yoga daily, and I got to pick her up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trust me, it was yoga butt all class long.  Too bad the men were gay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or at least that&amp;#39;s what makes it more popular in my half of California.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason":

That&amp;#39;s just getting &amp;quot;slimmed&amp;quot; in the green zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when he got a crummy view of an IOB with his eyes closed,  he fell for it hook, line, and sinker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Swallowed the bait,  and it became one of the most &amp;quot;esoterically pornographic&amp;quot; tales to people confused by Dzogchen and the Dali Lama.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find groupies on that &amp;quot;The Tibetan Yogis&amp;quot; video on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All eagerly learning to sit with  eyes closed, and &amp;quot;deny yourself stuff&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get a crappy vision of an IOB who&amp;#39;s tricking you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Milarepa got taken to &amp;quot;hell&amp;quot;, and was so clueless he blamed the IOBs for torturing lost souls there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We lost our only Nagual Tony to that absolute crap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to think, &amp;quot;But Milarepa could fly!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until I realized, we do that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;La Gorda&amp;#39;s technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not only can we fly, but far outside our galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With our eyes open!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After having a nice all you can eat buffet and some wine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But &amp;quot;Milarepa&amp;quot; is a famous &amp;quot;sage&amp;quot; of Buddhism?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Delusional crap!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we&amp;#39;ll go kick flier butt if we get lucky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find something &amp;quot;worse&amp;quot; than fliers, and lead it to their world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could try &amp;quot;plagues&amp;quot; on them, like Moses did to the Egyptians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until they agree to &amp;quot;let my people go free&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_vc76v7", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/vc76v7/what_is_happening_to_me/iclqf6k/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1655399369.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "icloznh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "JoJoAMenaceFr", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iclero8", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_ma543cpg", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Damn that excuse does seem pretty lame.

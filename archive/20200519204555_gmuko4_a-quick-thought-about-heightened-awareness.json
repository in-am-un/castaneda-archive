He just says he was visiting Carlos on some Mexican events, and had private conversations with him, and before leaving the world he introduced him to some lineage of old seers who are moving in a different direction than don Juan's lineage. From what I know he is not a public person and his books are not really popular, no events or workshops.\n\nBut in his first book he tells that Carlos left to him the task to say to people that The Rule still applies and that his task as a Nagual was to disseminate knowledge so that new Rule-based lineages could form on their own, based on the minimal chance given in the books. Like that:\n\r\n\"I have lived a moment of renewal. My task is to close the lineage of Don Juan with a \r\ngolden key, and to open up possibilities for those who come later. That is why I have said \r\nthat I am the last nagual of my lineage, not in an absolute sense, but in the sense of \r\nradical change.\" \r\nAt this point, Carlos took a break in his presentation and reminded me of a conversation \r\nwe had when we first met. \r\nAt that time, I had asked him to tell me tales of power. He replied that he could not refuse \r\nwhat I was asking, but to hand over those stories without any directions would have been \r\nto trivialize them. \r\n\"I hope what you have seen during these years fulfills your expectations. I did what I \r\ncould, considering your limitations as \r\nwell as mine. I know you have already begun to train your dreaming double, and that \r\nguarantees that you can continue by yourself; your double won't leave you alone until \r\nyou arrive at your totality. The theoretical part is finished, and it is time to give you a last \r\ngift.\" \r\nThe tone of Carlos' voice as he spoke these words, somewhere between familiar and \r\nsolemn, made me concentrate all my attention. \r\n\"The final teaching says that in connection with intent, every person, whoever it may be, \r\nwho approaches the nagual, has his place inside the total context of the Rule. So you are \r\nnot alone; sorcerers are expecting something from you.\" \r\n\"What?\" I asked, a little confused. He explained:\n\"All warriors have a task. Yours is to fulfill what the spirit told you to do; that is your \r\npath to power.\" \r\n\"And what is that task?\" \r\n\"Well, your personal mission is something your benefactor will communicate to you \r\nsome day. However, in accordance with the Rule of the three-pronged nagual, I am \r\nfollowing a long-term strategy devised by Don Juan, which commits you to my teacher's \r\nintent. \r\n\"What is expected from you is that you say to those who surround you: 'You are free, you \r\ncan fly by yourselves!

So it is like that.", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_frdwzbs", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s his story?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is not claiming to be a Nagual. He just says he was visiting Carlos on some Mexican events, and had private conversations with him, and before leaving the world he introduced him to some lineage of old seers who are moving in a different direction than don Juan&amp;#39;s lineage. From what I know he is not a public person and his books are not really popular, no events or workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in his first book he tells that Carlos left to him the task to say to people that The Rule still applies and that his task as a Nagual was to disseminate knowledge so that new Rule-based lineages could form on their own, based on the minimal chance given in the books. Like that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have lived a moment of renewal. My task is to close the lineage of Don Juan with a \ngolden key, and to open up possibilities for those who come later. That is why I have said \nthat I am the last nagual of my lineage, not in an absolute sense, but in the sense of \nradical change.&amp;quot; \nAt this point, Carlos took a break in his presentation and reminded me of a conversation \nwe had when we first met. \nAt that time, I had asked him to tell me tales of power. He replied that he could not refuse \nwhat I was asking, but to hand over those stories without any directions would have been \nto trivialize them. \n&amp;quot;I hope what you have seen during these years fulfills your expectations. I did what I \ncould, considering your limitations as \nwell as mine. I know you have already begun to train your dreaming double, and that \nguarantees that you can continue by yourself; your double won&amp;#39;t leave you alone until \nyou arrive at your totality. The theoretical part is finished, and it is time to give you a last \ngift.&amp;quot; \nThe tone of Carlos&amp;#39; voice as he spoke these words, somewhere between familiar and \nsolemn, made me concentrate all my attention. \n&amp;quot;The final teaching says that in connection with intent, every person, whoever it may be, \nwho approaches the nagual, has his place inside the total context of the Rule. So you are \nnot alone; sorcerers are expecting something from you.&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; I asked, a little confused. He explained:\n&amp;quot;All warriors have a task. Yours is to fulfill what the spirit told you to do; that is your \npath to power.&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;And what is that task?&amp;quot; \n&amp;quot;Well, your personal mission is something your benefactor will communicate to you \nsome day. However, in accordance with the Rule of the three-pronged nagual, I am \nfollowing a long-term strategy devised by Don Juan, which commits you to my teacher&amp;#39;s \nintent. \n&amp;quot;What is expected from you is that you say to those who surround you: &amp;#39;You are free, you \ncan fly by yourselves! You have the necessary information, what are you waiting for? \nAct impeccably, and see how energy finds a way.&amp;#39; \n&amp;quot;Warn everyone that with the culmination of Don Juan&amp;#39;s lineage, the knowledge is wide \nopen.

So why would you bother with dreaming asleep?\n\nBecause it's more encompassing.  Every tiny piece of your body is inside the second attention.\n\nWith waking dreaming, only what you're currently messing with is in the second attention.\n\nFor example, Fairy has taken me to her world at least 6 times.\n\nUsually it starts to manifest on my southern wall, and Fairy flies in.\n\nHer color changes when she crosses the threshold.\n\nTypically I only reach in there with my arm.\n\nSo my body is in the first attention, my arm in the second attention.\n\nBut the other day, Fairy asssembled her world around me.

She took it literally, since I did in fact request it.\n\nI honestly believe, they need permission.\n\nThe permission can be a mistake on your part.  A careless remark.\n\nOr it can be on purpose, such as the dreaming recommendation to find a scout, and ask it to take you to it's world.\n\nOr, you can relinquish decision making to someone else, such as a Nagual leader, and that leader can make requests on your behalf, as far as the IOBs go.\n\nBut in sleeping dreaming, it's probably not a worry to ask them one time, since don Juan recommended it.\n\nThe problem with sleeping dreaming is, it's not going to convince anyone else that Carlos was the real thing.\n\nNo one will care what you do in your dreams.\n\nBut while awake, that can be quite convincing since it matches up with the descriptions Buddhists and Hindus give, for the cool things their most famous saints could do.\n\nThus my obsession, which does not have to be  yours.\n\nRemember, OBSESSION is how you get more dreaming.\n\nThe residue of your first attention, inside the dream, has to be more single minded.\n\nIt only has 5% influence, so its entire desire has to be to wake up and become lucid.\n\nMile's \"Set up Dreaming\" technique is really just *intending* an obsession.\n\nBut just thinking about it all day long is also an excellent way to \"set up dreaming\".\n\nYou don't need a stick, unless you like that kind of thing.\n\nPerhaps Cleargreen #1 and #2 are stuck in rituals, because they haven't put in the effort to venture into new territory?\n\nI just heard from one of their followers about Victor.\n\nThey haven't even warned students away from Armando, Miguel, and Victor????\n\nAdd no understanding of *intent* to my list of complaints about them.\n\nThey should have warned people off.\n\nBut in the Eastern Bloc, all of those guys are considered good sources of information!\n\nEdited", "edited": 1590074910.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_frckwyk", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sure sounds like an IOB to me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, if it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;being&amp;quot;, and has no organic body, it&amp;#39;s always technically an IOB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just might also be a phantom, meaning, only your &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; created it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope  you keep this up!

It was not on the wall as usual. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It materialized and I was already a ways inside it.  It just surrounded me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could see the bedroom if I turned around, but in front of me was Fairy herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In her home.  Some hole in a weird tube or dirt mound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that case, I was fully submerged in the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very different than being halfway in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t anyone get worried that the IOBs want to kidnap us!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that case, I had specifically asked Fairy to be more close to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was her answer. She took it literally.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had only meant, don&amp;#39;t spend all of your time with Cholita!  Come see me more often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But IOBs are a little dense I suspect.  She took it literally, since I did in fact request it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly believe, they need permission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The permission can be a mistake on your part.  A careless remark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or it can be on purpose, such as the dreaming recommendation to find a scout, and ask it to take you to it&amp;#39;s world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, you can relinquish decision making to someone else, such as a Nagual leader, and that leader can make requests on your behalf, as far as the IOBs go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in sleeping dreaming, it&amp;#39;s probably not a worry to ask them one time, since don Juan recommended it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with sleeping dreaming is, it&amp;#39;s not going to convince anyone else that Carlos was the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one will care what you do in your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But while awake, that can be quite convincing since it matches up with the descriptions Buddhists and Hindus give, for the cool things their most famous saints could do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus my obsession, which does not have to be  yours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, OBSESSION is how you get more dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The residue of your first attention, inside the dream, has to be more single minded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It only has 5% influence, so its entire desire has to be to wake up and become lucid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mile&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Set up Dreaming&amp;quot; technique is really just &lt;em&gt;intending&lt;/em&gt; an obsession.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But just thinking about it all day long is also an excellent way to &amp;quot;set up dreaming&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need a stick, unless you like that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Cleargreen #1 and #2 are stuck in rituals, because they haven&amp;#39;t put in the effort to venture into new territory?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just heard from one of their followers about Victor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They haven&amp;#39;t even warned students away from Armando, Miguel, and Victor????&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Add no understanding of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; to my list of complaints about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They should have warned people off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the Eastern Bloc, all of those guys are considered good sources of information!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_gmuko4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gmuko4/a_quick_thought_about_heightened_awareness/frckwyk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1590073980.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1590073980.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "frb5u7r", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1590033454.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fr90oa7", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gmuko4/a_quick_thought_about_heightened_awareness/frb5u7r/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_frb5u7r", "created": 1590033454.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fr90oa7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1589989656.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fr7oln7", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Anything you do, *intending* to learn sorcery, will have an effect somewhere.\n\nCarlos even advised us to do nonsensical things, which required a bit of work, and suspension of disbelief.\n\n&gt;Spend time scooping?\n\nGazing and silence in the chair work faster, until you can get silent.\n\nOnce you can get silent, scooping colors is pretty fast.\n\nBut if you try to scoop them while not silent, the results will be worse than just returning to the chair, or doing gazing.\n\nNone of this applies to women, although they could certainly take that path, and do better than if they don't.\n\nBut they won't.

I started to accumulate too much fascinating information, and was worried if I'd be able to keep it.\n\nI hadn't seen any inorganic beings for perhaps an hour, and started to wonder if maybe they can't appear while you are viewing endless images, sounds, places, and feelings.\n\nMaybe they can't enter there with you.\n\nI had a silly thought.  Too bad there isn't a space suit for inorganic beings.  I could sure use some clarity about all this.\n\nSuddenly Lily, my friendly inorganic being of unknown origin,  floated in from the right at eye level.  She had an odd pink cloud of light surrounding her like a protective barrier.\n\nI commented to her that I was very happy to see her.  And did she have any idea what just happened.  Lily had been the first inorganic being to appear that night, showing up not more than 3 seconds after I began practicing.  I just wiggled my fingers in the location of the second attention's assemblage point, and she materialized right near my fingers.\n\n\"Should I even tell anyone?\", I asked her. Maybe that would be like \"spoilers\".\n\nShe said, telling makes you a scout.  That can become a habit, and a responsibility.  But the dark sea is so vast, it's silly to worry about telling too much.\n\nDon't you remember Emilito's \"Tales of Eternity\"?\n\nLong journeys are always more fun when you hear of the sights ahead.\n\n\"But what of the Wuwonians?\", I asked her.  \"That's complete nonsense!\"\n\nShe seemed disappointed in me.  \"You missed the point entirely!\", she exclaimed.\n\nEarlier I had reached silent knowledge in record time. It still took a couple of hours, but reaching the very deep orange level where silent knowledge appears, can take as many as 8 hours. All of intense silence.  To get there in substantially less than 2 is a very good development.\n\nIt wasn't disappointing.  The entire room was filled with scenes and information, including sound in some cases.\n\nObjects were also appearing, summoned by my gaze. But not like the phantom objects you can materialize in the whitish light, or can find inside a brilliant purple puff in the red zone.\n\nThese were as intense as the little blue dots people see, except they were the size very large donuts, floating a few feet in front of me just about anywhere I looked.  The act of looking there would cause one to appear, and they were stable enough to examine as long as I wanted.\n\nWhile looking at a particularly interesting one, I heard a voice.\n\nIt's impossible to recall for reasons that may become clear later.  I even tried to figure out how to repeat the story shortly after I heard it, but could not come up with an accurate account.\n\nThe best I can do is to say, a voice said, \"The pink mirthful Wuwonains decided to visit the blue people. The larger of the two had decided...\"\n\nI had fallen into the flow of the story for an instant.  The words created a very joyful feeling of happiness and fondness for the wuwonians.  I remembered how much enjoyment they had brought everyone who heard their tales.  As if they were real beings.\n\nBut then I sort of \"snapped out of the spell\", and began to think about how absurd that was.  \"This can't be silent knowledge!\", I concluded.\n\nI tried to perceive who was interfering with the flow of silent knowledge by glancing back to the story teller, instead of continuing to look at the story itself.   I didn't quite realize, due to my level of silence, that even the act of glancing back at the story teller, while the story was still visible in the air, was amazing magic.\n\nIt just seemed perfectly normal to be able to do that.\n\nThe story teller was sitting in a big comfortable chair, wearing a sweater.  If I didn't know better, I would think it was Mr. Rogers, or one of those Hallmark movie channel old fashioned stories, which has a famous host holding a book while he explains the next scene.\n\nI complained to Lily.  Both the story, and the story teller, made absolutely no sense.\n\n\"How is that Silent Knowledge?\", I asked her.\n\n\"But you missed that entirely!\", she criticized.\n\nShe explained.\n\nIn the past, on this world, words had more power. But now, not as much.\n\nIn Silent Knowledge, time has no meaning.  It's everything available to man, which even includes the non-human, as long as man can perceive that.\n\nThe storyteller comes from a place where the words still have  power. He's a story sorcerer.\n\n\"How lame!\", I thought to myself.  \"What kind of crappy magic is that?\"\n\nLily looked pained.\n\n\"You look everywhere you were taught to look, and nowhere you were not!   If you continue like that, it will take you forever to learn..\"\n\nShe explained.  Sorcery all stems from one thing.  Every bit of it.  Once you start to learn about *intent*, you need the recapitulation to recover your energy and reduce stray influences.  And you need to be in good health, or you can't travel very far.  So you need energy exercises.  Tensegrity.  And you need to protect yourself from outsiders, and hold your gains. So there's stalking.\n\nIt all flows from that single thing, an attempt to master intent.\n\nDidn't it occur to you that while cleaning your link to *intent*, your mistakes are also corrected? The mood of sorcerers is soaked in Silent Knowledge.  It stems from it.  It's inevitable even.\n\nThe story of the Wuwonians is not about Wuwonians.\n\nIts about the power of mirth.  The story isn't about the words, but about the mood they produce, and the reality vistas those summon before your eyes.  And the audience for the story is not just you.  It's the spirit itself!  The mirth of the Wuwonians is so pure and innocent, it even moves the Eagle itself.   It's one of the important components of *intending*!\n\n\"What did you see?\",  Lily asked.\n\nI related that I had in fact seen what the Wuwonians were wearing and it was so silly, it made me laugh.  It wasn't that they looked foolish.  It was the very fact that they managed to pull it off.  No one who saw the Wuwonians could wish for them to dress any differently.\n\nAs I explored that feeling, I saw a group of people enjoying the story and sharing the pleasure of the company of other beings.  Then I saw the people turn their heads to look back at the Wuwonians,  to continue the story.  And it was obvious the Wuwonians were preparing for a road trip.  They had a big, silly car.  I got images of their car bouncing down the road like a boat, with the Wuwonians waving to passers by.\n\n\"That's it!\", Lily exclaimed.\n\nYou could only see the story itself,  and it's value or lack of value in  your world.  When you couldn't find the value for such an absurd tale, you looked to see if the story teller was reliable.  Could he be trusted?\n\nAll you could think about is what you could gain from this.\n\nDoing that will blind you to the value of Silent Knowledge. It's beyond your flaws and limitations as a being of just one realm.  You get to see what people do in all realms.  Human or not.\n\nLily continued.  The story teller is a famous magician from their world. His ability to produce tiny pieces of reality in the air, as vivid as the real world, is why he's sought out.\n\nI asked Lily if I could have talked to him.\n\nLily responded, \"This isn't what **is**.  Just what **could be**.  You can't talk to the story teller for real.  If you could, what horrors could be unleashed!\"\n\n\"He's just for viewing, unless you want to change things up.\"\n\nI had realized that point.  Silent Knowledge seems to be malleable as far as \"presentation\" goes.  it's continuous knowledge, but how you receive it is somewhat your choice.\n\n\"Exactly!\", Lily said.  She explained she'd been a little worried about me, because I seemed too dense to make a good scout.  She added, \"Cholita makes an excellent scout. She doesn't care about rationality at all.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be a scout!\", I complained.\n\n\"It's your choice, but you've been living off the benefits of scouts for nearly your entire life.  You only got in to this sorcery business, because someone scouted ahead and told you stories of the road,  to motivate you.\"\n\nI realized Carlos had told us the same thing.  He said we should stop reading the books of Carlos Castaneda, because he only wrote those to hook us.  Now we were hooked.  And we had the real thing in front of us   So stop reading them.\n\nI had an odd question for Lily.  So many other things had happened and I hadn't figured out if they were real or not.\n\nLily went on, \"Don Juan warned you about this, but you didn't get it.\"\n\nI asked her,  \"When?\".\n\nShe explained, \"You just read it yesterday.  Don Juan suggested that being a modern man, Carlos was a reader.  He had a choice to view scenes when in Silent Knowledge, as the Olmecs tended to do, but maybe he should consider viewing Silent Knowledge as text he can read.\"\n\nI commented that I was way ahead of her, and had already realized that between don Juan telling him that, and now, with cellphones, we're no longer \"readers\".\n\nWe're \"media consumers\".\n\nI thought I had made a good point.\n\nLily looked pained.\n\n\"You still didn't get it.  You always look at either the story, or the story teller, and never in between.\n\nSorcerers have to look through the cracks! That's what turns ordinary people into sorcerers in the first place.  Noticing that people don't have to live one way or the other because there's some variety in that. So a sorcerer looks between those views to find what's behind it all, hoping to escape to a better place.\"\n\nShe explained.  Don Juan's suggestion was not about the details of his recommendations.\n\nIt was about choice.  Don Juan was letting the readers of the books of Carlos Castaneda know, they had a choice.\n\nSilent Knowledge can never flow to us in it's pure form. It's just an interaction on the emanations.  A vibration of sorts.  Like a harmonic ringing on an infinite number of musical instrument strings, each tuned to a unique frequency. And yet the ringing is more pleasant to hear than any individual string.  It conveys information beyond the sound of each string.\n\nBut we can never absorb that directly. So it has to be filtered.\n\nWe select the method of receiving the information.\n\n\"Those women's  voices!\" I commented.\n\nShe went on.  Yes, those voices.  You wondered where was the story teller's voice coming from.\n\nYou gazed off to look at him, again not realizing the absurdity of having the story still floating in the air to the right of you, and instantly knowing which direction had a \"being\" sitting in a comfy chair telling that story.\n\nThen you did exactly what don Juan was trying to tell us. You exercised choice.\n\nYour pocket of realty expanded, there was space beyond the story teller, outside your own home,  and you glanced off past him to try to understand.\n\nYou were assembling an entire world freely, piece by piece.  The same way Cholita expands her phantom copy of your home.  And all just to understand a single point!  Nothing you have ever seeing in the darkroom, is anywhere near that.  The interplay of the emanations themselves, became available to your mind.\n\nTHAT'S silent knowledge.  It's a way of understanding things which has no limits on what you are able to think.  It's just at the level of knowing.  And without the words limiting things, you get scenes. Phantom worlds.  Temporary constructs of realness.  All designed just to help you understand something.\n\nTo \"know\" it.\n\n\"And the voices?\", I asked her.  \"Were they real\"?\n\nLily said that was the best part, but I didn't even notice.  I had changed the presentation of Silent Knowledge!\n\nBy wondering about where the voice had come from, and was it real, I began to get silent knowledge on where voices come from, and whether they are real.\n\nA very odd topic for sure, but there is still knowledge available on that one.\n\nit was almost like asking a library clerk where the Western Americana section was located.  That request would surely lead to a big change in what I had been reading before, since I had been stuck in the Sci-Fi section of the library.\n\nShe explained that the first 2 women's voices I had  heard were part of the answer to my curiosity.\n\nThey were absolutely real.  Two women walking by on the sidewalk,  in front of my home, discussing something in the pleasant night air while enjoying the moon and the street lights.\n\n\"So those women were actually outside?  I was worried it was a trick by Cholita!\", I remarked.\n\nLily said, \"And so you changed the presentation again! The next thing you knew, you were experiencing what it's like to be tricked by women's voices.  The entire house was surrounded by women speaking in voices you could barely hear.  There were dozens of them, coming from all around the outside of your home.\"\n\n\"Yes, but before I could figure out if that was Cholita, it switched to motorcycles!  They were zooming all around me.  The freeway is nearby, so I figured it was some wealthy lawyers playing motorcycle gang, until they left the freeway and began to speed up and down city streets.  And then I heard them far off in the distance, as if the entire city had been invaded by a gang.\"\n\nLily explained, \"You kept switching your interest.   Your internal dialogue was trying to reassert itself, to bring rationality back to the situation.\n\nWhat you had was not quite internal dialogue yet.  But close enough.  You have to remain impassive, if you want a smooth presentation of knowledge. Your attention must focus on a limited range, and hold it until you are done *knowing* that thing.\"\n\n\"But was any of it real?  The women, the motorcycles, the story teller?\"\n\nLily said, \"I'm going to answer about the story teller, so that you are clear on this.  Yes, he's very famous.    The inorganic beings even fear him a bit.\n\nHis tales of the Wuwonians in particular, are legendary.  And nearly countless, because he designs a new story based on each audience, but always about the topic of mirth and its relationship to luck and the spirit.\"\n\n\"As for the rest of it, you still only look at the story or the story teller.  Never between it all. You're always worried about the profit margin.  What gain is there for me?\n\nWhy do you care what part was real, and what part was not?  Didn't you enjoy it?  And if you did care what was real, and what was not, how could you even decide such a thing?  And what could you do about it?  Throw a tantrum and smash something if you didn't approve of it's realness?\n\nIf you worry about whether the path of sorcery is real or not real, you've already missed the whole lesson.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The WuWonians", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"v6lvhyw1o0n81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v6lvhyw1o0n81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9ed29f2661bf369db8067a053fc07be3ee9fc33"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v6lvhyw1o0n81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00e3fcf13eea980d3dc7a72e8951fcf2a4654bbc"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v6lvhyw1o0n81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0f467dd6fbd6469c50d0a94454978bb5eab739d"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v6lvhyw1o0n81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3064c832dff5ce6cb64b285e03283b0987c6dd77"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v6lvhyw1o0n81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b0e036d487cb4af64d1306c2c4e4f7cb6a26720"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v6lvhyw1o0n81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63059897e56c64ea23f30617c682abd20b06575e"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/v6lvhyw1o0n81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e89660f41b2a2c5e194466df23c5438df09b50a1"}, "id": "v6lvhyw1o0n81"}}, "name": "t3_tcd8bl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/XozIkmT6diRDoOTeKB80xqls9TypVAfkkgitrsJKsFI.jpg", "edited": 1647126641.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1647079130.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v6lvhyw1o0n81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e89660f41b2a2c5e194466df23c5438df09b50a1\"&gt; Not what I had expected, but I&amp;#39;m a big fan of \\&amp;quot;The Concrete\\&amp;quot; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was exploring Silent Knowledge again tonight.

It&amp;#39;s beyond your flaws and limitations as a being of just one realm.  You get to see what people do in all realms.  Human or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily continued.  The story teller is a famous magician from their world. His ability to produce tiny pieces of reality in the air, as vivid as the real world, is why he&amp;#39;s sought out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked Lily if I could have talked to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily responded, &amp;quot;This isn&amp;#39;t what &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;.  Just what &lt;strong&gt;could be&lt;/strong&gt;.  You can&amp;#39;t talk to the story teller for real.  If you could, what horrors could be unleashed!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s just for viewing, unless you want to change things up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had realized that point.  Silent Knowledge seems to be malleable as far as &amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot; goes.  it&amp;#39;s continuous knowledge, but how you receive it is somewhat your choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Exactly!&amp;quot;, Lily said.  She explained she&amp;#39;d been a little worried about me, because I seemed too dense to make a good scout.  She added, &amp;quot;Cholita makes an excellent scout. She doesn&amp;#39;t care about rationality at all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to be a scout!&amp;quot;, I complained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s your choice, but you&amp;#39;ve been living off the benefits of scouts for nearly your entire life.  You only got in to this sorcery business, because someone scouted ahead and told you stories of the road,  to motivate you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized Carlos had told us the same thing.  He said we should stop reading the books of Carlos Castaneda, because he only wrote those to hook us.  Now we were hooked.  And we had the real thing in front of us   So stop reading them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had an odd question for Lily.  So many other things had happened and I hadn&amp;#39;t figured out if they were real or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily went on, &amp;quot;Don Juan warned you about this, but you didn&amp;#39;t get it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked her,  &amp;quot;When?&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She explained, &amp;quot;You just read it yesterday.  Don Juan suggested that being a modern man, Carlos was a reader.  He had a choice to view scenes when in Silent Knowledge, as the Olmecs tended to do, but maybe he should consider viewing Silent Knowledge as text he can read.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I commented that I was way ahead of her, and had already realized that between don Juan telling him that, and now, with cellphones, we&amp;#39;re no longer &amp;quot;readers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;media consumers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought I had made a good point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily looked pained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You still didn&amp;#39;t get it.  You always look at either the story, or the story teller, and never in between.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers have to look through the cracks! That&amp;#39;s what turns ordinary people into sorcerers in the first place.  Noticing that people don&amp;#39;t have to live one way or the other because there&amp;#39;s some variety in that. So a sorcerer looks between those views to find what&amp;#39;s behind it all, hoping to escape to a better place.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She explained.  Don Juan&amp;#39;s suggestion was not about the details of his recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was about choice.  Don Juan was letting the readers of the books of Carlos Castaneda know, they had a choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge can never flow to us in it&amp;#39;s pure form. It&amp;#39;s just an interaction on the emanations.  A vibration of sorts.  Like a harmonic ringing on an infinite number of musical instrument strings, each tuned to a unique frequency. And yet the ringing is more pleasant to hear than any individual string.  It conveys information beyond the sound of each string.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we can never absorb that directly. So it has to be filtered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We select the method of receiving the information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Those women&amp;#39;s  voices!&amp;quot; I commented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She went on.  Yes, those voices.  You wondered where was the story teller&amp;#39;s voice coming from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You gazed off to look at him, again not realizing the absurdity of having the story still floating in the air to the right of you, and instantly knowing which direction had a &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; sitting in a comfy chair telling that story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you did exactly what don Juan was trying to tell us. You exercised choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your pocket of realty expanded, there was space beyond the story teller, outside your own home,  and you glanced off past him to try to understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You were assembling an entire world freely, piece by piece.  The same way Cholita expands her phantom copy of your home.  And all just to understand a single point!  Nothing you have ever seeing in the darkroom, is anywhere near that.  The interplay of the emanations themselves, became available to your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT&amp;#39;S silent knowledge.  It&amp;#39;s a way of understanding things which has no limits on what you are able to think.  It&amp;#39;s just at the level of knowing.  And without the words limiting things, you get scenes. Phantom worlds.  Temporary constructs of realness.  All designed just to help you understand something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And the voices?&amp;quot;, I asked her.  &amp;quot;Were they real&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily said that was the best part, but I didn&amp;#39;t even notice.  I had changed the presentation of Silent Knowledge!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By wondering about where the voice had come from, and was it real, I began to get silent knowledge on where voices come from, and whether they are real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very odd topic for sure, but there is still knowledge available on that one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;it was almost like asking a library clerk where the Western Americana section was located.  That request would surely lead to a big change in what I had been reading before, since I had been stuck in the Sci-Fi section of the library.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She explained that the first 2 women&amp;#39;s voices I had  heard were part of the answer to my curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were absolutely real.  Two women walking by on the sidewalk,  in front of my home, discussing something in the pleasant night air while enjoying the moon and the street lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So those women were actually outside?  I was worried it was a trick by Cholita!&amp;quot;, I remarked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily said, &amp;quot;And so you changed the presentation again! The next thing you knew, you were experiencing what it&amp;#39;s like to be tricked by women&amp;#39;s voices.  The entire house was surrounded by women speaking in voices you could barely hear.  There were dozens of them, coming from all around the outside of your home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, but before I could figure out if that was Cholita, it switched to motorcycles!  They were zooming all around me.  The freeway is nearby, so I figured it was some wealthy lawyers playing motorcycle gang, until they left the freeway and began to speed up and down city streets.  And then I heard them far off in the distance, as if the entire city had been invaded by a gang.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily explained, &amp;quot;You kept switching your interest.   Your internal dialogue was trying to reassert itself, to bring rationality back to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you had was not quite internal dialogue yet.  But close enough.  You have to remain impassive, if you want a smooth presentation of knowledge. Your attention must focus on a limited range, and hold it until you are done &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; that thing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But was any of it real?  The women, the motorcycles, the story teller?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to answer about the story teller, so that you are clear on this.  Yes, he&amp;#39;s very famous.    The inorganic beings even fear him a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His tales of the Wuwonians in particular, are legendary.  And nearly countless, because he designs a new story based on each audience, but always about the topic of mirth and its relationship to luck and the spirit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As for the rest of it, you still only look at the story or the story teller.  Never between it all. You&amp;#39;re always worried about the profit margin.  What gain is there for me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do you care what part was real, and what part was not?  Didn&amp;#39;t you enjoy it?  And if you did care what was real, and what was not, how could you even decide such a thing?  And what could you do about it?  Throw a tantrum and smash something if you didn&amp;#39;t approve of it&amp;#39;s realness?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you worry about whether the path of sorcery is real or not real, you&amp;#39;ve already missed the whole lesson.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e6deba4-a617-11ec-90b9-2a099f759379", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "tcd8bl", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 29, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/tcd8bl/the_wuwonians/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/tcd8bl/the_wuwonians/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1647079130.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i0d9ya4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1647093363.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_tcd8bl", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;decided to visit the blue people\n\nCoincidentally, I was reading this just yesterday:\n\n\"This is my dad's story, not mine: In the 80s, my dad was in the Peace Corps and lived in Sierra Leone for 3 years.

He had to have been standing on the toilet because I could see his whole face and the upper part of his shoulders. Immediately zipped up and got the f**k out of dodge.

On this J curve map:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even\\_better\\_j\\_curve\\_diagram/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even_better_j_curve_diagram/)\n\nAnd you'll be pushed highly off to the side of it, so that if you keep that up you damage yourself semi-permanently.  Won't ever be able to escape that down there, even if you give up the drugs and do what we suggest in here.\n\nAt least, so far no one has.\n\nSo you'll be ruined for exploring further than that into the orange station on this map, down at the bottom, and then eventually into the purple zone at the end, where you can often just ignore the laws of physics.\n\nThose little pictures are things I did while in this subreddit, and from years past. I just put them there to give an indication of what you can expect to see and do along that J curve map.\n\nIt's the route reality takes, if you learn to stop talking to yourself in your head, get a dark room to practice in, and do some old Olmec sorcery movements designed to shift your perception.\n\nYou do it completely awake, no drugs, for HOURS a night if you wish.\n\nSoon, it's like taking a walk each night in \"Miles Square Park\", a place near my home.  A HUGE park.\n\nIt becomes as real as that.\n\nNot only is there no damage to the body or mind doing it our way, but you have to remove personality defects others keep for life, to get over there.\n\nSo it actually makes you sane in the long run, and you realize the people around you are not.\n\nYou're really cheating yourself out of what you want, by using substances to do what you can do by yourself, fully awake, eyes open, absolutely sober.\n\nStuff that beats any guru, prophet, or \"saint\" out there.\n\nOur only motivation in here, is to create 10 who can do what I just said.\n\nThere's no money or religious motivations in here.\n\nNor even \"spiritual\" ones.\n\nIt's just 8000 year old Olmec technology we hope can be saved from disappearing from earth due to civilization \"advancing\" too far to support it.\n\nI suppose you could do that drug trip more, and \"share\" the results with others in a psychonaut subreddit, but how much fun is that?\n\nThey don't care.

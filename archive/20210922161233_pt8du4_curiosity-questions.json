I was actually there when these events took place, at 12 years old.\n\nIn the early 60s, there was growing interesting in hallucinogens.  Even Einstein was trying Owsley's jel tabs.  LSD was found in his brain at the autopsy.\n\nThere wasn't yet a stigma, because \"dirty hippies\" hadn't yet been invented.\n\nThe holy grail for an anthropologist was to study the use of power plants with a \"genuine Indian shaman\".\n\nCarlos first visited Morongo, but the sorceress there (Ruby) was already working with UC Riverside. Carlos was  UCLA.  She sent him elsewhere, and he found don Juan.\n\nDon Juan had knowledge of 10,000 year old Olmec sorcery, passed to the Toltecs, then passed to a Chinese pirate, a Bishop in the catholic church, and an assortment of down on their luck Mexican citizens.\n\nHe couldn't tell Carlos that.  Carlos would have run away.\n\nSo don Juan told him it was Yaqui, since don Juan was Yaqui, and lived at the end of the bus route where the Yaqui wars ended.\n\nCarlos wanted to learn about power plants, so that's what don Juan taught him.  From the Olmec Sorcerers of thousands of years ago.  And in particular, the \"Men of Knowledge\".\n\nWe aren't trying to be like them.  It's just a lesson in the \"olden days\" from don Juan, to keep Carlos around so he could be pushed into another state of consciousness, where the real learning took place.\n\nWe push you directly there, and skip the bedtime stories.  Using techniques Carlos left to us before he died.\n\nBut in lieu of the bedtime stories we have scary ones, so I think you come out ahead.  It takes us 1 year to learn what took Carlos 10 years.\n\nMost written in the early books is a thorn in the side of this community, because people believe they can learn to be a seer that way.   With drugs, or weird pretending about your behavior, void of real magic.\n\nIn fact, the Men of Knowledge never learned to *see* energy, so they had to rely on power plants and complicated rituals.  Our goal is ONLY to learn to see energy.\n\nThe \"early book sorcerers\" are a constant source of problems in this subreddit. They're drunk with desire for power they won't ever have.\n\nYour \"mundane\" life will become less and less attractive until you finally realize, everyone is living in a prison.\n\nCarlos called it \"the chicken coop\", emphasizing we're basically food for something else.\n\nIf you try to stick even a toe outside the chicken coop, the chickens inside begin to peck you on the head, to force you to come back.\n\nIt's true.  You'll see if if you practice.\n\nSo, \"mundane life\" sucks.  The further you go, the more you'll realize this. It's based on a series of unnatural false narratives.\n\nOur natural state was fine.

I was actually there when these events took place, at 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the early 60s, there was growing interesting in hallucinogens.  Even Einstein was trying Owsley&amp;#39;s jel tabs.  LSD was found in his brain at the autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;#39;t yet a stigma, because &amp;quot;dirty hippies&amp;quot; hadn&amp;#39;t yet been invented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The holy grail for an anthropologist was to study the use of power plants with a &amp;quot;genuine Indian shaman&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos first visited Morongo, but the sorceress there (Ruby) was already working with UC Riverside. Carlos was  UCLA.  She sent him elsewhere, and he found don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan had knowledge of 10,000 year old Olmec sorcery, passed to the Toltecs, then passed to a Chinese pirate, a Bishop in the catholic church, and an assortment of down on their luck Mexican citizens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He couldn&amp;#39;t tell Carlos that.  Carlos would have run away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don Juan told him it was Yaqui, since don Juan was Yaqui, and lived at the end of the bus route where the Yaqui wars ended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos wanted to learn about power plants, so that&amp;#39;s what don Juan taught him.  From the Olmec Sorcerers of thousands of years ago.  And in particular, the &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t trying to be like them.  It&amp;#39;s just a lesson in the &amp;quot;olden days&amp;quot; from don Juan, to keep Carlos around so he could be pushed into another state of consciousness, where the real learning took place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We push you directly there, and skip the bedtime stories.  Using techniques Carlos left to us before he died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in lieu of the bedtime stories we have scary ones, so I think you come out ahead.  It takes us 1 year to learn what took Carlos 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most written in the early books is a thorn in the side of this community, because people believe they can learn to be a seer that way.   With drugs, or weird pretending about your behavior, void of real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, the Men of Knowledge never learned to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; energy, so they had to rely on power plants and complicated rituals.  Our goal is ONLY to learn to see energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;early book sorcerers&amp;quot; are a constant source of problems in this subreddit. They&amp;#39;re drunk with desire for power they won&amp;#39;t ever have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your &amp;quot;mundane&amp;quot; life will become less and less attractive until you finally realize, everyone is living in a prison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos called it &amp;quot;the chicken coop&amp;quot;, emphasizing we&amp;#39;re basically food for something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you try to stick even a toe outside the chicken coop, the chickens inside begin to peck you on the head, to force you to come back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true.  You&amp;#39;ll see if if you practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, &amp;quot;mundane life&amp;quot; sucks.  The further you go, the more you&amp;#39;ll realize this. It&amp;#39;s based on a series of unnatural false narratives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our natural state was fine.

It&amp;#39;s larger than the bed!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later if you try both, stationary and moving around, you will visually see that it&amp;#39;s very good to stretch out, using tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the same as chair silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you have a bit of a hangover, a cold coming on, smoked too many cigarettes, or visited your favorite all you can eat buffet, and aren&amp;#39;t feeling very good, the fastest way to move the assemblage point to where you start to feel good again is by stretching out while doing tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to say you shouldn&amp;#39;t do it anyway, if you can&amp;#39;t move around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s very different results and experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little things are everything, in sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_pt8du4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pt8du4/curiosity_questions/hdup752/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1632323387.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hduka3t", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_pt8du4", "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "I am very new here (1-2 months??).

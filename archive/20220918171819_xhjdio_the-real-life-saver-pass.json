Sorry about the \"Granny bashing\", but it's facebook. It's rough out there!\n\n\\*\\*\\* facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nThe REAL lifesaver pass\n\nThat's our own Jadey, who was in private classes.  And that's precisely how I remember this pass too.\n\nWhich shows something odd.\n\nIf a Tensegrity pass looks like something else, from the ordinary world of exercise, people will end up doing the ordinary version.\n\nOr, mutating the correct version, to be more like the ordinary one.\n\nMeaning, no one understands Tensegrity at all!\n\nIt's not \"Howard Lee's Kung Fu\", stolen by Carlos!  Are you serious?  Howard is a Daoist.  I don't need to explain about Daoists again do I?  Can't you go do your own googling to learn the truth about asian \"magic\"?\n\nAnd it's absolutely not \"Chi Gung\".  There's NO MAGIC in chi gung.  None.  If you believe there is, show me on google!\n\nIt's just another Chinese attempt to steal from others.  There's plenty of those in China.  I have an office there.  Stealing through trickery does not have the same  moral implications as it does in the west.  It's assumed there, that your magic is all pretend.\n\nJust as we assume in the west, that there's actually no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or real dead people walking around on halloween.\n\nChi Gung is just a cultural phenomena there, mostly used for old people to hook up early in the morning, while their young ones have to get ready for work and can't see what grandma is actually up to in those street corner parks.    Hint: It's the old chinese man in sunglasses.  That's what she wants.\n\nThe old women are doing what young women do.  Trying to seduce the available men.  \"Chi Gung\" is just an excuse.\n\nHere we have \"Leisure World\" for old people.  And one of the main hazards at that delux retirement city, is alcoholism and sexually transmitted diseases.  Sorry, but it's the truth.  People are people.  Getting old doesn't change that.\n\nBut \"qigong\" has been \"marketed\" in the west by bad western men, who try to remove the truth of it and confuse gullible westerners, with a new type of \"magic franchise\" they can sell.\n\nTensegrity is NOT a kungfu copy, or chi gung gone bad.\n\nIt's movements the old seers did deep in dreaming, that they really liked.\n\nSuch as you made up as a child, to allow you to fly in dreams.  Or to allow you to jump from very high trees.\n\nTensegrity is \"Dream games\".  Which move the assemblage point.\n\nCarlos put it into martial arts because he wanted to preserve it as a \"system\". Before that, it was just a series of random techniques that did cool things.\n\nTechniques we can do, to gain a link back to the intent of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico.\n\nThat's the main thing we seek. That LINK.  That pull towards the only magic we have access to.\n\nDO NOT ALTER IT!\n\nIf you do, the amazing \"dark\" magic of the old seers will be lost from it.\n\nI tried this pass again last night, so I could write about it today. I didn't know Jadey had finished her video, but I suppose something out there did.  And so I specifically tried it, so I could describe in detail what the pass does, when you can reach Silent Knowledge.\n\nThe striking of the soft part of the shoulder creates a dazzling spark of light.  Spark isn't the right description.  It's closer to an explosion.  But it's \"thick\" like those flickering geometric objects you can see materialize for an instant, in darkness. Maybe 1 inch in diameter, if it were round. But certainly, the soft part of the shoulder can't contain it. It's a bit larger than that.\n\nThe shock waves of the brilliant flashes generated by tapping the shoulders, radiate out into the darkness and illuminate the inside of the egg. Of our luminous container.\n\nThat makes the crusted energy out there more visible. The stuff we redeploy to make the \"energy body\".\n\nBut the spinning motion of the arms, causes it to swirl! And the gaze of your eyes going around and around like that, gives the forming energy ball a purpose. To seek out things!\n\nIt's like getting a room full of puppies too excited, so that they all start to leap and bark.  In that state, if you could make the sound of a kitten off in the distance they'd all charge that direction.\n\nBeing loose from the walls, the purple/blue light, which is intense, begins to condense into a more definable ball.\n\nBut unlike the normal energy body we build with Tensegrity, by stuffing those puffs onto the pouches, this energy body has NO INFLUENCE from our tonal rationality.  It didn't get stuck onto those pouches, where our \"reason\" and \"rationality\" is stored. It didn't absorb any doubts or limitations.\n\nIt's a diffuse, irrational version of your energy body.\n\nSo what does a \"diffuse, irrational energy body\" do?  Every piece of your energy body is sentient all by itself, and can show you a dream vision.  You could have 4 of them in the air in front of you, put there by your hands, and each one can show you a different dreaming scene, like a TV monitor.\n\nThat's part of why \"Silent Knowledge\" is so awesome.\n\nSo what does a \"diffuse, irrational energy body\" do?\n\nIt materializes a phantom realm all around you.\n\nIn my case, the inorganic being's world.  Because that has \"real energy\", and when the phantom realm starts to form from the diffuse energy body, it gets \"sucked\" onto that real world.  Of the inorganic beings.\n\nWhich can be used as a springboard to travel anywhere.\n\nBut what about the health benefits of the twisting motion?\n\nIsn't that the lifesaver part?\n\nOf course!   But how disappointing if a sorcerer like Carlos couldn't make a joke at our expense.\n\nImply the one thing, but then the other is unavoidable if you follow his instructions.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The REAL Life Saver Pass", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"h7wd30s4wmo91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 53, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h7wd30s4wmo91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38b6f8eaf1b42b289064d48d4a7a80eb6a097df2"}, {"y": 106, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h7wd30s4wmo91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09d51070aeb5e5fe537b926124805fe8cce2c24a"}, {"y": 157, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h7wd30s4wmo91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26c77f57a0f3940c67dce17605ec00010fc472ae"}, {"y": 315, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h7wd30s4wmo91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=106deb0c5fc79f3ece0b0df22cee9f0b6dc03594"}], "s": {"y": 370, "x": 751, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/h7wd30s4wmo91.png?width=751&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5119740cd07a5d3d7ccfcbe26df694c909b96e36"}, "id": "h7wd30s4wmo91"}}, "name": "t3_xhjdio", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 28, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lK1Q0jy5dz4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Life Saver Pass\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 356, "scrolling": false, "height": 200}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "Life Saver Pass", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lK1Q0jy5dz4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Life Saver Pass\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "version": "1.0", "author_name": "Sorcery Passes", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lK1Q0jy5dz4/hqdefault.jpg", "type": "video", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIXfGUhYdiUlijwLwgLSz0Q"}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lK1Q0jy5dz4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Life Saver Pass\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 356, "scrolling": false, "media_domain_url": "https://www.redditmedia.com/mediaembed/xhjdio", "height": 200}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 28, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jnoN68Az-U2522_pXiwWjDMCZM1LbrNDStVbU8bG3d8.jpg", "edited": 1663514821.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1663514299.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h7wd30s4wmo91.png?width=751&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5119740cd07a5d3d7ccfcbe26df694c909b96e36\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/h7wd30s4wmo91.png?width=751&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5119740cd07a5d3d7ccfcbe26df694c909b96e36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK1Q0jy5dz4\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK1Q0jy5dz4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From facebook.

Then \"B\" happens when it's in the middle of the back, and so on.\n\nAs I said before, we'd need a very skilled seer of the assemblage point, to figure that out.  I'm hoping Carlos left us last minute descriptions of that type of detail, and I simply haven't read it.\n\nHowever, as you play with colors more, you'll develop the feeling that you're in a continuum.\n\nMeaning, a progression of fun experiences, getting more and more bizarre and magical the further in you go.\n\nAnd the continuum has depth.  Which is why Carlos showed us that J curve.\n\nTo give us a way to understand it.\n\nVarious fun things that you've experienced are more likely to occur at specific depths.  Having that J curve in mind lets you try to associate them with a specific place.\n\nInorganic beings for example are most visible at a specific depth.  I'm going to make a guess based on one of those \"secret messages\" Carlos left for me, with Cholita.\n\nThey're most visible when the assemblage point just passes the liver.  When it's below that.  Of course the liver is on the right, if the assemblage point is on the left, so we're only talking about, if you drew a line with a magic marker on your stomach, just below the bottom of the liver, that's a sweet spot for IOBs.\n\nBut if you go more than 6 inches down from there, it's too far.\n\nIf someone doesn't have an IOB to help them (a \"spirit helper\") they can still play with the colors, do tensegrity once they become visible, and get the assemblage point to move far enough that you can go \"IOB hunting\".  Move it to that spot.\n\nBut how do you know it's at that spot?\n\nFor IOB hunting, you need the puffs of color to be everywhere. In fact, it should sort of be like a jungle of bushes with soft puffs of leaves.  You can walk through that bush jungle, but as you do little puffs of leaves are in your way, and your face brushes against them.\n\nThat's where you can find IOBs.\n\nYou walk around in that jungle and gaze into each puff of leaves that nearly smacks you on the cheek.\n\nWhen you find a face, you watch it until it goes away.\n\nThen search for another.\n\nAt some point you'll realize it's the same face you keep seeing, and it's jumping from one puff to the next.  When you catch the jump, meaning you see it on one puff, then without losing it for any duration it's on the next puff, that is when you use Tensegrity to extract it.\n\nThen do what Juan is doing.  Play with it.\n\nI hope Juan isn't implying, he took advantage of Fairy in dreaming, after being so nice to her!\n\nOk. I admit it.  She doesn't care.   \n\nInorganic girls are \"easy\".\n\nIs it really an IOB?\n\nWell.   It's a being isn't it?\n\nYou can see it right there.\n\nDoes it have an organic body?\n\nNope.\n\nSo it's an \"inorganic being\".\n\nIt's not an intercepted dream, because it isn't inside a little world of it's own. And intercepted dreams animate at full speed.  You're hypnogogic head will not.\n\nIt's not an actual person, like Cholita's solid dreaming body.\n\nThose animate at full speed, and as they walk around they generate pieces of whatever dream they are experiencing.\n\nIf Cholita comes in my room in her dreaming body, and walks across and puts her hand down to touch something (in her dream), that object becomes visible to me.\n\nA dreaming body which believes itself to be in a dream, and doesn't notice you, will generate details on the ground with each step it takes.  I suppose, whereever their attention looks  is lit up enough for you to intercept.\n\nIn that state, you're intercepting intent.  And even a footstep by a dreaming double places intend on the ground there.\n\nBut is there any outside energy inside that new IOB you found in Bush Jungle?\n\nEven if there isn't, there will be!\n\nA \"real\" IOB will notice you playing with it, and do what they can do in lucid dreaming.\n\nIf you find a \"scout\" in lucid dreaming, and get familiar with its behavior, you'll realize it can take over any of the phantoms, at any time.\n\nIt can even switch while you are watching a phantom!\n\nOr, it can switch to another just as you're about to kick it's inorganic butt.\n\nHere's an experiment for the skilled lucid dreamers.\n\nLocate a scout by dissolving phantoms until you find one that isn't empty.  But don't burn them up entirely if you notice they have something inside.\n\nYou have to watch as you make them go away, so that you can stop before it's completely transformer.\n\nDon't worry. It takes somewhere near 10 seconds to force them to dissolve.

Then &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; happens when it&amp;#39;s in the middle of the back, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I said before, we&amp;#39;d need a very skilled seer of the assemblage point, to figure that out.  I&amp;#39;m hoping Carlos left us last minute descriptions of that type of detail, and I simply haven&amp;#39;t read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, as you play with colors more, you&amp;#39;ll develop the feeling that you&amp;#39;re in a continuum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, a progression of fun experiences, getting more and more bizarre and magical the further in you go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the continuum has depth.  Which is why Carlos showed us that J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To give us a way to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Various fun things that you&amp;#39;ve experienced are more likely to occur at specific depths.  Having that J curve in mind lets you try to associate them with a specific place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inorganic beings for example are most visible at a specific depth.  I&amp;#39;m going to make a guess based on one of those &amp;quot;secret messages&amp;quot; Carlos left for me, with Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re most visible when the assemblage point just passes the liver.  When it&amp;#39;s below that.  Of course the liver is on the right, if the assemblage point is on the left, so we&amp;#39;re only talking about, if you drew a line with a magic marker on your stomach, just below the bottom of the liver, that&amp;#39;s a sweet spot for IOBs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you go more than 6 inches down from there, it&amp;#39;s too far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone doesn&amp;#39;t have an IOB to help them (a &amp;quot;spirit helper&amp;quot;) they can still play with the colors, do tensegrity once they become visible, and get the assemblage point to move far enough that you can go &amp;quot;IOB hunting&amp;quot;.  Move it to that spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how do you know it&amp;#39;s at that spot?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For IOB hunting, you need the puffs of color to be everywhere. In fact, it should sort of be like a jungle of bushes with soft puffs of leaves.  You can walk through that bush jungle, but as you do little puffs of leaves are in your way, and your face brushes against them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where you can find IOBs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You walk around in that jungle and gaze into each puff of leaves that nearly smacks you on the cheek.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you find a face, you watch it until it goes away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then search for another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point you&amp;#39;ll realize it&amp;#39;s the same face you keep seeing, and it&amp;#39;s jumping from one puff to the next.  When you catch the jump, meaning you see it on one puff, then without losing it for any duration it&amp;#39;s on the next puff, that is when you use Tensegrity to extract it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then do what Juan is doing.  Play with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope Juan isn&amp;#39;t implying, he took advantage of Fairy in dreaming, after being so nice to her!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok. I admit it.  She doesn&amp;#39;t care.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inorganic girls are &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it really an IOB?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well.   It&amp;#39;s a being isn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see it right there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does it have an organic body?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s an &amp;quot;inorganic being&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not an intercepted dream, because it isn&amp;#39;t inside a little world of it&amp;#39;s own. And intercepted dreams animate at full speed.  You&amp;#39;re hypnogogic head will not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not an actual person, like Cholita&amp;#39;s solid dreaming body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those animate at full speed, and as they walk around they generate pieces of whatever dream they are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Cholita comes in my room in her dreaming body, and walks across and puts her hand down to touch something (in her dream), that object becomes visible to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A dreaming body which believes itself to be in a dream, and doesn&amp;#39;t notice you, will generate details on the ground with each step it takes.  I suppose, whereever their attention looks  is lit up enough for you to intercept.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that state, you&amp;#39;re intercepting intent.  And even a footstep by a dreaming double places intend on the ground there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But is there any outside energy inside that new IOB you found in Bush Jungle?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if there isn&amp;#39;t, there will be!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; IOB will notice you playing with it, and do what they can do in lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you find a &amp;quot;scout&amp;quot; in lucid dreaming, and get familiar with its behavior, you&amp;#39;ll realize it can take over any of the phantoms, at any time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can even switch while you are watching a phantom!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, it can switch to another just as you&amp;#39;re about to kick it&amp;#39;s inorganic butt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an experiment for the skilled lucid dreamers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Locate a scout by dissolving phantoms until you find one that isn&amp;#39;t empty.  But don&amp;#39;t burn them up entirely if you notice they have something inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to watch as you make them go away, so that you can stop before it&amp;#39;s completely transformer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry. It takes somewhere near 10 seconds to force them to dissolve.  If you you only dissolve them to, let&amp;#39;s say,  9 seconds, they&amp;#39;ll recover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing your &amp;quot;scout&amp;quot; is there, and maybe still slowed down a bit, turn around and find a herd of obvious phantoms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pick one out you know absolutely cannot be a scout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go talk to him.

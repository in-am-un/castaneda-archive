I have a page of raw notes, typed at 3AM.\n\nI've been doing Zuleica's silence technique during the day, and discovered that \"searching for Power\" has some odd side effects.\n\nYou actually gain more power. I'm not sure why, but I expected that to be a silly exaggeration. That there's such a thing as, \"Power\".\n\nNow before you get out your eagle feathers and medicine bag, pick out a new Indian sounding name for yourself like \"Bill DesertTurtle\", saying \"We KNEW it!\", here are the notes I took last night.\n\nI took them after I discovered there's a ski lodge under my bed. Two days in a row now.\n\nI might enter that dream, but they aren't wearing their COVID masks. Shame on them!\n\nSo take the notes with a grain of salt.\n\nAnd while taking them I often had to set the cellphone down and try something again, because it was so nutty I couldn't believe it myself.\n\nDream tensegrity:  \nScoop dream to stomach and watch floor. Dream plays on floor.  \nConvert iob to dream. Just ask them. They can play out a scene for you too.  \nSend iob to find dream. Full size best, walking around room.  \nTease dream in air. The ickiest intent.  \nPurpose is to immerse in dreams till double is fully present with you.  \nDo tensegrity moves to enhance dreams.  \nUse gait of power version with hands pull up to create disturbance which can produce dream.  \nGaze is actually unbending focus of awareness, like zuleicas silence daytime gazing.  \nRedeploy dream itself, back to front.\n\nDon't ask me what \"ickiest intent\" is. Probably automatic spelling correction.\n\nAnd, that's only 1/4th of what I was able to do. I stopped writing it down, because it was too much.\n\nBut in fact, manipulation of dreams, as if they were merely puffs of energy, is possible when you reach the position of \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nZuleica's daytime technique re-trains your relationship to the world. By walking around looking at every single detail you can see, while forcing your internal dialogue to be external and silent, you return to a state closer to a child.\n\nChildren don't move around like Zombies the way adults do, unless beaten down by another. Normally, you can tell exactly what a 4 year old is going to do next, by watching their eyes and facial expression. You can see where they are about to pounce next.\n\nThey're born to hunt \"power\".\n\nBut as that internal dialogue slowly takes over and drowns out their pure awareness, replacing it with worry and scenario planning, they become more like adults.\n\nZuleica's silence technique restores your normal relationship to the world. And it spills over into dark room gazing power.\n\nUsing the new power, and the different type of silence you learn with it, your gaze becomes more \"steady\".\n\nThe \"No Boredom\" policy of Juan might actually be, \"always focus awareness\".\n\nI'm not sure yet, since you have to focus your awareness on magic in the darkroom. There's nothing else to see there, it's pitch black.\n\nWhereas you can focus on many things in day light. So in darkness, it's hard to focus continuously the way you can in sunlight.\n\nBut it likely works anyway, because you learn not to go inside yourself for longer periods.\n\nIt's that pesky \"be here now\" thing.\n\nI kind of expected a dreaming double to look like myself, but so far it's difficult to \"see yourself\".\n\nI just get a yellow blurry body.\n\nOr a limb that looks normal, which might be stranger than the yellow blur, due to the room being fully dark.\n\nWhen I find an \"extra arm\", it's as if it were lit by the normal room light.

Some people can't manage dark room time.\n\nUnfortunately I'm not a good test. I'm already able to shut off my internal dialogue.  But I don't see why that path wouldn't work just as well.\n\nIt damaged my darkroom gazing (which I'm doing equally as much as before), but then it boosted it enormously.\n\nIt's much easier to get the dreaming double to come out.\n\nLast night I invented a new darkroom game, but I'll have to try it out a bunch, before it's worth drawing up.\n\n\"Fishing for Dreams\".  You literally look down into a pool of swirling yellow, black, and purple, and use your fingers to find dreams swimming around like fish.\n\nThat's from outdoor gazing.\n\nActually it's mostly a trick, because it causes the jet black to come out, and if you get lucky, the yellow.  You do that by looking far up to the right, with arm outstretched, while other arm is pointing down at the ground, for balance.  You lean high up, for example to the right, and stir the air with your fingers.  If you lean high enough, meaning more than you usually do, and breathe deeply, it brings out the yellow.\n\nBut it'll do that even for people who can't get silent.  If you breath deep while leaning way back or looking up, you \"see stars\".\n\nPeople in here have mentioned that sort of effect, which I attribute to \"pandiculating\".\n\nHoward Lee was using that trick in his \"Light of Life\" workshops.\n\nThe yellow is so intense, it shifts the assemblage point enough for the jet black to come in and eat it up.\n\nThe Jet black makes the yin yang symbol \"whorl\" that spits off text, but can also make what looks like a flow of smoke or water.\n\nOnce the jet black swirls with yellow, anything can happen.  The arm up high, for example on the right, and the arm down low to the left, causes the water to flow to the floor. And you use your gaze too.  Or use your hands to scoop it down if it's stubborn.\n\nThen you bend over and let your hands dangle, looking for \"fish\".  Fingers almost down to the floor.\n\nOf course, it's 100% trick.  You guys can probably figure out why the dangling down low is also part of the trick.\n\nFinding dreaming is trivial once you see that stuff.  \n\nFinding dreaming fish swimming in yellow waters on your floor isn't much more difficult.\n\nNot sure what to do with a fish shaped dream, once you pull it out of the water.  Certainly you could hold it in your hand and blow into it.\n\nMaybe I could get Fancy to be a Siberian cat, like Fairy did, and she could eat the fish.\n\nI should mention, anything you can actually do and perceive using dreams, even if it's as absurd as a ski lodge under your bed, or a flopping \"dream fish\" is an excellent thing to practice.  It brings out the dreaming double.\n\nI seem to recall Genaro in a fuzzy animal suit swooping around trees for Carlos, showing him, \"the nagual\".\n\nThat was even weirder than fishing in the dark room.\n\nOnce you can switch to that swirling colors thing, all sorts of fun stuff is available.  It's not the swirls, it's what position of the assemblage point you have to be at, to see those.\n\nThe coolest thing that allows, is entering any dream you see. Or world you assemble on the walls.\n\nWithout it, we're prevented from breaking the laws of physics (as far as I know).  \n\nUnless you have a nice IOB to help you enter.\n\nThe dreaming double is also an IOB I suppose.", "edited": 1608134628.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gg1gif1", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve gone outdoor gazing because I was asked to do that.

If you breath deep while leaning way back or looking up, you &amp;quot;see stars&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People in here have mentioned that sort of effect, which I attribute to &amp;quot;pandiculating&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Howard Lee was using that trick in his &amp;quot;Light of Life&amp;quot; workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The yellow is so intense, it shifts the assemblage point enough for the jet black to come in and eat it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jet black makes the yin yang symbol &amp;quot;whorl&amp;quot; that spits off text, but can also make what looks like a flow of smoke or water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the jet black swirls with yellow, anything can happen.  The arm up high, for example on the right, and the arm down low to the left, causes the water to flow to the floor. And you use your gaze too.  Or use your hands to scoop it down if it&amp;#39;s stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you bend over and let your hands dangle, looking for &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot;.  Fingers almost down to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, it&amp;#39;s 100% trick.  You guys can probably figure out why the dangling down low is also part of the trick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finding dreaming is trivial once you see that stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finding dreaming fish swimming in yellow waters on your floor isn&amp;#39;t much more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure what to do with a fish shaped dream, once you pull it out of the water.  Certainly you could hold it in your hand and blow into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I could get Fancy to be a Siberian cat, like Fairy did, and she could eat the fish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should mention, anything you can actually do and perceive using dreams, even if it&amp;#39;s as absurd as a ski lodge under your bed, or a flopping &amp;quot;dream fish&amp;quot; is an excellent thing to practice.  It brings out the dreaming double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I seem to recall Genaro in a fuzzy animal suit swooping around trees for Carlos, showing him, &amp;quot;the nagual&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was even weirder than fishing in the dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you can switch to that swirling colors thing, all sorts of fun stuff is available.  It&amp;#39;s not the swirls, it&amp;#39;s what position of the assemblage point you have to be at, to see those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The coolest thing that allows, is entering any dream you see. Or world you assemble on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without it, we&amp;#39;re prevented from breaking the laws of physics (as far as I know).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you have a nice IOB to help you enter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dreaming double is also an IOB I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_kdsew2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/kdsew2/not_what_i_wanted_to_post_today/gg1gif1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1608133940.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gg0900p", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "monkeyguy999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1608099119.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_kdsew2", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_14w1ssx0", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Im glad understanding the wonder of focusing on everything.

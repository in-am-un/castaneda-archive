Maybe that was for women?\n\nSo you'll look down and see that glow while doing tensegrity movements such as \"mashing energy\".\n\nI see yellowish and white for my \"tonal\"'s awareness.\n\nThe \"puffs\" which are commonly seen as purple, is the awareness we have, which refused to take part in our perpetual \"pity party\".\n\nIt fled to as far away from us as it could get.\n\nBut no more than 5 feet away from the torso.\n\nJust scoopy one up, and gently place it on one of those 3 areas.  The green on the right, the red on the left, and on the top that's actually two, where you see the yellow.\n\nIt will \"linger\" at first.  But not in a satisfying fashion!\n\nYou have to get over the idea that the \"second attention\" is as reliable as t he first attention.\n\nYou'll see something!  It's not imaginary.\n\nBut it'll be like smoke with colored lights shining into it, and a mild breeze moving it slowly away from where you placed it.\n\nIf you see crystals inside, that's just because that puff is your \"double\".\n\nYou're dreaming body.\n\nIt's sentient!\n\nAs you gaze into it, it decides to \"amuse\" you with crystalline details, dream bubbles, scenes of alien planets.\n\nLater you'll be able to rub that on your eyes, and borrow the super power of your dreamer.\n\nImagine if you had the kind of power you have in dreams on a very good night, to just make whatever you like appear or go away.\n\nYou get to do that awake!\n\nNow why on earth would anyone obsess over sleeping dreaming???\n\nSo whatever you see when you \"stuff\" the puff on those 3 areas (one area per puff), don't sweat it.  Don't worry if it's \"right\".\n\nAs long as you see something, \"intent\" itself will help you see it better each time.\n\nUntil a day will come that you only have to hold a puff in your hand, like it was a small pillow, and bring it \"close\" to one of those pouches.\n\nAnd the pouch itself will suck it over.\n\nDoes it stay?\n\nIt has a variety of activities.  Best you just see what it does.\n\nBut it can literally form an \"Iron Man\" suit complete with head's up displays all around you.\n\nRemote views in any direction.\n\nAlso never forget.\n\nIt's cold outside the river of shit.\n\nIt is NOT cozy.\n\nSo all the sights of darkroom, feel empty and \"invalid\".\n\nYou have to \"redream\" yourself to accept those as willingly as you accept what you were born into.\n\nThe iron man suit is VERY worth seeing!", "edited": 1677192617.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j9qvwa0", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuff anything you can find!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even stuffed an inorganic being last night, after asking her if it was all right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, your torso has 3 pouches made of around 8 internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus there seems to be one down lower they didn&amp;#39;t emphasize.

Maybe that was for women?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;ll look down and see that glow while doing tensegrity movements such as &amp;quot;mashing energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see yellowish and white for my &amp;quot;tonal&amp;quot;&amp;#39;s awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot; which are commonly seen as purple, is the awareness we have, which refused to take part in our perpetual &amp;quot;pity party&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It fled to as far away from us as it could get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no more than 5 feet away from the torso.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just scoopy one up, and gently place it on one of those 3 areas.  The green on the right, the red on the left, and on the top that&amp;#39;s actually two, where you see the yellow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will &amp;quot;linger&amp;quot; at first.  But not in a satisfying fashion!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to get over the idea that the &amp;quot;second attention&amp;quot; is as reliable as t he first attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll see something!  It&amp;#39;s not imaginary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;ll be like smoke with colored lights shining into it, and a mild breeze moving it slowly away from where you placed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you see crystals inside, that&amp;#39;s just because that puff is your &amp;quot;double&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re dreaming body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s sentient!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you gaze into it, it decides to &amp;quot;amuse&amp;quot; you with crystalline details, dream bubbles, scenes of alien planets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later you&amp;#39;ll be able to rub that on your eyes, and borrow the super power of your dreamer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you had the kind of power you have in dreams on a very good night, to just make whatever you like appear or go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get to do that awake!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now why on earth would anyone obsess over sleeping dreaming???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So whatever you see when you &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; the puff on those 3 areas (one area per puff), don&amp;#39;t sweat it.  Don&amp;#39;t worry if it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as you see something, &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; itself will help you see it better each time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until a day will come that you only have to hold a puff in your hand, like it was a small pillow, and bring it &amp;quot;close&amp;quot; to one of those pouches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the pouch itself will suck it over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does it stay?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has a variety of activities.  Best you just see what it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it can literally form an &amp;quot;Iron Man&amp;quot; suit complete with head&amp;#39;s up displays all around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remote views in any direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also never forget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s cold outside the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is NOT cozy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So all the sights of darkroom, feel empty and &amp;quot;invalid&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to &amp;quot;redream&amp;quot; yourself to accept those as willingly as you accept what you were born into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The iron man suit is VERY worth seeing!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11a9k43/how_to_staff_puffs/j9qvwa0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1677191684.0, "media_metadata": {"xqobzcpk22ka1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 96, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xqobzcpk22ka1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe1ac0dbdcd58c83e4552de66eb0fdd677cb6d39"}, {"y": 192, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xqobzcpk22ka1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=522b22c28dc27a5c034d5053b8a5d722f321f54d"}, {"y": 284, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xqobzcpk22ka1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73c2d0f858792bc1ba600c530b564ce95884a3cb"}, {"y": 569, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xqobzcpk22ka1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63ec39eade8b9e7c03ca72d11aeaf8aa7879f4c9"}], "s": {"y": 579, "x": 651, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xqobzcpk22ka1.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d438e86bb4af8d0c5fa77a14ed16853487c7a2ec"}, "id": "xqobzcpk22ka1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_11a9k43", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 12}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j9t1lss", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j9ry1vp", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It is because you never stop using the tools of the blue line, so you can't get a glimpse of what is out there to explore.\n\nBut there is no way to explain that.

We assume everything is a piece on the table, so we can explore it with our rationality.\n\nTake the piece with our hands, and describe it. Add it to our inventory. Our \"list of pieces\".\n\nWich we come back to check it several times in the day, and do slight modifications based on our new perspectives.\n\nIt is how we make the world solid!\n\nBut there is other stuff outside the table.

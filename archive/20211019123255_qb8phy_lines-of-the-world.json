From the books:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"No. Not-doing is only for very strong warriors, and you don't have the power to deal with it yet. Now you will only trap horrendous things with your hand. So do it little by little, until your hand doesn't get cold any more. Whenever your hand remains warm you can actually feel the **lines of the world** with it.\"\\*\\*\\*\n\nCobwebs, I like to call those.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"Let's say that you can feel them. The most difficult part about the warrior's way is to realize that the world is a feeling. When one is not-doing, one is feeling the world, and one feels the world through its lines.\"\n\nHe paused and examined me with curiosity. He raised his brows and opened his eyes and then blinked. The effect was like the eyes of a bird blinking. Almost immediately I felt a sensation of discomfort and queasiness. It was actually as if something was applying pressure to my stomach.\n\n\"See what I mean?\" don Juan asked and moved his eyes away.\n\nI mentioned that I felt nauseated and he replied in a matter-of-fact tone that he knew it, and that he was trying to make me feel the **lines of the world** with his eyes.\n\nI could not accept the claim that he himself was making me feel that way. I voiced my doubts. I could hardly conceive the idea that he was causing my feeling of nausea since he had not in any physical way impinged on me.\n\n\"Not-doing is very simple but very difficult,\" he said. \"It is not a matter of understanding it, but rather of mastering it. Seeing, of course, is the final accomplishment of a man of knowledge, and seeing is attained only when one has 'stopped the world' through the technique of not-doing.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThat last one probably isn't quite accurate.  I stopped the world  using silence. So did Carlos at UCLA cafeteria.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"I haven't noticed anything of the sort,\" I protested in a loud voice.\n\nDon Juan said that my body had noticed our pursuer in spite of my stubborn opposition, and he assured me in a confident tone that there was nothing unusual about being followed by a shadow.\n\n\"It is just a power,\" he said. \"These mountains are filled with them. It is just like one of those entities that scared you the other night.\"\n\nI wanted to know if I could actually perceive it myself. He asserted that in the daytime I could only feel its presence.\n\nI wanted an explanation of why he called it a shadow when obviously it was not like the shadow of a boulder. He replied that both had the same lines, therefore both were shadows.\n\nHe pointed to a long boulder standing directly in front of us.\n\n\"Look at the shadow of that boulder,\" he said. \"The shadow is the boulder, and yet it isn't. To observe the boulder in order to know what the boulder is, is doing, but to observe its shadow is not-doing.\n\n\"Shadows are like doors; the doors of not-doing. A man of knowledge, for example, can tell the innermost feelings of men by watching their shadows.\"\n\n\"Is there movement in them?\" I asked.\n\n\"You may say that there is movement in them, or you may say that the **lines of the world** are shown in them, or you may say that feelings come from them.\"\n\n\"But how could feelings come out of shadows, don Juan?\"\n\n\"To believe that shadows are just shadows is doing,\" he explained. \"That belief is somehow stupid. Think about it this way: There is so much more to everything in the world that obviously there must be more to shadows too. After all, what makes them shadows is merely our doing.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo we can see, it's more complicated than ley lines.   Ley lines may indeed exist, and there's some argument for it in the books. But in this case, don  Juan is talking about noticing one thing is the same as the other, based on the lines it contains.  And that obviously takes seeing.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI moved my eyes away, and I saw a coyote calmly trotting across the field. The coyote was around the spot where I thought I had seen the man. It moved about fifty yards in a southerly direction, and then it stopped, turned, and began walking towards me.\n\nI yelled a couple of times to scare it away, but it kept on coming. I had a moment of apprehension. I thought that it might be rabid, and I even considered gathering some rocks to defend myself in case of an attack.\n\nWhen the animal was ten to fifteen feet away I noticed that it was not agitated in any way; on the contrary, it seemed calm and unafraid. It slowed down its gait, coming to a halt barely four or five feet from me. We looked at each other, and then the coyote came even closer.\n\nIts brown eyes were friendly and clear. I sat down on the rocks and the coyote stood almost touching me. I was dumbfounded. I had never seen a wild coyote that close, and the only thing that occurred to me at that moment was to talk to it.\n\nI began as one would talk to a friendly dog. And then I thought that the coyote 'talked' back to me. I had the absolute certainty that it had said something. I felt confused, but I did not have time to ponder upon my feelings, because the coyote talked again.\n\nIt was not that the animal was voicing words the way I am accustomed to hearing words being voiced by human beings. It was rather a feeling that it was talking, but it was not like a feeling that one has when a pet seems to communicate with its master either.\n\nThe coyote actually said something. It relayed a thought and that communication came out in something quite similar to a sentence. I had said, \"How are you, little coyote?\"\n\nI thought I had heard the animal respond, \"I'm all right, and you?\" Then the coyote repeated the sentence and I jumped to my feet.\n\nThe animal did not make a single movement. It was not even startled by my sudden jump. Its eyes were still friendly and clear. It lay down on its stomach and tilted its head and asked, \"Why are you afraid?\"\n\nI sat down facing it, and I carried on the weirdest conversation I had ever had. Finally it asked me what I was doing there, and I said I had come there to stop the world.\n\nThe coyote said, \"Que bueno!\" and then I realized that it was a bilingual coyote. The nouns and verbs of its sentences were in English, but the conjunctions and exclamations were in Spanish. The thought crossed my mind that I was in the presence of a Chicano coyote. I began to laugh at the absurdity of it all, and I laughed so hard that I became almost hysterical.\n\nThen the full weight of the impossibility of what was happening struck me and my mind wobbled. The coyote stood up and our eyes met. I stared fixedly into them. I felt they were pulling me and suddenly the animal became iridescent. It began to glow.\n\nIt was as if my mind were replaying the memory of another event that had taken place ten years before when under the influence of peyote I witnessed the metamorphosis of an ordinary dog into an unforgettable iridescent being. It was as though the coyote had triggered the recollection, and the memory of that previous event was summoned and became superimposed on the coyote's shape. The coyote was a fluid, liquid, luminous being. Its luminosity was dazzling.\n\nI wanted to cover my eyes with my hands to protect them, but I could not move. The luminous being touched me in some undefined part of myself, and my body experienced such an exquisite indescribable warmth and well-being that it was as if the touch had made me explode. I became transfixed. I could not feel my feet, or my legs, or any part of my body; yet something was sustaining me erect.\n\nI have no idea how long I stayed in that position. In the meantime, the luminous coyote and the hilltop where I stood melted away. I had no thoughts or feelings. Everything had been turned off, and I was floating freely.\n\nSuddenly I felt that my body had been struck, and then it became enveloped by something that kindled me. I became aware then that the sun was shining on me. I could vaguely distinguish a distant range of mountains towards the west.\n\nThe sun was almost over the horizon. I was looking directly into it and then I saw the '**lines of the world**'. I actually perceived the most extraordinary profusion of fluorescent white lines which crisscrossed everything around me.\n\nFor a moment I thought that I was perhaps experiencing sunlight as it was being refracted by my eyelashes. I blinked and looked again. The lines were constant, and were superimposed on, or were coming through everything in the surroundings. I turned around and examined an extraordinarily new world. The lines were visible and steady even if I looked away from the sun.\n\nI stayed on the hilltop in a state of ecstasy for what appeared to be an endless time, yet the whole event may have lasted only a few minutes, perhaps only as long as the sun shone before it reached the horizon, but to me it seemed an endless time.\n\nI felt something warm and soothing oozing out of the world and out of my own body. I knew I had discovered a secret. It was so simple. I experienced an unknown flood of feelings. Never in my life had I had such a divine euphoria, such peace, such an encompassing grasp, and yet I could not put the discovered secret into words, or even into thoughts- but my body knew it.\n\nThen I either fell asleep, or I fainted. When I again became aware of myself, I was lying on the rocks. I stood up. The world was as I had always seen it. It was getting dark, and I automatically started on my way back to my car.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI guess I'll stop there.  That's all just basic dark room happenings.", "edited": 1634661335.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hh904x7", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might as well completely solve this if possible.

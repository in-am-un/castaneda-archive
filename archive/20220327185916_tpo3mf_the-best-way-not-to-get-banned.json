Or \"politely\" beat up by hopeless Dzogchen groupies.\n\nBut it's better than having to chant with them while some bad player guy in an \"Enlightened Master\" robe lords it over everyone.\n\nAlways keep in mind, even though you currently have doubts.\n\nYou can do this!  This picture.  True, most of the time you're lucky to get a pale woman's face just barely visible on a pathetic puff of pink light.\n\nBut as you will learn much later, there's \"reasons\" for that.\n\nAnd it's not what you believe.\n\nOver in the invite only subreddit I give a theory or two for that. But it's too advanced for this subreddit.\n\nI reached Silent Knowledge last night, and focused on the double.\n\nOn learning what he's really up to, in the darkroom.\n\nIt was like visiting the parents of a new romantic obsession.\n\nYour new lover sits at the table a little lower, playing with a spoon, while their parents eagerly tell you about the naked baby picture they have of  them,  on the Tiger Skin rug.\n\nNo one likes their \"beans\" spilled.\n\nBut at one point my double decided to just become an \"accessory\" to Silent Knowledge, and it was the first time I realized he's been doing that since the beginning.\n\nIt happened while I was backing off from \"full on\" silent knowledge, to something less overwhelming.\n\nI noticed I was having such an easy time last night, because there were at least 3 inorganic beings visible, if I looked around.\n\nGrateful, I told the one in the middle that I was sorry I told them to go away, last week.  I wanted to reach SK all by myself, like a spoiled 8 year old.\n\nI was a tiny bit disappointed in how the IOB I was facing looked.  Just a pink cloud, and her dim face in the middle.\n\nBut I figured, we just don't know why the IOBs are sometimes AMAZING, such as why my entity Fancy wears a red riding hood costume for me, and becomes 100% real and semi-solid.\n\nAnd cuddles up against me.  Such that I actually feel her body pressing against me.\n\nWhile she teaches me amazing magic.\n\nMaybe it's what La Gorda was saying, about how as you \"advance\" the IOBs stop being scary and real, and just turn into a \"pressure\".\n\nDoesn't seem like an \"advance\" to me!\n\nBut at least I  had them around, and the one in the middle was listening to me attentively.\n\nSuddenly I saw a very large cloud of purple puffs flow into her, from the right side.\n\nI recognized it.  It was my own double, in \"puff body\" form.\n\nHe wasn't exactly a \"copy\" of me.  Not technically \"the double\".\n\nBut he was certainly a form of \"energy body\".\n\nAnd he flew right into my pathetic looking IOB.\n\nShe instantly bloomed into a truly amazing sight.  Perfect face, perfect makeup, perfect hair, and dressed well enough to go out to dinner anywhere in LA.  I've never been dressed that well in my life!\n\nI've seen Cholita with $1000 worth of clothes on, but it still didn't match this inorganic being.\n\nI gasped.\n\n\"So it was YOU all the time????\", I asked my double.\n\nBut he'd already answered that question.\n\nMaybe...

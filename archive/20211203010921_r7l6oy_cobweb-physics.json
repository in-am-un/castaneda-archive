It's wonderful, but extremely hard to remember.\n\nSome of it gets too abstract to recall.  And your IOB can even taunt you about that.  They might show you something so cool you want to run to the computer to write it down, and then point out, \"You won't remember this...\"\n\nNot even all the way to the computer!\n\nYou could even get into an actual back and forth argument with them over there.   Where the whitish light surrounds you.\n\nThat's \"seeing\" territory.\n\nAnd the IOBs possibly just cheat and tie into our natural abilities, taking credit for them until you figure out their trick.\n\nBut you're never going to be completely sure that's what's going on.\n\nIt's like someone serving prepared food from Nowhere, Cholita's favorite market in LA.  And not telling the people they serve it to, that they didn't actually cook that.\n\nCan you complain?\n\nI suppose not.  But it seems like if they were honest they might have...\n\nHonest IOBs?\n\nProbably not.\n\nLike Cholita, they take any free advantage they can.  And they're both so magical, you can't complain much.\n\nWhat you see here is what I remembered, but not what motivated  me to post this.\n\nThat stuff is all gone from my memory.\n\nAll I know is, you don't need me to discover that.  You'll find it on your own. And it's all good, so here you are.\n\nThe other stuff is like, \"Oh my god, you mean you can use them to do that???\"\n\nYep.\n\nAnd \"But you can't seriously mean...\"\n\nYes.\n\nOr, \"How about that crack in reality over there, and the filament headed in there...\"\n\nGo for it. See for yourself.\n\nMeaning, you may enter when you like...\n\nBut that's all I have left of it. What I put in the picture here.\n\nCobwebs were a more common topic in what I now know were women's classes I never heard about at the time.\n\nMaybe the very ones Cholita attended.\n\nBut I did notice that when Carlos brought cobwebs up in my classes, it was while talking to a woman I didn't recognize.\n\nHe \"let it slip\" by adding a new sentence to what he'd talked to her about before.\n\nOne of the other women would ask him to clarify, and that's how we'd get to hear it.\n\nThose women didn't realize he was doing that on purpose, and thought he simply didn't remember we hadn't been discussing that in this class.\n\nThey assumed, the old geezer is losing his memory...\n\nReally?  That's like a Jaguar forgetting how to bite.\n\nThen one day, Carlos gave us the same task he'd given one of the women.\n\nTake off all of your clothes, and lie naked in the path of ants.\n\nOf course the women in my particular class, who didn't get into the others much, whispered, \"He just wanted Bunny naked.\"\n\nI made up the name,  since I have no idea of the real identity of the girl Carlos wanted naked.\n\nBut I could only hope it was \"Bunny\".\n\nAnd... Yea, maybe.  Carlos was said to be more like Julian than don  Juan.\n\nBut he also had Grant naked, and I really doubt he had plans like one might think, for Grant. Grant was the red headed, slightly overweight, young AV man.  If there was a sound check, Grant was likely lurking around somewhere.  Along with the highly desirable \"Canadian brothers\".\n\nAs for women and sex in sorcery groups, I've learned a bunch from Cholita.\n\nWomen never believe men aren't interested in sex, and so they themselves become suspicious and constantly on the lookout for any men around them, to indicate they have evil designs on their body.\n\nCholita's a classic.  While paranoid I'm after her body, she dresses in just black panty hose, covered over in a \"witch outfit\" that looks quite expensive and frilly, with lots of silver jewelry.\n\nIf you just look at her, it looks very LAish.\n\nYes, witch like.  But not uncommon in LA, and certainly tasteful.\n\nBut then up on a bar stool, where her \"witch coat\" no longer covers her lower part,  you realize, SHE'S NAKED!!!\n\nAt least, from the point of view of an old guy like me.\n\nI still haven't caught up from when they redefined panty hose, to be \"leggings\".\n\nIt was  a pleasant development, but I always suspected it was just China trying to save on material without anyone realizing it.\n\nAnd so with Cholita, if you notice that in fact she's not wearing much in public, and you try to verify if those are in fact her red panties clearly visible there, she's caught you!\n\nJust as she assumed. That's what you're really after!\n\nIt makes female sorcery companions difficult. Trust me, I don't exaggerate.  They mostly all do that.\n\nFrankly, it means you need to settle that issue up front if you can.\n\nI have no doubt don Juan and party took care of that right away, or they'd have people who felt they were \"still on the outside waiting to see if it's worth their effort\".\n\nThat's women.\n\nThe men are worse, but not regarding sex.\n\nSo Carlos gave out his \"get the woman naked\" plans to everyone, telling us to lie naked under crawling ants, so we could learn what the cobwebs in the air feel like.\n\nAnd, I always did what Carlos asked.\n\nWithin days of his request, I found I had a little trail of Argentinian ants in my bathroom.\n\nVery unusual.  I couldn't remember having seen them in that room before, and being in my home was also very rare.\n\nBut there they were.  In the most convenient place to carry out his orders, so I did.\n\nIt didn't really seem to accomplish much.\n\nBut then, 15 years later, after Carlos had died, I was walking in China.\n\nMy feat had been sweating profusely from the very humid, very hot air of the South East Pacific.\n\nAnd I'd been walking for weeks, all over.\n\nI developed a common Asian foot fungus.\n\nThe pharmacist laughed as he talked about my plight in Mandarin.  My \"helper\" added, in English, \"Don't give him a discount.  He's got too much money anyway.\"\n\nSo he didn't.\n\nAs a bonus he advised me to try to go barefoot as much as possible, so my feet remained dry while the medicine took effect.\n\nI did as he suggested.  At one point I found myself standing on a busy street in Beijing, watching what looked like 10,000 people stream out of a subway exit.  They were coming up from down below the street.\n\nI casually walked over, curious if the subway was really down there, or it was some kind of street underpass.\n\nAs I got closer to the top of the exit, I felt ants crawling on my ankles.\n\nI jumped a little.  But, the ants were very gentle. So my worry went away as I glanced down.\n\nThere were no ants.\n\nI couldn't understand it so I reached my hand down, putting the back of my hand nearly onto the concrete walkway.  I could feel the ants on my palm.\n\nI lifted my cupped hand up like I was holding a pile of ants.  But there was nothing in it.\n\nSo I poured it over my head, remembering a tensegrity pass that had a strange scooping and pouring movement.\n\nThe ticklish sensation of ants spilled over my hand, running down my head.\n\nIt felt like \"ant water\".\n\nCarlos had offered us a \"task\".\n\nIf he offered a task, the crazier the better. And if you took him up on it, you had just put in your bid with intent.\n\nAs he liked to call it, \"You jumped!\"\n\nAnd though it took 15 years, intent paid off.\n\nSo find some ants, and take off your clothes.\n\nUnless your name is \"Bunny\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cobweb Physics", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"i2zka2qqz7381": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i2zka2qqz7381.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af1f8e70802e86b75019d9be22f61e1b161495d9"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i2zka2qqz7381.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c55c40ca3165ef568bc4f8680bfec83b59584aa5"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i2zka2qqz7381.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d8f4a4382fee2cb79552c0221a894c5a0ad937e"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i2zka2qqz7381.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b416f1d6b075504f9bbbed3d0ade0a863f0764bb"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i2zka2qqz7381.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=810103117d72e9477cc35b167dd42aa047590222"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i2zka2qqz7381.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c01ca10031e3422710b08bcd1c9164a8be3f2e2"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/i2zka2qqz7381.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=852ce81648ae9aa8e68d69ca0bd72d97670fd3f1"}, "id": "i2zka2qqz7381"}}, "name": "t3_r7l6oy", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/TvvPRZRFPllORCMpcrwNBbhS8Ux5snHOpZO4k06G0f4.jpg", "edited": 1638492899.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1638490161.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i2zka2qqz7381.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=852ce81648ae9aa8e68d69ca0bd72d97670fd3f1\"&gt;And Old Topic which deserves reminding: look for these!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darned deep orange zone!

So I used the telescope trick, kind of surprised it was working so well.  Lily helped, there's no other explanation.\n\nDoing what you're doing is just the telescope trick.  Same one I use to remove view Cholita.\n\nIt can connect anywhere in reality.  It's not related to the IOB realm, except that you can use it there.\n\nWhen you use it in the IOB realm, they notice and can alter what you see.\n\nSo in that realm, it's different than just looking around in random locations.\n\nBy the way, one method to sustain heightened awareness is to find the whitish light, and wake up the next day still seeing it, when you close your eyes.\n\nIt's like going up into a tree house to be with shadow beings, so you can keep your assemblage point stable at the end of the J curve.\n\nYou see the whitish light each time you close your eyes.\n\nAnd if you sit calmly and gaze through it, you can do the telescope thing.\n\nEven see people walking around a corner, before they emerge.\n\nSee how much energy a being has (how far up from their toes it's risen).\n\n\\&gt;Wich one do you think is the one that don Juan' lineage had to do\n\nEveryone had an elder to move him where needed, so I presume it went as it did in the books of Carlos.\n\nWe can't go that path, we don't have any \"elders\" to push us where we need to go.\n\nI'd say the best way for us to get dark energy is to find ourselves an inorganic being who will be visible during practice.  Then when you're doing something difficult, find them and keep them near.\n\nIt's like one of those refueling military planes. The bigger plane doesn't have to stop to refuel, the smaller one just flies to it's side and loads it up with dark energy.\n\nIf you have a shortage even with your IOB floating nearby, reach out your hand, scoop her into it, and then push and pull on her face with your hand, while you blow at her.  Tell her you love her too.\n\nBe patient.  She usually doesn't react right away.\n\nI suppose it could be that while doing that, you yourself are charging up with dark energy.\n\nAnd when she finally reacts to what you are doing, it's actually because you got enough dark energy to move your assemblage point to a more favorable position.\n\nLily told me something related to this, but the way it occurred was too random to trust my interpretation.\n\nBut she said, there's a sweet spot for viewing IOBs, and it's not HA.  It's back of that.\n\nHowever, the IOBs can appear in dreaming as fully real, and in HA the dreaming double comes out.  You can even be 80% dreaming double, and not realize it.\n\nSo, it's almost meaningless to talk about where IOBs are most vivid.\n\nAnd, if you want to give them more energy, horizontal shifts of the assemblage point is what they like.\n\nUncharted territory.", "edited": 1625843943.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h4lke07", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably have to translocate to their realm to know that.

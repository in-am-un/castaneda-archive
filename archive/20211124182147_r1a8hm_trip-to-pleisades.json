You can't edit those and spell check doesn't seem to go up there as you type. Maybe I should have called it, \"M45\"?\n\nIt's also \"The Seven Sisters\", or for some native Americans, \"The 6 lazy boys\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's visible in moonlight low on the horizon at times, so every culture has noticed it.\n\nGod even ribs Job over not being able to see it, the way God can.\n\nMan. What a small universe the Bible refers to!  And Buddhism too.  They seem unaware of the vastness of reality.\n\nLily taught me this technique.  It was part of her promise to teach me \"How to leave the darkroom\".\n\nMeaning, with the doors still locked.\n\nOf the techniques she taught me, this one turned out to be the most reliable.  The others still \"need something\" from me, if I want to repeat what Lily helped me to do.\n\nIf you're thinking, \"What the hell???\"\n\nDon't.\n\nThis is so obviously what Carlos wanted us to try, that I feel foolish for not realizing it.\n\nThe rule says you need a worthy opponent.  Carlos gave us the fliers.  How else can you get more than 2000 people, a worthy opponent?\n\nCholita couldn't even handle that many!\n\nAlthough she might like trying.\n\nBut the way Carlos gave us the fliers, was \"ludicrous\".\n\nNo one believed it at the time!\n\nBut as workshops \"featured\" our mortal enemy over and over, the community as a whole seems to have turned it into religion.\n\nAnd the fliers are the \"demons\".\n\nAll religions need their demons.\n\nMeanwhile, Carlos kept sticking bizarre tensegrity passes in his workshops, such as \"Stellar Hatch\".  Or \"Gift to Maui\".\n\nBoth obviously designed for space travel.\n\nThen there was the lovable Nagual Elias, who made sculptures based on his actual travels across the ENTIRE universe.\n\nThat means, you can even leave our Galaxy, for another.\n\nI'm not sure why that seems more impressive, than leaping hundreds of millions of light years in less than a minute.\n\nBut in fact, I always have wanted to see how the universe looks where it's creating new space on the edges.\n\nIt's like a giant puff, filled with crystalline dreaming images!  Us and our world.\n\nI suppose, the GRAND PRIZE of darkroom gazing, would be to hold the universe in your hand, like a puff.\n\nDo that, and maybe you deserve a short vacation.\n\nThere must be more Carlos info about space I don't know, because Nyei has taken up the space travel gauntlet.\n\nIf you can, support Nyei's efforts.  She's got stuff we need. I'd like to see her become a green zone shamanic drumming guide.  That would go well with this type of waking dreaming, where some find it hard to get to the green line on their own.\n\nSo Carlos **did indeed taunt us** to go visit the fliers home world.\n\nCan you do this?\n\nHere's the absolute truth.\n\nFor those of you who ask, \"But if I get rid of my internal dialogue, nothing will be left for me to think with!\"\n\nThat's so wrong, the experienced in here don't even know where to begin.\n\nOne \"advanced\" bad player who visited for a while, bragging up his outside knowledge and expecting respect, got so impatient at the idea that his \"work\" wasn't useful here, his head began to explode at the idea of internal silence. Had to be tossed out.\n\nOvernight!  I got out of watching it explode that time. In the morning, he was simply elsewhere pestering people about his pretend skills.\n\nDon't be like that!\n\nAll Silent Knowledge is, is when you really do get rid of that internal dialogue.\n\nThat's all it is!!!\n\nBut you don't get rid of it all at once.  You get rid of it, a little magic happens, and you think, \"Finally!\"\n\nThen you notice, the magic you got doesn't compare well to what's in the books. It's a start.  But...\n\nSo you begin to be a little more honest with  yourself.\n\nYou admit, maybe you weren't silent the ENTIRE 2 minutes.\n\nMaybe you were nicely silent, but every minute a word got through.\n\nCan that really matter?\n\nYES.\n\nSo you try harder, get more magic, then realize it's still not matching the extremes of the J curve map Carlos gave us.\n\nAnd you keep it up.  But something odd happens. Silence begins to be very enjoyable! It's no longer a burden. It's now a place floating in and out of extreme bliss.\n\nEventually the drive to remove ALL of your internal dialogue gets very weird.\n\nCarlos ended up flipping eggs on the highway leading to Tucson.\n\nFortunately, you can avoid the need to \"*know*\" eggs.  Leave that for the Zen guys who flip burgers to reach \"enlightenment\".\n\nIn the darkroom, the dialogue itself becomes stuff. Things.  Sensations.  Sounds.\n\nYou've reached the starting line!\n\nFrom there you get more and more silent, and even nuttier stuff happens.\n\nAbstract stuff!  Stuff you can't even explain.\n\nThen ultimately, you finally succeed in getting rid of that internal dialogue.\n\nAnd you realize, that's all silent knowledge ever was!\n\nYour natural state of being, before you got infected with language and worry.\n\nAstral Travelers:   Cut it out.  That's a false narrative.   It's like a job for which you never get paid, because the work you're doing isn't of  use to anyone.\n\nAnd yet, you keep hoping for a payday until you get too tired to find a job elsewhere and go on welfare.\n\nYou stick around because the food truck guys come out ahead, and so they keep encouraging you to continue on your \"job\", promising you'll see plenty of rewards.\n\nBut all you get is crummy burritos and mystery meat burgers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Trip to Pleisades???", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"3038oq6xsk181": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3038oq6xsk181.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c107915cc635998ce34d698a31aacc93f69fa247"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3038oq6xsk181.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=648a14fc9c338cf98760fd649dd380bc7cc1d864"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3038oq6xsk181.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c53b6eef1a5f604ff0feba27430d653ffc491455"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3038oq6xsk181.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e0261a02c65b3b8410f45686f40d6ea57708e27"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3038oq6xsk181.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fe2cbc271fee7b9445055d4cab447b5ecd99e2b"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3038oq6xsk181.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a3dcececaf8024705fa3e9518629a89705aeceb"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3038oq6xsk181.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db9eace23075de40543851c10c83592b5c5dc019"}, "id": "3038oq6xsk181"}}, "name": "t3_r1a8hm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/vQKL7kq2waev85pG2E7C021cZUXlKa7UdrqdTfumUmE.jpg", "edited": 1637795896.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1637774507.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3038oq6xsk181.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=db9eace23075de40543851c10c83592b5c5dc019\"&gt;Turns out, this isn&amp;#39;t even difficult!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the misspelling in the title.

How can you not look?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t go book deal and look for it, before you can see energy on a horizon (deep orange zone).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I just warned about shows the difference between men of knowledge, and the seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The men of knowledge were like spies, trying to pick up new techniques from the seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they overheard about sky gazing, they&amp;#39;d write it down and take off.  A new technique is what they were after.  Not seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like exploiting science for personal gain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not agains that though.  That&amp;#39;s what high tech people do, exploit science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the realm of sorcery, doing that means you don&amp;#39;t become a new seer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You become a ritual chaser.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, here&amp;#39;s another weird thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sky gazing would go very well with shamanic drumming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of which are Nyei specialities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it would work like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You use shamanic drumming in a cave, to get people to be able to see a translocated scene on the ground.  A shared dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you coax them to be able to do that above them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To see the night sky on the inside of a perfectly dark cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the trick here is, the scene on the ground, the shared remote view, is caused by the leader and one assistant.  They make those emanations easier to perceive for the audience, who&amp;#39;s assemblage points are moved to the green line by the drumming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they switch to sky gazing, the leader and his assistant don&amp;#39;t help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result is that the participants do the sky gazing part, only using their own knowledge of the &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot; of looking at the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yea, old man of knowledge behavior to be sure,  cash in by doing peyote ceremonies for tourists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except bing a drug free one, seems like greedy to earn money doing that.  You&amp;#39;d actually be passing on real magic to new people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_r1a8hm", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false,

The data is scattered randomly on the steps of the library.\n\nIf you look past that whitish light at the distance you are familiar for, for gazing at stars,  youre activating the doing of star gazing, and they begin to stand out in the whitish light.\n\nYou can enhance this by loading \"Star Chart\" onto your phone, so that in the darkness, you can turn on your phone and gaze up in that ap, and see the stars in their current location.  You gaze arond, maybe find Pleiades, and now you are trained a bit more.  When you return to darkness, the sky abovce you will almost give you goosebumps (almost).\n\nYou'll \"feel\" the doing of star gazing, and since you are seeing energy at that position of the assemblage point, you'll get translocated star charts!\n\nCrummy ones to be sure.  But there they are, above you in the darkroom, and pretty dark real looking.\n\nLike chunks of the night sky, behaving as if you were simply lookinig into a translocated scene of a forest, or a desert, on your walls.\n\nExcept looking up, invokes that intent.\n\nSo if humans ccan do stuff like that, which I never heard Carlos mention, perhaps it's a matter of reaching HA, and then relearning the world.\n\nAnd there's so much to relearn, no one could mention them all in 15 or so books.  \n\nAnd possibly, since Carol Tiggs and the witches are so different in lectures, if Carlos were gone andd they were doing the teaching, it might deviate so much from what Carlos created for us, that they would keep it to themselves.\n\nRemember that not all lineages behave like this one.  And the remnants of ours has the death defier.\n\nSo for example, Nyei would get Carol Tiggs instruction, and who knows that that would look like.  Maybe like Nyei's star sound workshop picture, with stars constantly visible above you?\n\nBut they perhaps would not add what they had learned since Carlos left, to what he created before he left.\n\nSo we would not be aware of it.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hm0cmx8", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a very strange theory!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Humans know the &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot; of looking up in darkness and seeing the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s essenetially orbs floating in darkness with a touch of deep blue, and  whitish haze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now don&amp;#39;t anyone do this if you aren&amp;#39;t in the orange zone, and so silent yhou&amp;#39;re already seeing translocatoins all arond the room.

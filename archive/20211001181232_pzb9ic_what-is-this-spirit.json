Too lazy to do any actual sustained work, they have nothing else to talk about. But they still have some interest. So they misrepresent something to get attention.\n\nNaturally, anyone can find some nightmares and twist them around to get attention.  And that's pretty much MOST of what we had these last 23 years since Carlos died.\n\n2 Something that happened once is not worth thinking about.  Sorcery requires HOURS a day, of unbelievable magic,  for years, just to reach intermediate status.    And the best policy is to ignore any one time visions, because if you focus on them too much, you use up the energy you needed to convince yourself to actually do some work to learn.\n\n3 Camera proof of something needs to be shown clearly or else it's not worth bringing up.  \n\nA video camera no one can investigate is not a free pass to make up stuff.\n\n4 There's no third eye.\n\nI suppose you could argue that we have 6 of them total, two tonal, two double, and two energy body, all of which can be present in the same room at the same time, and you can directly experience that  yourself.\n\nIn fact, that's the purpose of this subreddit.  For you to have 6 eyes.  Not 3.\n\nBut 6 eyes is not the same as mentioning that cheesy Hindu concept, which has been misused to sell stuff and confuse followers.  It's like the \"chakras\".  Designed for profit.\n\nNow, there **is** a \"floating third eye\". Those literally exist.\n\nBut they're too creepy to want to see such a thing. I've had to chase one away at least 3 times.\n\nJuann will get his own soon, and then we can see if he wants to keep it.\n\nLa Gorda, a troublesome witch in our lineage, liked hers.

Try staring into the darkness as a substitute, for at least an hour a night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take 1 ibuprofen before you do that, and maybe 2 pseudo fed (the real kind).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to summarize the problems in your post quickly, without referring to you too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because possibly they weren&amp;#39;t as obvious to you, as to anyone in here reading this who&amp;#39;s been around a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following are universal barriers to learning magic.   The reasons we have none on this planet at this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any resemblance to your comments is purely coincidental. Or to put that in a more interesting fashion and also imply something I&amp;#39;m not really sure about, you got around &amp;quot;bundles&amp;quot; of energy that aren&amp;#39;t useful for sorcery and your own energy copied some.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if you have a mental virus?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose unwanted skimmings of emanations are a little like a virus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1  A huge problem in the Castaneda community is people using dreams to justify pretend magical knowledge.  Too lazy to do any actual sustained work, they have nothing else to talk about. But they still have some interest. So they misrepresent something to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, anyone can find some nightmares and twist them around to get attention.  And that&amp;#39;s pretty much MOST of what we had these last 23 years since Carlos died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 Something that happened once is not worth thinking about.  Sorcery requires HOURS a day, of unbelievable magic,  for years, just to reach intermediate status.    And the best policy is to ignore any one time visions, because if you focus on them too much, you use up the energy you needed to convince yourself to actually do some work to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 Camera proof of something needs to be shown clearly or else it&amp;#39;s not worth bringing up.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A video camera no one can investigate is not a free pass to make up stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 There&amp;#39;s no third eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could argue that we have 6 of them total, two tonal, two double, and two energy body, all of which can be present in the same room at the same time, and you can directly experience that  yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, that&amp;#39;s the purpose of this subreddit.  For you to have 6 eyes.  Not 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But 6 eyes is not the same as mentioning that cheesy Hindu concept, which has been misused to sell stuff and confuse followers.  It&amp;#39;s like the &amp;quot;chakras&amp;quot;.  Designed for profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, there &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a &amp;quot;floating third eye&amp;quot;. Those literally exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;re too creepy to want to see such a thing. I&amp;#39;ve had to chase one away at least 3 times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juann will get his own soon, and then we can see if he wants to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;La Gorda, a troublesome witch in our lineage, liked hers.  Implied it was huge, maybe like the size of a pizza, floating right there a few feet away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real magic will come if you try!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pzb9ic/what_is_this_spirit/hezt46n/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1633107207.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_pzb9ic", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}]

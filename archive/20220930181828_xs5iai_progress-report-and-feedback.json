It's just an ordinary dream, some of which are vivid, scary, inspiring, and many of which are based on your daily obsessions and so will easily have \"sorcery themes\".\n\nBut they are not sorcery.  The proof of that is our very community, where over the last 50 years not a single person claiming to be using dreaming to learn, ever did.\n\nWomen aside.  But they also didn't get anywhere near what's in the books of Carlos and the witches, because no one else was taking is seriously.\n\nThis is rather simple to understand, once you can see energy.\n\nI was playing with it last night, to try to understand how it works.\n\nThe tonal energy is a different color than the energy body energy.  I doubt there's fixed colors for those, but I seem to see the same as Carlos.\n\nSo when tonal awareness mixes into the energy body, you can visibly see it.\n\nAt any rate, if the tonal energy comes out of the pouches it's visible.\n\nAnd a certain percentage has to mix with the double, before it's useful for sorcery.\n\nThat can happen asleep, where you find your hands.  Gazing at them, and then at objects, injects even more tonal awareness into the mix.\n\nBut at first, TOO MUCH, and you wake up.\n\nOr you can start out awake, where you use silence to go directly into dreaming without falling asleep. In that case, you bring ooodles of Tonal awareness with you.\n\nBut either way nothing you can do in the double, even in the most amazing dream worlds possible, can change our situation.  \n\nHe runs around infinity 24 hours a day!\n\nIt's the tonal that needs to be convinced to let go of it's prison.\n\nSo you MUST find your hands, or don't advertise your dreaming abilities.  It only harms the community by encouraging pretending.\n\nWe even have a cleargreen associate interviewing fake dreaming people on Youtube, as if he's helping the community and not just trying to steal attention from it.\n\nStep 1, find your hands.\n\nStep 2, learn to hold the dream more than a few seconds. There's advice out there on that, and I wrote a great deal of it back in private classes.  Jump up, shout, grab dirt, spin around, never give up even if you wake up.  Don't move and try to visualize the last thing, so you can go back in.\n\nStep 3, learn to identify which phantoms are scouts, and which are not.  Use the finger dissolving trick, where you point your finger at a phantom and STARE hard at any details on him.\n\nIt's a phantom construct, and if you focus on a shirt button it will start to mutate.\n\nCan't help itself.\n\nBut THERE'S where you need that tonal awareness. So when the round shirt button becomes square, you notice it.  The double might easily not.\n\nThat stare sets up a \"feedback loop\", and if you keep going the entire phantom will mutate and wither into junk on the ground.\n\nA REAL scout will not.  It will reveal a \"surprise inside\".\n\nSomething that actually has its own energy, so it will be a glowing object.\n\nIdeally here, you just make friends and ask it to take you to its world. \n\nThat's step 2. To learn from the dreaming emissary in its own world, so you can pick up dark energy.\n\nBUT, here's where the trouble can start.\n\nYou still didn't \"wrestle\" them.  And I'm not even sure that wrestling one in your daily world, is a guarantee they'll behave in the dreaming world.\n\nFancy goes into dreams with me, and she doesn't exactly attack.\n\nBut she's happy to be very persistent and annoying.   Or to lure me into a private place of her own.\n\nShe pulled me into a hospital last night, where I got lost looking for \"Room 115\".\n\nWasn't an ordinary dream, because I never went to sleep to get there.\n\nAnd in 4 gates dreaming, it's common to find that the phantoms are now after you.\n\nAs soon as you can become aware of your dreaming, you're the guy they were looking for.  And don't care what plans you had.\n\nThey want to pin you to the ground, and lay on top of you.\n\nOr otherwise \"trap you\".  Such as with metal tubes, machine gears, dead end passages that become blocked on the side you entered from.\n\nWhy can't they trap you with naked Elf women in a hot tub?\n\nWhy not trapped in a cartoon style middle eastern Harim?\n\nEven the Simpsons' living room might be amusing.\n\nBut no... It's always unpleasant.\n\nYou'll need to escape from them or your dream will end.  You'll either be forced to wake up to escape extremely unpleasant feelings, or being trapped will cause you to run out of dreaming energy all by itself.\n\nWe need the dream scenes to change.  We can't stay in just one for too long, or we wake up.\n\nZooming is the answer to both problems.  A need for constant dream changes, and a need to escape the phantoms.\n\nYou find a distant high point, such as the top of a mountain or the top of a building.\n\nGaze FIERCELY at it, never flinching.  When the sight changes slightly, lean in towards it and eventually it will suck you over at tremendous speed.\n\nIf you can do that a few times I can give you tips on how to control it better.  You can \"steer\", slow down, or even land before you reach your destination.\n\nEvery successful \"zoom\" buys you a few more minutes.\n\nEventually hours.\n\nI'm not sure what that person who posted \"zooming\" was describing, but probably not this type. What I read sounded more like  \"Peeking\" to me.\n\nThere's all kinds of weird stuff that happens with sorcery, and \"zoom\" is a word that will get used in different situations.\n\nWhich points out another problem with trying to help people learn real sorcery.\n\nAside from all the lucid dreaming pretending.\n\nWords that have an established meaning in sorcery get recycled for something entirely different, so that it's all dissipated and confusing to beginners.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iqr1z5y", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First you MUST find your hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or else don&amp;#39;t bother other people about it.

Or to lure me into a private place of her own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She pulled me into a hospital last night, where I got lost looking for &amp;quot;Room 115&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;#39;t an ordinary dream, because I never went to sleep to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in 4 gates dreaming, it&amp;#39;s common to find that the phantoms are now after you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as you can become aware of your dreaming, you&amp;#39;re the guy they were looking for.  And don&amp;#39;t care what plans you had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They want to pin you to the ground, and lay on top of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or otherwise &amp;quot;trap you&amp;quot;.  Such as with metal tubes, machine gears, dead end passages that become blocked on the side you entered from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t they trap you with naked Elf women in a hot tub?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why not trapped in a cartoon style middle eastern Harim?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the Simpsons&amp;#39; living room might be amusing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no... It&amp;#39;s always unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll need to escape from them or your dream will end.  You&amp;#39;ll either be forced to wake up to escape extremely unpleasant feelings, or being trapped will cause you to run out of dreaming energy all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need the dream scenes to change.  We can&amp;#39;t stay in just one for too long, or we wake up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zooming is the answer to both problems.  A need for constant dream changes, and a need to escape the phantoms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You find a distant high point, such as the top of a mountain or the top of a building.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gaze FIERCELY at it, never flinching.  When the sight changes slightly, lean in towards it and eventually it will suck you over at tremendous speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can do that a few times I can give you tips on how to control it better.  You can &amp;quot;steer&amp;quot;, slow down, or even land before you reach your destination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every successful &amp;quot;zoom&amp;quot; buys you a few more minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what that person who posted &amp;quot;zooming&amp;quot; was describing, but probably not this type. What I read sounded more like  &amp;quot;Peeking&amp;quot; to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s all kinds of weird stuff that happens with sorcery, and &amp;quot;zoom&amp;quot; is a word that will get used in different situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which points out another problem with trying to help people learn real sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from all the lucid dreaming pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Words that have an established meaning in sorcery get recycled for something entirely different, so that it&amp;#39;s all dissipated and confusing to beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_xs5iai", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/xs5iai/progress_report_and_feedback/iqr1z5y/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1664719728.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1664719728.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iqocj7z", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "demonwillori", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1664661525.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iqioby2", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_kisuhbp1", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Hi!

It\u2019s a bit difficult to describe those inner feelings but it\u2019s something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for me it made the internal dialogue worse, despite \u201cskipping\u201d me to green.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve found it\u2019s better to drop it, even if it feels like lost progress at first. It was never really progress to begin with, maybe just a slight \u201cpreview\u201d but that\u2019s it and not possible to go further with my beginner issues still a factor.  I think having a clear sober mind is key, especially when performing tensegrity over and over again while maintaining silence and some measure of focus and laser guided intent.  Not happening with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/xs5iai/progress_report_and_feedback/iqitcqc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1664558170.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_xs5iai", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}], "before": null}}]

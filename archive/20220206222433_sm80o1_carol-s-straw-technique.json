Specifically something along the harmonic series, like the first or or second overtone might provide interesting results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, maybe sound&amp;#39;s properties could be used as a point of entry, as a way to softly move the AP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just spit-balling here, in case it might be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_sm80o1", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/sm80o1/carols_straw_technique/hvybmvz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1644247076.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1644247076.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hw3g2fp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1644336015.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hw0ls5d", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;Which book?

Keen.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But ya, I&amp;#39;m more of an experimentalist and any &amp;quot;technique collecting&amp;quot;\nis performed as-needed, the un-used ones fall by the wayside.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But ya - some are emamled by the glamour of the path, abusing it&amp;#39;s lure for their own hypnosis, hoping to dazzle others into feeding their own self-importance.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;#39;m only important enough as an expression of the moment, here to press what is already ready to pitch itself.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s likely one of the real keys of sorcery, stalking and storing enough energy to more than surpass one&amp;#39;s own percieved belief boundaries, but to &amp;quot;handle it&amp;quot; when the actual thing occurs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frank Zappa sings of the &amp;quot;collector&amp;quot; - &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtx4ZJ1cwI0\"&gt;Cosmic Debris&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpjJuxk2DiQ\"&gt;You can be scared when it gets to real&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;quot;but keep your eye on that ball, because it might just be a One Shot Deal.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while we&amp;#39;re at it, &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8HMCfXmVc0\"&gt;Inca Roads&lt;/a&gt;, just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_sm80o1", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/sm80o1/carols_straw_technique/hvyodhh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1644252185.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1644252185.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hvxc8h5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hvx8u8m", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;The beat entrains our awareness which in turn modulates our AP's position, just slightly.\n\nI've concluded the same just now in the darkroom.

This makes sense.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even shifting one&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;attent&lt;/em&gt; can issue physical clicks, shifts and glitches.&lt;br/&gt;\nMoving a finger is akin to beating a drum.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey... thanks for posting.&lt;br/&gt;\nOz&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_sm80o1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/sm80o1/carols_straw_technique/hvx8u8m/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1644223207.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1644223207.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hvvclfl", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1644187614.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hvv3fud", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I have those.

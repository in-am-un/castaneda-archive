Then, like a shaman, he dispatched his soul upward through seven heavenly halls, trying to reach the highest celestial world that contains God\u2019s throne of Glory, and the chariot (merkavah) that supports it. Once there, the Merkabah Rider would try to penetrate the veil surrounding the Throne to get a first hand look at the seat of power. If he could pass the hurdles and make it to the finishing line, so to speak, the rider would so elevate himself that he would join the universal soul. Along this hard journey, there were angels who could help them. Therefore before he started on his mystic quest, the Merkabah rider would pray, prepare magical talismans, utter incantations, and sometimes practice asceticism.\r\n\r\nMetatron, according to one account was originally the mortal Enoch mentioned in the Book of Genesis as one who \u201cwalked with God.\u201d Enoch was taken straight up into heaven, body and all, and was transformed into the angel Metatron, with 365,000 fiery eyes, his flesh was turned in to flames, his intestines into fire, and his bones into embers. In the Book of Enoch, before being changed into Metatron, Enoch toured heaven, seeing the winds that blow the sun across the sky and many other wonders both glorious and terrible. Eventually Enoch was changed into an angel of fire with innumerable eyes and three dozen wings (the fire from within/entering third attention and becoming a high-energy inorganic).\r\n\r\nAs a mortal Enoch was the greatest of all scribes, and as Metatron he continued his task and became heavens secretary, recording all celestial and earthly doings down to the minutest detail. While on earth the archangel Uriel told all the universes secrets to Enoch,who took dictation around the clock for 30 days, filling 360 volumes.\r\n\r\nThe color that is associated with Uriel is ruby red, representing the power and vitality of the life force, at the root chakra. When Uriel\u2019s ruby red ray appears, it will often switch to purple with tiny flecks of gold swirling about within it (sounds a bit like the pomegranate dot to me!)\r\n\r\nKa, in Egyptian belief, the exact replica of the physical body, made up of finer, subtler matter. It guards the soul and acts as its companion both during this life and the after life (the equivalent of the dreaming body).\r\n\r\nThe seven heavens (sound familiar!) are vaulted above the earth, one on top of the other, like the skins of an onion, except for the first and the lowest heaven, which is a curtain drawn over the world during the day. The curtain is rolled back at night to reveal the cosmos, the higher heavens. The mystical Jewish book the Zohar, claims not seven heavens but 390, each with 70,000 worlds (same 7 vs. 600 worlds argument amongst Nagualists).\r\n\r\nPadre Pio, who said that he sent his own guardian angel, whom he described as petite, on errands to help others, if only to give them a feeling of comfort. \r\n\r\nAngels keep their ancient places, turn over their stone and they are there.\n\r\nOn the lifespan of angels: most agree that angels will never die, but that does not mean that they are eternal.

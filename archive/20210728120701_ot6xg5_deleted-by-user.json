Go look.  It's good to walk around. In fact, it's much better than sitting still.  So get up, go to the cellphone, and take a look.\n\nJust in case there's some lingering intent from another practice, please repeat to yourself:\n\nThis is NOT meditation.  It's not like anything else.\n\nGo talk to the meditators in a subreddit, and ask yourself if you want to end up like them?\n\nNo, you don't.   You REALLY don't.  I could tell stories...\n\nYou don't even want to end up like a  genuine \"Zen master\".  They're impotent and clueless.   I have stores about that too.\n\nMoving around is better than sitting still.  Open eyes are far better than closed.  And body position is practically irrelevant.\n\nDon't mess with your breathing on purpose.  You'll miss some of the magic of darkroom.\n\nDon't let the meditation rules alter how you practice. It can take a while to discover you were doing that.\n\nIf you go for the cellphone and actually look to see the time, the glare will burn into your eyes and teach you even more as you watch it fade away when the phone goes off.    You might even want to play with that, illuminating part of the room, and then hiding the light and looking at that part again.  In fact, you can keep the cellphone in a pocket if you like.\n\nCan't walk around?  Maybe the cellphone can do an audible alarm for you.  That's fine.  Noises don't really hurt anything unless they keep you from getting silent.\n\nEven Carlos liked quiet when he was trying to achieve the higher levels of silence.    But you won't get to those on a regular basis for a while.\n\nBut best of all is if you don't have to pay attention to time.  Eventually it'll be so entertaining, you won't even feel like checking the time.\n\nIt's no different then when your parents force you to play an instrument in school, and you keep looking to see if your half hour of practice is up.\n\nBut if you take to the instrument, you stop doing that.  You don't even notice because you sound kind of good, and it's enjoyable.\n\nIn the darkroom, that happens when you're up to your ears in amazing magic.\n\nAt that point, what determines your practice time is whether you have enough energy left.  Fortunately you can \"renew\" your dreaming energy by going back to the red zone, and scooping visible puffs onto your torso. On the 3 \"pouches\".\n\nLast night, I renewed 6 or so times.  At first using puffs.  I wanted to discover how many times you can renew.\n\nBut then I remembered you can also look up high for light, stick one hand into it, and put the other hand on the pouch you want to recharge.\n\nIf you're reaching way up high, and having to lean at an angle, that's perfect!\n\nWatch the light \"drain\" down the arm, into the pouch.  You can get a lot more to go on there, if you do that. It's less precise, but you get more energy flowing on you.\n\nBut that doesn't work as well as scooping up a puff with one hand, and compressing it with both hands like  the Pandora's Box pass.\n\nIt's in here, go take a look at that pass. Carlos really wanted us to do the compression thing, even grinning like a kid with a fresh box of candy, when he did it for us.\n\nWhen you do that,  when you form a very tight and bright puff, you get to watch the compressed ball of brilliant purple soak into your pouch and spread out to form a yellow glow.\n\nIt illuminates part of your energy body.\n\nMy guess is, it's not really better to compress the puffs, than to reach high to get the energy.\n\nProbably it causes a horizontal shift because you treated the puff as if it were a solid object.\n\nIf you have very little time, then try to find places in the day where you can practice your silence.\n\nLike driving or taking a walk at break time.", "edited": 1627483889.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h6u3vcx", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big &amp;quot;change&amp;quot; in the darkroom is when you stop worrying about the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have enough, sure.

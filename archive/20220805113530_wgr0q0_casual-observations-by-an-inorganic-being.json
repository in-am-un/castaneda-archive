Might even take him 2 hours just to get to you on a bad day.\n\nLittle Smoke had to travel billions of light years to get to Carlos!\n\nBut you always have fun together,  so he comes everyday.\n\nThen, you get 2 new friends, and some days when he comes you aren't even home for him to meet. If he wanted to hang out anyway, he'd have to track you and your new friends down.\n\nHe's not going to ditch you, but he won't make the drive everyday like he used to.\n\nIt uses up their energy to visit.  Until you figure out how to replace it and even let them come out ahead, better stick with one.\n\nThis next point is key, but I can't explain it so that others understand.  It'll be misunderstood.\n\nThere's no fixed reality.  None.  Not even that of the old seers.\n\nIt's NOT more basic, it's not a deeper truth.\n\nIt's just what they created.  Over thousands of years I might add!  So don't get fooled by bad men who make up stuff over a decade or two.  Thousands of years, is what it took to create what the Olmec had.\n\nBut that doesn't make it imaginary.\n\nWhat was created for us to live in, in our normal life,  is a chicken coop.  We've been born into a giant farm, stuck in a cage with no hope of escape.\n\nBut the cage is not the real world.  It's just a construct.  A place you can dwell a while, but in no way does it represent \"the real world\".  Compare our modern life to that of our ancestors in the world they evolved into, hunting and gathering with no language, and it's vastly different now.  Those weren't apes.  Modern man was like that for a good 250,000 years.\n\nNor does that world of the old seers represent \"the real world\".   The emanations are so vast, with endless places to explore, that the idea of a \"real\" world is completely naive.  A comforting story to tell children before bed, instead of admitting we're all lost in the dark sea of infinity.\n\nBut the world of the old seers is a MUCH BETTER cage to be stuck in.\n\nIt's vast!  And our \"chicken coop life\" is tiny.\n\nSo tonight I was in Dream Bubble Station, my phantom room, and Fancy was around.  She seems to be more interested in me the last few days.\n\nI suggested if she walk around with me, she could help stabilize Bubble Station.  Since I couldn't hold it in a single nice, \"real\" look for long enough to be satisfying.\n\nFancy suggested, \"You don't really have to.   It can be a vehicle, or a dwelling.  You want it to be a dwelling, but vehicles can take you to Silent Knowledge, where it becomes anything you like.\"\n\nI told Fancy I kind of liked it as a place so we could experiment with shared dreaming, and maybe even find the ancient seers who used it.\n\nFancy commented, \"Almost none of them died.  You do know that don't you?  They found various ways to keep going, mostly into our inorganic worlds.  But they can move back and forth, so if you aren't careful you'll run into one for real.\"\n\nI was walking along inside Bubble Station with her at that point, and just to keep things more \"on topic\" I pointed out, \"The Bubble Station Laundry is on the right here.  Hang a shirt with me.\"\n\nI had a few shirts on the bed, so we hung one up and Fancy materialized inside it to test if it was on the hanger right. It's dark in there!\n\nBut not like she used to do, back when she wore costumes.  She was brilliant when she posed the shirt for me.\n\nShe saw I was disappointed.\n\nShe commented, \"Is this your night job? Night watchman of Bubble Station?  Maybe you come in case any late night guests arrived, and need directions?\"\n\nShe added, \"I'm trying to help you out here.  You want a stable alternate reality, but there's not much of a \"back story\" behind it.  I mean, it's a little barren.  The most interesting thing here is the hole in the east wall, leading to Cholita's realm.\"\n\nI joked, \"I suppose for a good backstory you could be my wife, visiting to give me my lunch which I forgot?\"\n\nFancy liked that idea.  She asked if I wanted her to look like \"Lucy\" from that old TV show, so I could come home and say, \"Fancy, I'm home!\"\n\nI didn't like that image.  \"Lucy\" was kind of creepy, in a 1950s sort of way.\n\nAnd yet, Fancy could be creepy at times.\n\nI changed the subject, and pointed out that we didn't walk over to the lost and found yet.\n\nI was standing by the lost and found point in north east part of the room, and surprised how well formed the closet was.  The \"lost and found\" for Bubble Station is a stand alone cabinet, much like an auxiliary closet that only has shelves.\n\nFancy said that was her energy making it \"more real\" tonight.\n\nAnd that the problem with Bubble Station was, there wasn't enough residual energy to hold it stable.\n\nI opened the lost and found, and could see the objects in there.\n\n\"Careful\", Fancy warned.  There's bound to be some ancient seer objects in there.  Power objects.  You don't want to touch any of those.\"\n\nI closed the lost and found \"closet\", and told Fancy to look to the left, where the ancient seers could be seen from time to time, as an echo.  Traveling across the ley lines.\n\nFancy said, \"I like the Stellar Hatch dream better. That was a good find on your part.\"\n\nThat's the tensegrity form that resembles one of the moves in the long form Fancy designed for me, which gets more and more vivid each day.  It was so amazing tonight, it had me trying to remember if Dr. Strange does any \"warmups\" for his magic.  Doesn't he wave his arms around a bit before some cool spell?  But the waving arms preparation puts on a little light show all of its own.\n\nI couldn't remember, but Fancy commented \"That's it!  You almost understand.  You got so many examples, but everyone was too stupid to open their eyes.  What a tragedy to nearly lose all that you were given.\"\n\nShe was referring to Carlos, and his attempts to teach us.  I was starting to realize, even the silly name changes and imaginary stories about each person in his inner circle, were a lesson.\n\nIn phantom living spaces.\n\nWe're stuck in one living situation. It's a trap we are trying to escape.  Or at least, we'd like to go see what else exists for a few hours each day.  \"Go for a walk\" across the universe.\n\nBut it's too vast out there.  We need a place to go to \"start\" each journey, further into other worlds.\n\nCarlos tried to teach us about creating alternatives to our river of shit lives.  \n\nBut it wasn't new.  He wrote about the \"alternate lives\" of the Genaros, or the Little Sisters.\n\nOne sort of comes to memory.  Wasn't Pablito supposed to be Soledad's son, and Soledad wanted him dead?\n\nNone of it true, but it was a stalking situation.  And there were crazy stories about all of the apprentices.\n\nBut we misunderstood.\n\nIn our greed to lord it over others and steal from them, with our own \"sorcery teaching franchise\", we interpreted that as \"stalking\", meaning, playing nasty tricks on other people, just for the fun of it.\n\nWe interpreted the situation as trolls.\n\nStill do!  If you look around on social media in the Castaneda swamp, you're likely to run into a flasher who opens his trench coat, shows you his privates, closes it and then says, \"I'm a stalker\".\n\nBut that's not it at all!\n\nPablito wasn't in a life or death battle with his pretend Mom just to play nasty tricks on other people.\n\nIt was a phantom realm.\n\nA new \"construct\" for him to use to escape the river of shit.\n\nYou could think of it as a low spot on the bank, which Pablito had learned to use to climb out onto dry land.\n\nKylie once explained at an early workshop that her name was created by the witches, who \"were dreaming her\".  They were building her a phantom reality.\n\nAs Pablito was floating in the river of shit, helpless, he could swim over to that flat spot of being Soledad's son,  and climb out more easily.  He might even develop \"feeling\" that the story was as true as his \"other life\".\n\nBut we're talking about \"realities\" here, not an actual physical river with a bank leading to the dry land of sorcerers.\n\nSo the \"low spot\" in the bank, is really a story.  To compete with his river of shit life story.\n\nFancy suggested that Stellar Hatch was the same.  She criticized, \"Why don't you all listen to the stories in the videos more?  Don't think think Carlos wrote the story Kylie recites, in the video that teaches that pass?\"\n\n\"Did you think that story wasn't important?  It wasn't a cult leader sales pitch!  It was a magical gift!\"\n\nI tried to figure out what she meant, and then realized it was in fact a very vivid story.  And it explained a piece of the reasoning and doings of the old seers.\n\nFancy suggested, \"It shows the flow of their intent, into a stable structure!  And Carlos gave it to you.  Along with MANY others.\"\n\nI asked Fancy, \"Can we really use it, to meet the old seers?\"\n\nShe replied, \"They aren't dead yet.  You know that.\"\n\nI suggested there was \"nowhere to go\".  So even if a person mastered what Carlos had described in that video of \"Stellar Hatch\", something I'd tried just a half hour before and found would not be all that difficult,  what then?  You send your ball up, and you get back freed energy.  You used the form to \"uncrust\" more shiny outer coating, or perhaps pieces of the double that didn't scrape off the walls well yet.  And you move that energy up and down.\n\nWhere do you end up?   Can it be turned into a phantom room like my Bubble Station, where you'll find the old seers who created it?\n\nFancy answered, \"They'll notice.  That's what Carlos did.  The lineages have always done that.  They never lost contact with the old seers.  Because following their intent, insures you'll run into some.\"\n\nI reasoned that don Juan wouldn't have shared this with us. It's not useful to beginners to know about it.\n\nI asked Fancy, \"So Bubble Station is like the story part of the tensegrity forms on video, and each of those can become a phantom reality bubble we can travel to, as a starting point for moving further?\"\n\nShe replied, \"Yes.  But also the stalking stories told about apprentices work the same way.  It's stalking to hold the assemblage point in a good place to leave the river.  Not a practical joke to get attention from others.\"\n\nI suggested she was implying there was nothing wrong with my Dream Bubble Station obsession for now, because it makes a perfect starting place to build in the evenings, before I explore Silent Knowledge.\n\nFancy answered, \"As long as you know it's a choice, you could make it work.  But it needs a woman's touch to make it more real.  And there's the problem.  Men and women create different stories.  Play games differently.  You can't play nothing but cowboys and indians all the time.  The girls want to play tea, and dress up make believe sometimes.  So if you want a woman's touch around here, you have to be more flexible on the rules of the game.\"\n\nLater I was sitting on the edge of the bed wondering if I had enough dreaming energy left to fully reach Silent Knowledge.\n\nAnd I hadn't seen my witch friend cross over into the room yet.\n\nSitting still during darkroom is one of the \"moods\" I learned about, but they're easy to ignore.\n\nMoving is not the same as waiting, or resting.  And once you get more advanced at darkroom, the room is anything but dark.  You really are exploring real places.\n\nAnd resting is when something new can come in to the situation.\n\nI was gazing at the floor just trying to see how much dreaming energy I had left, and an intense purple cloud floated up.    It was a little out of place, because my assemblage point had moved far out of the red zone, and everything tends to bleach out.  So such a strong purple puff was slightly surprising.\n\nFancy was there.  She said, \"That's not you idiot!   It's your witch.\"\n\nI looked into the purple puff, and there in fact was the face of that double being who passed through the tunnel fully, just once so far.\n\nThe last time she didn't come through completely, but gave me a purple puff to keep on the floor.  An intense purple puff, burning brightly down there near the west wall.\n\nFancy explained, \"It's still here for now. But not if you ignore it.  You've made a container.  A phantom realm.  A dream that's more interesting than random phantom worlds.  Of course a piece of her energy body sticks around.   Our dreaming doubles don't usually remain in just one location at a time. They have interests all over.  And this is an interesting place to use as a starting point for exploration.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Casual Observations by an Inorganic Being", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Stalking"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"t3vn3giu2vf91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 130, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t3vn3giu2vf91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2ec10228e7aa43970c644df1faac60037c0a03f"}], "s": {"y": 246, "x": 204, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t3vn3giu2vf91.png?width=204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c58e75324542ad0fb21caf12befc5511b1fa6ef"}, "id": "t3vn3giu2vf91"}}, "name": "t3_wgr0q0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Stalking", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/W56zc1StE9OzqrR00rTZFWBZ1gd6vZkKS4sUlWGShZE.jpg", "edited": 1659708269.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1659692130.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/t3vn3giu2vf91.png?width=204&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8c58e75324542ad0fb21caf12befc5511b1fa6ef\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/t3vn3giu2vf91.png?width=204&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8c58e75324542ad0fb21caf12befc5511b1fa6ef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of realized in the last couple of  days that keeping more than one inorganic being, the way the old seers tended to keep 3, is not the ideal situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s sort of like having a good friend who lives all the way across town, and to visit he has to battle horrible traffic.

She seems to be more interested in me the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggested if she walk around with me, she could help stabilize Bubble Station.  Since I couldn&amp;#39;t hold it in a single nice, &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; look for long enough to be satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy suggested, &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t really have to.   It can be a vehicle, or a dwelling.  You want it to be a dwelling, but vehicles can take you to Silent Knowledge, where it becomes anything you like.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told Fancy I kind of liked it as a place so we could experiment with shared dreaming, and maybe even find the ancient seers who used it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy commented, &amp;quot;Almost none of them died.

But they can move back and forth, so if you aren&amp;#39;t careful you&amp;#39;ll run into one for real.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was walking along inside Bubble Station with her at that point, and just to keep things more &amp;quot;on topic&amp;quot; I pointed out, &amp;quot;The Bubble Station Laundry is on the right here.  Hang a shirt with me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a few shirts on the bed, so we hung one up and Fancy materialized inside it to test if it was on the hanger right.

If you look around on social media in the Castaneda swamp, you&amp;#39;re likely to run into a flasher who opens his trench coat, shows you his privates, closes it and then says, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a stalker&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s not it at all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pablito wasn&amp;#39;t in a life or death battle with his pretend Mom just to play nasty tricks on other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a phantom realm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A new &amp;quot;construct&amp;quot; for him to use to escape the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could think of it as a low spot on the bank, which Pablito had learned to use to climb out onto dry land.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kylie once explained at an early workshop that her name was created by the witches, who &amp;quot;were dreaming her&amp;quot;.  They were building her a phantom reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Pablito was floating in the river of shit, helpless, he could swim over to that flat spot of being Soledad&amp;#39;s son,  and climb out more easily.  He might even develop &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; that the story was as true as his &amp;quot;other life&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#39;re talking about &amp;quot;realities&amp;quot; here, not an actual physical river with a bank leading to the dry land of sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the &amp;quot;low spot&amp;quot; in the bank, is really a story.  To compete with his river of shit life story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy suggested that Stellar Hatch was the same.  She criticized, &amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t you all listen to the stories in the videos more?  Don&amp;#39;t think think Carlos wrote the story Kylie recites, in the video that teaches that pass?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did you think that story wasn&amp;#39;t important?  It wasn&amp;#39;t a cult leader sales pitch!  It was a magical gift!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to figure out what she meant, and then realized it was in fact a very vivid story.  And it explained a piece of the reasoning and doings of the old seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy suggested, &amp;quot;It shows the flow of their intent, into a stable structure!  And Carlos gave it to you.  Along with MANY others.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked Fancy, &amp;quot;Can we really use it, to meet the old seers?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She replied, &amp;quot;They aren&amp;#39;t dead yet.  You know that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggested there was &amp;quot;nowhere to go&amp;quot;.  So even if a person mastered what Carlos had described in that video of &amp;quot;Stellar Hatch&amp;quot;, something I&amp;#39;d tried just a half hour before and found would not be all that difficult,  what then?  You send your ball up, and you get back freed energy.  You used the form to &amp;quot;uncrust&amp;quot; more shiny outer coating, or perhaps pieces of the double that didn&amp;#39;t scrape off the walls well yet.  And you move that energy up and down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where do you end up?   Can it be turned into a phantom room like my Bubble Station, where you&amp;#39;ll find the old seers who created it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy answered, &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;ll notice.  That&amp;#39;s what Carlos did.  The lineages have always done that.  They never lost contact with the old seers.  Because following their intent, insures you&amp;#39;ll run into some.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reasoned that don Juan wouldn&amp;#39;t have shared this with us. It&amp;#39;s not useful to beginners to know about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked Fancy, &amp;quot;So Bubble Station is like the story part of the tensegrity forms on video, and each of those can become a phantom reality bubble we can travel to, as a starting point for moving further?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She replied, &amp;quot;Yes.  But also the stalking stories told about apprentices work the same way.  It&amp;#39;s stalking to hold the assemblage point in a good place to leave the river.  Not a practical joke to get attention from others.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggested she was implying there was nothing wrong with my Dream Bubble Station obsession for now, because it makes a perfect starting place to build in the evenings, before I explore Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy answered, &amp;quot;As long as you know it&amp;#39;s a choice, you could make it work.  But it needs a woman&amp;#39;s touch to make it more real.  And there&amp;#39;s the problem.  Men and women create different stories.  Play games differently.  You can&amp;#39;t play nothing but cowboys and indians all the time.  The girls want to play tea, and dress up make believe sometimes.  So if you want a woman&amp;#39;s touch around here, you have to be more flexible on the rules of the game.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later I was sitting on the edge of the bed wondering if I had enough dreaming energy left to fully reach Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I hadn&amp;#39;t seen my witch friend cross over into the room yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sitting still during darkroom is one of the &amp;quot;moods&amp;quot; I learned about, but they&amp;#39;re easy to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moving is not the same as waiting, or resting.  And once you get more advanced at darkroom, the room is anything but dark.  You really are exploring real places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And resting is when something new can come in to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was gazing at the floor just trying to see how much dreaming energy I had left, and an intense purple cloud floated up.    It was a little out of place, because my assemblage point had moved far out of the red zone, and everything tends to bleach out.  So such a strong purple puff was slightly surprising.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy was there.  She said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not you idiot!   It&amp;#39;s your witch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked into the purple puff, and there in fact was the face of that double being who passed through the tunnel fully, just once so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last time she didn&amp;#39;t come through completely, but gave me a purple puff to keep on the floor.  An intense purple puff, burning brightly down there near the west wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy explained, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s still here for now. But not if you ignore it.  You&amp;#39;ve made a container.  A phantom realm.  A dream that&amp;#39;s more interesting than random phantom worlds.  Of course a piece of her energy body sticks around.   Our dreaming doubles don&amp;#39;t usually remain in just one location at a time. They have interests all over.  And this is an interesting place to use as a starting point for exploration.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "e041b6bc-6005-11ea-a799-0edc1fd152bd", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "wgr0q0", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/wgr0q0/casual_observations_by_an_inorganic_being/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/wgr0q0/casual_observations_by_an_inorganic_being/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1659692130.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ij259c1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1659710523.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ij1q2v5", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That's what Cholita is trying to use as a trap for a visiting witch.\n\nNot that specific look.

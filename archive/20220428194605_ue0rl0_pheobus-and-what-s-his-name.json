But why???\n\nAll of the teaching in the first books was Devil's Weed and Little Smoke. If you think the power plants were doing that, you're confused.\n\nAnd there's a quote from don Juan saying it's impossible to do what sorcerers do, without the dark energy of the inorganic beings.\n\nWe pretty much MUST visit with them, and soak up dark energy. That's why both the first and second gate of dreaming, are to get you some dark energy from the inorganic beings.\n\nMy theory is, if you can't do something, but pretend you can, just claim the parts you can't do, are \"evil\".\n\nProblem solved!  Instead of admitting you're a fake, you just claim to be a \"superior being\".\n\nA host of bad rumors about Carlos were created after his death, based on Daoist's not understanding spirits.\n\nPerhaps waiting for him to die so they could piss on his leg?\n\nHere's all the references to \"Phoebus\" in the collected workshop, book signing, and lecture notes.\n\nPlus what brought them up.\n\nPheobus and ?lobus are the Allies of the witches.  Looks like they're mostly Taisha's?\n\nTechno was talking about whether we could increase the \"coziness\" of the subreddit.  So people we \"hose off\" as they emerge from the river of shit, don't dive back in.\n\nHe suggested audio lectures, a new reddit feature.\n\nI suggested Cholita's belly dancing.  Without asking Cholita...\n\nA scary witch suggested we don't want that kind of self-absorbed \"let's all hang out\" kind of activity in here.\n\nOk...\n\nThat was me.   The witch just backed me up.\n\nI suppose one answer to the \"cozy\" of the River of Shit, is the \"cozy of your Allies\"?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nAt one point Taisha showed us the slide of the voladore in Mexico. When the picture went up on the screen, we noticed a large-winged bug next to it. It almost looked as if it was part of the picture. Since I was sitting quite close (second row) I knew it was not. Still it was startling, and funny. On the next enlargement, it came back, right next to where the voladore was projected on the screen. Even Taisha laughed/commented. I was looking at it, and it moved, and then was gone. I thought it was funny that I didn't see it fly off the screen, but I figured it must have flown straight up, or something (in retrospect, there was no logical explanation, but it was only a bug - right?) The next night Florinda asked us if anyone noticed that the bug disappeared. She said it was Lobus and Phoebus\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe nine ways to move the AP: Taisha said that dreaming and stalking are put last in the list, because by the time we get to them, we will have to have built up enough awareness to get above the ankles.\n\nThe energy of the stars: In the tensegrity movements, the foot pass \\[number 1 of the second series\\] mixes impersonal energy of the stars with the area of self-reflection in the foot. Another one of the star groups they had to know was the belt in the constellation of Orion.\n\nRecapitulation: you can do it in public using an inner breath. You don't have to turn your head.\n\nGlobus \\[?\\] and Phoebus: Taisha sleeps with them every night that she sleeps in her attic, and cuddles up with them. She says they are becoming more and more real as she matches her speed with theirs.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"Women are 50% inorganic beings--they just have to quiet the internal dialogue and they'll become 'tubular'\" (i.e., like the inorganic beings). Taisha said she had two inorganic beings that lived in her attic: Globus and Phoebus. \"They are individually identifiable inorganic beings.\"\n\nShe said that her personal assemblage point and energy shape \"is heading toward that of the inorganic beings,\" allowing her increasing glimpses of her \"lodgers.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"Tonight Carol Tiggs couldn't come.\" She made it to Mexico City, but really wanted to come to Omega to use this workshop as an \"echo chamber,\" to explain where she'd been during the 10 years that she was gone. \"Carol Tiggs hadn't wanted to go to Mexico--where she needed translation for material that depends on subtlety. But she went there to practice telling the story of her experience. She manifested there, and didn't return as the Carol Tiggs we knew.\n\nThat's why we are all working to bring her back.\" Carol Tiggs had taken the Chacmools to Tula--\"not the dirty, modern-day city, but a quiet, ancient version--by bringing us into her dream. Taisha did the same with you last night, with the help of Globus and Phoebus. Before last night, the Chacmools didn't know about Taisha's inorganics. Whenever Taisha talks, however, there's always some kind of interference, whether it is trouble with the lights, sound, or something. The 'insect' that appeared on the slide of the Voladore last night didn't fly away . . . it disappeared! The strange 'insect' that matched up with the Flyer, like it was superimposed, was Globus and Phoebus.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nTaisha is in fact similar to Florinda in height and stature, very slim and fit, perhaps in her fifties, but very vital. \\[Note: my perception then, but she's actually much taller!\\] Her hair is still reddish gold, but worn very short, like all of the sorceresses save Carol. She also has a quick and mischievous smile, and seems the most accessible of the group--several times between sessions she could be seen at the center of a crowd.\n\nShe told us that her two allies were with her, and that she called them Phoebus and Globus. She explained that the inorganic beings are not fearsome at all, that in fact they were sources of the boundless abstract affection that sorcerers seek, and as such were more like pets than anything else.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nCastaneda told us that Florinda had some thirty-year old photos of herself doing karate. \\[Actually, 25-years-old, if they are the ones in Samurai magazine issues dating to 1974 and \u201875.\\] Castaneda thought they were \"fantastic,\" because they showed that \"she is younger now than she was thirty years ago.\" Florinda, who did not like the pictures, tried to get rid of them all, but he saved \"some of the best, that most showed how different she was then.\" She thought he was saving \"the worst ones of her, to use against her,\" so she stole them out of his room. When he approached her about it, she claimed \"The Inorganics took them!\" According to Castaneda, Florinda \"made a solemn accusation against the inorganics,\" specifically accusing Globus and Phoebus \\[Taisha\u2019s \"pet\" inorganics\\], but \"that\u2019s not something you can do lightly.\"\n\nHe told us she was \"really taking a risk\" doing that. So finally, after a week or so, she \"broke down and admitted that she had taken them; she couldn\u2019t go through with it.\" In the meantime Castaneda had asked Taisha, and \"Taisha never does anything like that . . . why would she take them?\" Taisha had told them to \"Fuck themselves.\" So Florinda had destroyed the pictures.\n\n\"Things do disappear,\" he stated, and when they do, \"it\u2019s a sign of inner silence having been reached.\" He told us that Ellis had brought over a bunch of pictures, including all of the ones showing her having ice cream with her father in different parts of the world--\"in Greenland, Antarctica, Paris and Rome, everywhere they had themselves photographed eating ice cream.\"\n\nNothing happened to them, so he had given them back to her, but she had left the ice cream pictures with him, and ultimately they disappeared. He told us Ellis had obtained her father\u2019s bible for him, and it was heavy so he had stored it on something near this tub. He explained that he had wanted a bible so he could \"channel\" his \"Reverend Osgoode character\"--the fundamentalist preacher that he imitated--but he did not want to buy one. Florinda had plumbing problems--they called it the \"Day of the Yellow Shrimp\" because the tub backed up with run off from the toilet. So the Bible that had been sitting there was literally \"full of shit.\" It also affected other things that had been sitting there for awhile, including \"papers of the Leperchun,\" meaning Tycho--the so-called Orange Scout. Those papers had not disappeared after ten years. \"But there is something not human about the Leperchun anyway,\" he asserted, so it somehow made sense that her stuff had not disappeared. Nyei had placed a stack of her yearbooks there and they had also disappeared.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"Taisha and Florinda became karate experts. I had the picture of them. Florinda stole it.\" Florinda interjected, \"We looked like concentration camp survivors.\" Castaneda countered, \"No, from the nuthatch.\" He described the uniforms they were wearing. Florinda told us, \"They were pictures I had taken for an article in a magazine advertising karate. I had removed the pictures and blamed it on Globus and Phoebus, but I ultimately confessed. But you were going to show those pictures.\" Castaneda responded, \"Ah yeah, well it's a good thing you destroyed them then. Thank you. Thank you Florinda.\"\n\n\"The martial arts connection with Tensegrity goes back to the Nagual Lujan, but after him, we had just the form of his movements without the rationale. It wasn't until Clara B\u00f6hm, with her martial arts training, formalizing the number of movements we should do, that the rationale was restored for the movements. Originally I was doing the movements in the way the sorcerers did them, which was shittily. They weren't good at movement, they were focusing on perception and changing perception, so movement wasn't really their fort? But I wanted both.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFelix Gutsmuths and I attended, along with most of Cleargreen. \\[Nury played several roles including that of a helpless inorganic worrying about imagined disasters likely to plague Taisha in \"Globus and Phoebus Save the World\" with Carol; \"Space Pirates in Search of the Golden Behind\" with Zaia and Halley; \"The Burden of Decision-Making,\" a brief dialogue between two self-absorbed roommates trying to get advice from each other on their outfits for a party, with Zaia; \"Man\u00a1\u00afs Best Friend,\" a skit about two hunters encountering a flyer, with Kylie; \"The Proper Spirit,\" a rather precious piece featuring a floating head and spiritual mediums, apparently written by Nuri, with Erin and Darien; and \"Love Among Insects,\" with Halley.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Pheobus and \"What's His Name\"...", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ih7rpa7u0bw81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ih7rpa7u0bw81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04f2fdd180f7cde84e762aa4646da65ef17d308a"}, {"y": 120, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ih7rpa7u0bw81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a97c29f14d941c7bed945d8aa54bf3c0ae112ca6"}, {"y": 179, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ih7rpa7u0bw81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df156e09a95049eb7641751c85043f8650a4d520"}, {"y": 358, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ih7rpa7u0bw81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b8e3e724ffe0bdfb1150938bb0a1316a5f7ad90"}, {"y": 537, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ih7rpa7u0bw81.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4be0826e32d2081807852ebf2f5504867f198ab"}, {"y": 604, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ih7rpa7u0bw81.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a0a1049cbe36de1861ce2d0a495783b76edbdb9"}], "s": {"y": 672, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ih7rpa7u0bw81.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9478dc6091b30066ee19b0021cf11bf61d3c15f6"}, "id": "ih7rpa7u0bw81"}}, "name": "t3_ue0rl0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tCpM68rI1ylTC5py2GpF3lsulIz8S1z3C3bjbs-H9wo.jpg", "edited": 1651168245.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1651167965.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ih7rpa7u0bw81.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9478dc6091b30066ee19b0021cf11bf61d3c15f6\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ih7rpa7u0bw81.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9478dc6091b30066ee19b0021cf11bf61d3c15f6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brainwashed by pretend sorcerers to be afraid of inorganic beings?

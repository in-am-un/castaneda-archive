Including details.\n\nI had such a series of clarifications last night. One was that the recapitulation ought to restore our pre-language internal dialogue, which is composed only of images, to help your assemblage point move slightly to remember that event.\n\nBut we all have WORDS in our mind while doing it, and words are a hellish mix of remembering, and self-pity. Self-pity is specifically what drives the energy body away in the first place!\n\nAnd thus recapitulation has NEVER produced the kind of magic it ought to. The kind present in the books, never happened for anyone in our entire community.\n\nOr the reputation of Carlos would not have fallen so low on the internet.\n\nIt's a tragedy! How about we do Recap RIGHT for a change, and remove that internal dialogue, using recap to clear out the \"images\" which remain when our language is shut off, so that we are finally face to face with the raw emanations?\n\nThat's why Carlos could go back in time and relive the events! Recapitulation leads to SILENT KNOWLEDGE.\n\nAnother insight I had last night came when, on getting up in the middle of the night to practice, I stretched as I imagine don Juan must have stretched. As mentioned a few times in the books.\n\nI was in pain from doing a chore for Cholita.\n\nAnd my energy body VISIBLY swarmed me, following the stretching movements. I hadn't even begun practicing, and I felt the intense magical \"bliss\" of being able to see through tunnels of reality, into alternative worlds.\n\nWith my eyes open! So don't any of you meditation junkies get too excited by that word \"bliss\".\n\nYour bliss is no different than jogger's high. Any mediocre witch kicks your bliss filled meditation master butt.  Including the Buddha himself (if he had ever actually existed in the first place, which he didn't.)\n\nThe bliss of sorcerers is the joy of seeing anywhere in time and space, and knowing you can travel there in your physical body, if you want to.\n\nI even noticed you can play with your energy body pieces at that point. As they start to swarm. They were still fluid, and hadn't clung to my physical body yet.\n\nBut please don't anyone fake this! You can't get out of hard work. There's no secret shortcut, unless all you are really after is pretending, so you can bully others and steal attention and money.\n\nThe real thing is BEYOND WORDS!\n\nHowever, those of you who do Yoga stretching might want to try to quite the mind, and see if your energy body doesn't swarm you after all.\n\nThe delusional \"posture names\" don't help, and Yoga is a system of greed and theft based on pretending you'll get magic which you never do. And which no guru does either.\n\nBut there are some good aspects to it, and that includes the stretching.\n\nKeep in mind, if you are focused on greed, even something as \"benign\" as wanting to be a Yoga teacher, you have greatly hindered your ability to learn real magic.\n\nYou have to be focused on REAL MAGIC, and nothing else, if you expect to learn to do what you see here.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Oldest Tensegrity Move", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"wsvjnzbxt9rc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wsvjnzbxt9rc1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dcae8ac4fadbe5da69cc6c566a1332dcc5a8adc"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wsvjnzbxt9rc1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f74cf7057be461b338fb464a2ecc7ecdf683e67"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wsvjnzbxt9rc1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=770b8a57563626441809a88054cf2cfd7710a6c5"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wsvjnzbxt9rc1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc03ee6c91513b91602b0f72fba3437d880d1eb1"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wsvjnzbxt9rc1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46479af9287d8a2dca3653803758dbb92808795a"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wsvjnzbxt9rc1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d98ceb919a69c461d1cdda6b58e5885f3714f126"}, "id": "wsvjnzbxt9rc1"}}, "name": "t3_1bqood6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-QqJ-d7kIt_KKrpgulwQ0mGFvdnS3kW7MUVlPbXRWN8.jpg", "edited": 1711735633.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1711717162.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wsvjnzbxt9rc1.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d98ceb919a69c461d1cdda6b58e5885f3714f126\"&gt;I said \\&amp;quot;Draw me an Old Yaqui Gentleman living where the Yaqui Wars ended.\\&amp;quot; So he had an Eagle feather stuck in the back of his hair.

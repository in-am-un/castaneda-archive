If you notice any \"practical magic\" that might explain a particular piece of silent knowledge functionality, mention it. Like the talking lizards. That's a silent knowledge ritual which summons a very specific capability given to sorcerers by silent knowledge.\n\nI'm wondering how many more there are, which I've forgotten.  The early books might in fact be one of our most valuable resources!  The moth dust that shows mushrooms, traveling using sound.  What else is in there???\n\nThey ALL become available once you can reach silent knowledge.\n\nThe men of knowledge had a tough time, and could only access the ones for which they had a ritual.  We have access to ALL of them.\n\nBut what are they?\n\nSo there's a lot of good in the books.\n\nBut when they're misused it gets really ugly.\n\nIt becomes the very thing that has rid the world of magic.  The \"flier's mind\".\n\nI had to boot a user from facebook this morning. Started arguing about the double, trying to imply the double only appears if you're using sleeping dreaming, and your body is still laying in bed.\n\nClaims to have read all the books multiple times, but clearly he's got some \"book deal\" in his mind on the side, and I've contradicted the main premise of whatever he's planning to con people with.  He started demanding I explain.\n\nOn facebook.  So he could be the center of attention.\n\nIt's typical. When someone asks a question like that there's a really ugly motivation not so far away you can't easily spot it if you look around.\n\nA childish motivation!\n\nCarol Tiggs feels the same way.  People try to establish themselves as important by asking book inventory related questions.  At her last workshop she told the audience she wouldn't take any questions about the books.\n\nPeople, especially the Euro-Buddhist types who are looking to justify their own belief that Buddhism is superior,  as questions such as \"On page 42 of Eagles gift it says yyyy.   But now you say xxxx???\"\n\nFirst of all, you CANNOT learn sorcery that way.\n\nWhat you think you know, has nothing at all to do with sorcery.\n\nI got an ASTONISHING lecture on that early this morning. From Silent Knowledge.\n\nI had no idea...\n\nAnd there's no use to try to write it up.  Maybe animate it later. That might work.\n\nEssentially the lecture said that ALL of what we do is stalking, and that we've been blind to that because we can't *see* well enough.\n\nAnd that \"infinity theater\" is inevitable for sorcerers.  It suggested my cartoons will just be a new form of \"intending through stories\". \n\nThey ARE infinity theater.\n\nThat came with some concrete examples in the air around me. Apparently Tensegrity forms \"reality caves\" around the practitioner, and the cave walls start to shine light on the person during the day, allowing their assemblage point to move.\n\nWhich I must admit, has in fact become visible to me.\n\nEach tensegrity form creates a cave around you, which lingers at some level.\n\nBut our daily world does the same.  Everyone is stuck in their own \"shitty cave\".\n\nRiver of shit, caves of shit...\n\n\"Stalking\" is the process of creating new caves to live in.  Which are fully visible once you can \"see energy\".\n\nBut I'd have to animate that.  It's not convincing in words. Yet if seen visually, I'm pretty sure it'll become obvious.\n\nAs for Carlos saying not to read the books, what he specifically said was \"I wrote the books to hook you.  You're hooked.  Now you have me right in front of you.  So stop reading the books of Carlos Castaneda.\"\n\nOr something similar.\n\nI found it extremely good advice, because I hadn't read his last 5 publications.\n\nThe \"how to\" books.\n\nSo on my own I discovered some new things mostly only covered in those books. And read about them afterwards, out of worry that I had gone astray somewhere along the line.  Only to find out, that's exactly what ought to happen.\n\nWhich is a LOT more convincing than if you read it and \"discovered\" it under that influence of already having heard about it.\n\nSorcery is tricky, because you're moving your assemblage point into \"uncharted\" realities.\n\nIf someone tells you to watch out for Evil Clown inorganic beings, then you'll surely run into one.\n\nThey have no organic body!  What you see comes from you.\n\nMostly.\n\nBut if you saw evil clowns constantly, and no one had ever mentioned it to you, then you read about it, that's entirely different.\n\nSo Carlos had three reasons for doing that, one of which was somewhat supernatural.\n\nMeaning, he told us because he \"read it off the wall\".  I saw  him doing that.\n\nHe was standing in front of us lecturing, looked off to the south and slightly east just over the horizon, and started reading whatever text came from infinity.\n\nHe often did that.\n\nThis time it was a command to stop reading the books.\n\nYes, he was annoyed. And yes, memorizing facts does absolutely no good for learning sorcery.\n\nLook in here!  Anyone who shows up and reads everything but never practices, learns absolutely nothing useful.\n\nI dare say what's in this subreddit kicks the butt of every \"wise scroll\" or \"bible\" ever written.\n\nAnd yet, it won't help anyone even a tiny bit, to learn sorcery.\n\nIt's only value is to motivate them to put in the effort.\n\nExcept...\n\n If you really are working hard and learning, the books become a \"map\"\n\nAnd you won't get as lost if you have read all of them.\n\nThere's surprising stuff in that, which becomes very useful if you actually reach silent knowledge.\n\nSuch as, a woman wanting to be attractive and get men despite her advancing years, and using the Devil's weed to achieve that,  turns out to be very useful knowledge in the course of watching reality structures form.\n\nBefore that it's just some weird critique on the priorities of women, versus those of men.\n\nBut when you're gazing at all of silent knowledge flowing around you, forming weird structures, knowledge like that helps the \"smoke\" form.\n\nThere's a level of silent knowledge where you are surrounded by  shadows of people and places, waiting for an excuse to take form.\n\nIt's like a paradise of all powerful dreaming ability.\n\nA \"hub\" of dreaming, with endless exits to specific dream destinations.\n\nThat's a case where something very odd indeed has been implanted into the books, maybe by infinity.\n\nAs if someone had planned all that to be in there, as reference later when traveling in the second attention.\n\nHere's a theory:\n\nCarlos told us to \"Stop reading the books of Carlos Castaneda\".\n\nBut if you can read them as \"the books from infinity\", then it's fine.\n\nBecause you won't be thinking you understand more, each time you read them.  \n\nYou'll be thinking you understand less.", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j2mz06d", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was simply tired of being corrected by angry men trying to steal attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, his first attempt to teach in public for free failed and he had to stop doing that, because he got endless hecklers in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He switched to armed guards and locked convention center halls, with an entry fee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even then he got the same type of hecklers in the form of &amp;quot;serious questions&amp;quot; from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always trying to find a &amp;quot;gotcha&amp;quot; to present him with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should consider that it has nothing at all to do with you, and go ahead and keep reading all of the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And do me a favor.

Anyone who shows up and reads everything but never practices, learns absolutely nothing useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dare say what&amp;#39;s in this subreddit kicks the butt of every &amp;quot;wise scroll&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bible&amp;quot; ever written.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, it won&amp;#39;t help anyone even a tiny bit, to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only value is to motivate them to put in the effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you really are working hard and learning, the books become a &amp;quot;map&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you won&amp;#39;t get as lost if you have read all of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s surprising stuff in that, which becomes very useful if you actually reach silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as, a woman wanting to be attractive and get men despite her advancing years, and using the Devil&amp;#39;s weed to achieve that,  turns out to be very useful knowledge in the course of watching reality structures form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before that it&amp;#39;s just some weird critique on the priorities of women, versus those of men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you&amp;#39;re gazing at all of silent knowledge flowing around you, forming weird structures, knowledge like that helps the &amp;quot;smoke&amp;quot; form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a level of silent knowledge where you are surrounded by  shadows of people and places, waiting for an excuse to take form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like a paradise of all powerful dreaming ability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;hub&amp;quot; of dreaming, with endless exits to specific dream destinations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a case where something very odd indeed has been implanted into the books, maybe by infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if someone had planned all that to be in there, as reference later when traveling in the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a theory:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos told us to &amp;quot;Stop reading the books of Carlos Castaneda&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you can read them as &amp;quot;the books from infinity&amp;quot;, then it&amp;#39;s fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you won&amp;#39;t be thinking you understand more, each time you read them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be thinking you understand less.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_zzzzyr", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zzzzyr/abstract_waking_dreaming_ripping_dreams_to_pieces/j2mz06d/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1672672330.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1672672330.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j2kz1w5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ApprehensiveRate7423", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j2fczhc", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_ccj0p5mn", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Dan a curiosity about this request from Carlos, why did he ask to stop reading the books? many here recommend that you read the books first, I'm already on the fifth book, do you think it's a waste of time? do you have a lot of curl?

That's what makes it so unique!\n\nThere's nothing to learn.  No sacred scrolls good for anything but toilet paper to sorcerers.\n\nWell... I suppose no sorcerer \"worth his salt\" would overlook the \"collectable\" value of a sacred scroll on ebay.\n\nBut some things just become obvious in SK even if you were never taught about that.\n\nOnce you see SK with your own eyes, there are conclusions you could have drawn if you had wondered about something specific.  But didn't notice at the time.\n\nI might even add, during the time you are in SK, you could be juggling green fireballs in order to toss them into a tube to the IOB realm.  \n\nI daily do stuff that crazy and amazing, and can't draw it up at all. So I pick something simple to draw, like \"micro cobwebs\".\n\nBut at the time, you don't think anything at all about doing amazing things.\n\nOf course you're tossing green glowing fireballs into a tunnel to the IOB realm!  Doesn't everyone?\n\nLater, you can finally get around to considering it. \n\nAnd extract \"advanced topics\".\n\nLike this one!\n\nSo here goes.\n\nSure, there's \"SK Previews\" at all depths on the J curve.\n\nIt's quite possible you did indeed find the micro cobwebs!\n\nWhich makes the J curve diagram very confusing.  We've all noticed things happening \"out of sequence\".\n\nBut it probably doesn't need to be as confusing.\n\nDon Juan cleverly prepared us for just this very question!\n\nThe \"Men of Knowledge\" couldn't *see*.  Wasn't profitable to learn anyway.  Because even if you learned to \"see\", how do you make any money from that?\n\nYour customers won't give you 5 chickens to have you \"see\" cool things for them.\n\nThey want to \"see\" those cool things themselves.\n\nAnd they aren't going to spend many hours trying to learn to do that.\n\nSo the Men of Knowledge needed \"quick magic\" they could demonstrate.\n\nIn exchange for some goods or services. \n\nThey used rituals, power plants, and their ally to \"channel\" silent knowledge.\n\nIt's clear from the stories!  \n\nRituals they could duplicate for someone else, as don Juan did for Carlos. \n\nThe ritual, the ally (theirs), and the power plants.\n\nBut we're sort of doing the same with darkroom!\n\nDon't need the power plants anymore, because we're forcing silence, to allow our assemblage points to move.\n\nAnd we're doing a ritual already. Darkroom practice.\n\nAll it needs is an ally to sneak into the room, and SK can happen easily.\n\nAt the whim of a mischievous spirit!\n\nIn fact, since that's what the Men of Knowledge mostly did to demonstrate magic, we could go back and analyze the earlier books, and derive AMAZING knowledge of what SK is capable of.\n\nWe didn't get many advanced descriptions of SK abilities, in the later books.\n\nOne of these days someone needs to do that! Analyze the first 3 books for \"SK previews\".\n\nFor example, the talking lizards who will answer a single question for them.\n\nBUT, if you interrupt them, they stop talking.\n\nAnd if you had 2 questions in mind, the answer is very confusing.\n\nThose are BOTH strong attributes of silent knowledge!\n\nDon't interrupt an answer.\n\nExcept that in \"true SK\", it keeps flowing. So you don't make it stop if you interrupt an answer. You just \"changed the topic\" by asking something else. The new topic begins to flow.\n\nAnd if you asked 2 questions, it's just more entertaining!  Twice as many weird things going on.\n\nBut if you're trying to impress a customer, having the talking lizards answer 2 at once is bad for business.  He's going to wonder if you don't have \"defective lizards\".\n\nThe man of knowledge down at the other village might put up a sign, \"only first rate lizards at this wizard's home\"! and take away some or your business.\n\nNow about the second case of \"men of knowledge rituals\" channeling SK, from the books, which I can still remember?\n\nThe mushroom shapes summoned by the moth's dust.\n\nSilent Knowledge!  \n\nExcept in this case, you're looking at the answer in real time!\n\nThe question is stable and won't change, and so you just get a continuous SK flow.\n\nTwo different scenarios!\n\nBut then there's the third case I vaguely remember from the books, of staring at the ripples on the water of a stream, while listening to the sound.\n\nWhich caused Carlos to \"travel\" on the water.\n\nI don't recall the story well, but there's another \"Man of Knowledge Silent Knowledge Preview Ritual\".\n\nThose are very important to us!  If anyone knows more from the books, we should take them into account.\n\n1   So you can get an answer to a very specific question in SK mode.\n\n2   You can select a single topic, and keep it going as you extract details.\n\n3   And you can travel using SK and sound.\n\nThere must be more we were given and didn't notice that fact.\n\nAnd I'll add:\n\n4   You can use micro-cobwebs to manipulate reality directly.  You really just \"hacked into the emanations\".\n\n5  You can summon anything you like, to \"rise up from the floor\".  Phantoms, a specific person's double, clown cars, or an entire skyscraper.\n\nSo what kind of a preview might you get at beginners level?\n\nThere's really no limits!\n\nYou might have found the micro-cobwebs!\n\nOr any other SK advanced thing I write about.\n\nThe question is, will 100 people more find that?\n\nOr will each find something completely different, but equally as fun?\n\nWe don't know the answer yet.\n\nBut I suspect the \"Second Attention Quagmire\" might be a warning that there's too many \"cool things\" to learn, and it's good if you can stick with the same ones some other sorcerers learned in the past, in sequence if possible.\n\nOtherwise it's possible that you reduce your chances to learn even more.\n\nAn analogy:\n\nA 10 mile hike to the \"Golden Gazebo\".\n\nThe \"Golden Gazebo Hikers Club\" put out a \"sightseeing along the way\" pamphlet.\n\nBuy the water at the entryway, you'll need it.\n\nTry the soft drinks at mile 1, but don't eat the churros at mile 2 (people got ill from those).\n\nGo ahead and romp through the field of red opium poppies.\n\nBut stay away from the snake pit under the huge boulders on the left.\n\nWe're trying to follow the map, just because it's proven by past users.\n\nObviously if you do something wrong along that 10 mile path, your journey could fail.\n\nExcept someone ripped our map in half,  just after Carlos left.\n\nSo we don't know if it's always ok to play with the snakes.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j2k1kc8", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This actually brings up a very advanced topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me knowing that, doesn&amp;#39;t mean I ever thought about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like I knew this &amp;quot;advanced topic&amp;quot;.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or that anyone told me about it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or I read it anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But sorcery is kind of like that.

When this arrived, I was pretty sure I could be moving things around with those without moving from where I was but this didn\u2019t work when I tried. \nAlso when I move my hand sometimes in darkroom I can see a light trail behind, anything to do with the hand of the double in your picture..?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zzzzyr/abstract_waking_dreaming_ripping_dreams_to_pieces/j2jq0xq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1672607482.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_zzzzyr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

As I said, we don't mess around like the pretend magic systems.](https://preview.redd.it/9slapbl0bqt81.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44cc9cbfca588db7899b570e1a7c927474d09616)\n\nI supposed I have to tell this story again.\n\nFor a few years it was known Carlos was ill, but he kept hoping he could build \"energetic mass\", and \"jump grooves\".\n\nSwitch to another copy of reality where he wasn't ill.  But to do that, he needed \"energetic mass\".\n\nHe had spread himself too thin, with all the students he'd taken on.  Cholita says, perhaps 100 private class students.  I'd guess more like 200, if you count the ones who only came a few times.\n\nAnd some of those are certainly cashing in.  A person who went to just one private class is out there claiming to be a \"private class student\", got himself a rambo headband and a native american sounding name.  And he's charging money to teach, essentially nothing.  He's completely clueless, and only teaches them to be \"impeccable warriors\".\n\nHonestly, i think there's nothing but witches exploiting him by pretending to be \"learning\", when they just like how he looks.  And they like hanging out with other witches.  But he surely believes he's the new \"future Nagual\".\n\nCarlos was up to his ears in such bad men, especially if you take into account the huge numbers who attended workshops.\n\nOut of all of it, no one learned.  Not a single one.\n\nBut they certainly managed to drain all the energy from Carlos, who got ill and died.\n\nHe never got the \"energetic mass\" he was hoping for.\n\nWe have some of that in here!  That's why we're so careful to toss out the exploding head men, who come in here trying to figure out how to steal.\n\nTowards the very end, when his doctor told him there was no chance, Carlos decided to take drastic action.\n\nHe began to release practical magic he had wanted to leave for later. He had a plan.\n\nIt's not that his plan failed.  It was just taking longer than he hoped due to the amazing laziness of everyone attending workshop and private classes.  And he ran out of time.\n\nOne day, if you work hard, you'll understand what Carlos was doing.  There was no chance it wasn't going to work, as long as he could live another 10 years.\n\nBut he couldn't.\n\nOne of the \"dark magic\" techniques he released at the very end, was this perfectly innocent looking \"compress a ball\" pass.\n\nIt was never taught at any workshop while he was alive.  Since then, I also highly doubt it was shown.\n\nSo I gave it a name, and drew it up.  I called it, \"Pandora's Box\", because it creates phantom beings.\n\nIt's not limited to that.  It could create ANYTHING you could think of.\n\nThe principle is simple.\n\nYour energy body is not a single whole.  But neither are you.\n\nYour normal \"daily awareness\",  your Tonal awareness, is trapped in 4 main locations.\n\nThe right side of our stomach, the left side, and the area across the chest. Plus the spot at the V in your lower neck.  Half the awareness we were created with, got stuck in those organic structures.\n\nThe rest refused, and hid out inside the luminous egg that holds all of us.\n\nIt got pushed to the outside of the egg, away from our organic body in the middle, mostly because we're so messed up.\n\nIt doesn't like the strife. The grief, worry, anger, bad emotions.\n\nWho would???\n\nUsing darkroom techniques we coax it back to the middle, and place the puffs on those spots where our Tonal awareness is trapped in our \"energy pouches\".\n\nBut, the fact is  you don't have to build an \"energy body\".\n\nEach puff is an independant, intelligent being. Or capable of becoming one.\n\nThis pass takes one of those puffs, and packs *intent* into it.  You simply \"squish it\" with your hands while gazing into it.   Squish 3 times, then rotate your hands around the outside of the ball, as if it were basketball size. And go back to squishing it 3 times, down to baseball size. With the opposite hand on top.\n\nKeep switching hands until you can literally see it \"buzzing\" with intent.\n\nThere's also a \"swirly version\", so that no one obsesses over the details.  This one uses *intent*.  As long as you see results, you have the needed *intent*.\n\nBut don't pretend your magic.\n\nIf you can't see the purple puff, forget it.  You'll turn yourself into a crap magic practitioner if you pretend like all other systems do.\n\nThis ain't your grandpa's \"chi gung\".  By the way, in China, that's what Chi Gung is really for.\n\nGrandpa to pick up Grandmas at Ikea.  After some easy morning exercise in a corner park, and some chatting about grandchildren.\n\nIf you thought anyone in China really believes that \"system\", you were robbed.  \n\nTHIS actually works!!!  A chi gung master would either deny this technique, or tell you it was \"evil\".\n\nBut in fact it's fully visible, eyes open, wide awake, walking around, no drugs.\n\nIt doesn't even have to be dark.  I first learned this from the Allies of Carlos, eyes open.\n\nBut that's a bit unruly.  So unless you want to end up in a tunnel to the inorganic beings larger cave, when you were just sitting down in the sunlight watching people and cars go by, it's kind of nice to do it in a closed room.\n\nAnd darkness makes it a heck of a lot easier.\n\nThat way if you end up in the spirit world, you don't have to worry if people are watching you ask a strange spirit what's going on.\n\nAnd did I mention, the darkness makes it a whole lot easier to learn?\n\nBesides, who the hell can do this?\n\nNo one.  No buddhist, no Daoist, no Hindu, no Jewish prophet.\n\nWhatever magic they had is from something 10,000 years ago,  likely north african in origin.\n\nCorrupted 99% by greed for money.  Which didn't exist, when the magic was originally discovered.  Back then, they had no reason to lie.\n\nUnfortunately, this stuff is HARD.  \n\nYou can't charge people money, to suffer the way we do in the darkroom!\n\nYou'd go out of business fast!\n\nCrap magic is all you can sell.  Stuff designed to make everyone feel good.\n\nSo keep that in mind, when you believe you are going to combine your vast knowledge of Chinese wisdom and \"explain Castaneda\".\n\nYou'll only explain why you'll never be able to do any of what you see in here.  It's because you don't understand that magic is in the phantom realm.\n\nAnd there's only one we know of that has the real thing. It's called, \"The Intent of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico\".\n\nit's a phantom reality!\n\nJust like the Golems or Phantom beings you can make with this technique.\n\nIf you have Buddha Boy aspirations, forget it.\n\nEvery other system is delusional, spoiled by money and greed.  And people are foolish enough to believe in those, because agriculture allowed them to sit around in \"rooms\" all day, and  they have no understanding of the spirits they would have encountered, if they had remained as a hunter/gatherer species, as they evolved to be.\n\nWe evolved to discover magic throughout your lives, and we NEED it.  We need the unknown, the night, mystery, the wind, spirits.\n\nMagic!\n\nWhen you stick people in rooms and give them food, so they never have to go exploring, you end up with  unhappy people.\n\nAnd then con artists like Lao Tsu (Daoism) or the Buddha, can sell them delusional magical systems to give them some false hope.\n\nBut there's none there. It's easy to see if you look around honestly.\n\nIs this \"safe\"?\n\nNope.\n\nTough luck.\n\nThe real thing is never \"safe\".\n\nRock climbing is not safe.\n\nWatching rock climbing on TV is safe.\n\nSkydiving is not safe.\n\nWatching world war 2 movies about paratroopers in France, is safe.\n\nThis stuff, comes with risks.\n\nIf you want \"safe\", go follow the Buddha.\n\nBut your cash won't be safe...\n\nAnd you won't get any magic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Build A Golem", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"9slapbl0bqt81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9slapbl0bqt81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9345ca445bae1a0aadd6bf11d5cb62ee96edbf77"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9slapbl0bqt81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=408efedaf3b289858f78810469c43553d440a2db"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9slapbl0bqt81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=617316fc1375fd844337910da37e01b69523fe7b"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9slapbl0bqt81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c50b319ff58ad25c3dfcd557e89688bd255a1cf"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9slapbl0bqt81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=398980d2ed2d39092b4a8528fd3d606648d1ecee"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9slapbl0bqt81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d8d5be3977f9727b0dee5471e0d97337045ec88"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9slapbl0bqt81.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44cc9cbfca588db7899b570e1a7c927474d09616"}, "id": "9slapbl0bqt81"}}, "name": "t3_u4e02v", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 30, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ClOIk-yVARrMoVOU_dgB1Bw3oFN-7juxJ3TzxhVxbxI.jpg", "edited": 1650046710.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1650045974.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9slapbl0bqt81.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=44cc9cbfca588db7899b570e1a7c927474d09616\"&gt;No one is kidding you.

Are you guys familiar with Yog-Sothoth from the Lovecraft Universe? Which for me is the closest concept humanity has for god. Well I have been kind of communicating with that being for all my life. Mostly me talking to it through animals and plants or just simply to the wind so to speak. Could it be that I have had an actual conversation with an IOB humanity would consider god? I&amp;#39;m still new to this and still just reading the first book.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/19c63eh/unbundling_emanation_clumps/kk8t7p6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1706614028.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_19c63eh", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

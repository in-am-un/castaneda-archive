She even sort of agrees.\n\nMy only choice is to learn to sleep walk in public so that I remain as silent as possible. Hours a day too! I'd never have done that unless forced.\n\nI\u2019m starting to perceive the finer details of things coming from the second attention.\n\nBut even so, I still can't answer that question about how to smash Mexico into pieces.\n\nI suppose someday I can make a tensegrity technique to demonstrate it.\n\nThe \u201cBreaking Mexico\u201d series.

She has a strange obsession with Trump.\n\nI'll just add here, that angry politics were a minor feature of Carlos' private classes.\n\nI suppose it's just because people interested in new age stuff tend to be a little unhappy and angry, but pretend to be the opposite because they're so screwed up inside, they can't stand any more self-examination.\n\nThus the self-righteousness.\n\nAbout your question though (I diverged for the public good).\n\nI suppose that when you report what happens in dreaming, it almost sounds like you had a plan ahead of time, or knew something from some other experience.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason the me-too naguals are so bothersome. Maybe those bastards actually do some work, something cool happens, and then they turn it into a new \u201ctechnique\u201d, because workshop attendance is getting low.\n\nSo something impromptu, which won\u2019t work again for anyone, becomes a product.\n\nPeople stand there waving their hands around and snorting like a wild boar, or whatever the technique is, and it\u2019s all pointless.\n\nAnd you do have a plan many times in dreaming, but it\u2019s a 1 second notice plan.\n\nYou see that you can do something, so you do it. If you stopped to think about it, you\u2019d have no plan at all.\n\nAnd if you try your 1 second planned technique again, I doubt it would work.\n\nThat\u2019s probably because what you think you\u2019re doing is just a tonal representation of something from the nagual, which you can\u2019t yet perceive.\n\nCertainly, I\u2019m not to the point of being able to plan things. I suspect that\u2019s extremely advanced, as in don Juan\u2019s level.\n\nI was just frustrated that I could see Cholita walking inside a Mexican village or small city, but was banned by her to follow.  I\u2019ve seen that overhead view of dreaming a few times, sitting up cross-legged on some pillows, on my bed in darkness.\n\nHere\u2019s the procedure to see that view. You\u2019re seeing colors in darkness, you walk around and scoop them to stay awake, when your assemblage point shifts into heightened awareness (you\u2019ll know by your breathing and the sense of bliss and no longer feeling tired at all), you return to the bed to force even deeper silence.\n\nSo in heightened awareness, where you can\u2019t fall asleep because you already are, you\u2019re in a good position to force absolute silence.  That means, no internal dialogue, but also, no latent images in the mind, even if they\u2019re absent words.\n\nNo impressions. That\u2019s what it takes to \u201cstop the world\u201d. Absolute innocence.\n\nAnd let me add, so that I don't give the wrong impression. I've NEVER seen the transition that happens when you stop the world.\n\nI only see the result. It would be really cool to see the transition, but maybe you need to have been worked on by a Nagual, to do that.\n\nFor us I fear, blanking out will be the result of most major shifts of the assemblage point.  It's just how long will you blank out? We're trying to get it down below 1 second.\n\nBut stopping the world won\u2019t happen most of the times you try this technique. There are just too many cool dreaming situations along the way and you don't have to blank out to see those.\n\nFor example, you start to notice fine details of bluish grey light on the bed sheets. Lines and blobs of light. They\u2019re too organized to be random.\n\nYou look around the room to try to figure out if that\u2019s something real. Maybe your dark room has sprung a leak.\n\nBut you see nothing when you scan around.  It\u2019s all black.\n\nYou look down on the sheets, and you realize you\u2019re looking at a little city. Or a village. Or a park. You can see the paths, the buildings, and even people walking around.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cthing\u201d.  You\u2019ll see that more than once for sure.\n\nIt\u2019s an aerial view of a dreaming world. Or more like a 45 degree looking down from about 50 feet up, sort of view.\n\nHonestly, I think it\u2019s from playing video games. That\u2019s a common perspective in video games.\n\nAs Carlos famously said, to explain how he can read text from the wall, \u201cWe\u2019re readers!\u201d\n\nHe meant, our Tonal is used to reading text from flat surfaces. So when viewing something magical like \u201cthe wall\u201d, which has nearly infinite potential, the easiest thing for our brain to do is read text.\n\nOr it was for Carlos. I rarely get text. He must have done a lot more reading than I did.\n\nSo looking down at a video game perspective of a dreaming world, you get the feeling that you can easily interact with it.\n\nI could have jumped down into that scene, because of the angle. But Cholita forbid me to follow her.\n\nSo I raised my right arm and made a fist, hoping to disrupt it enough to get her attention.\n\nMostly, I'm trying to violate causality, using Cholita. If I can transfer information from me to Cholita, via dreaming, that's almost a causality violation.\n\nWe need those.    So just getting her attention would be enough, then I could ask her about it the next day.\n\nI supposed, I've discovered that shared dreaming is easy, mostly because I'm starting from *dreaming awake*, instead of dreaming. Cholita's asleep and has lost volition and lucidity, but I'm fully awake and lucid, and so I can just look around, and see if her dreams are present.\n\nTo that end, my 1 second plan was to beam dark energy in there so that she'd feel it and turn her head. Get her to remember that.\n\nBut there was no dark energy on my fist.  So  there was nothing to project.\n\nI might have used the claw to scoop some up, but there was no time.  Cholita was escaping the scene.  She was just a few inches from the edge of it.\n\nSo I shoved my fist into it, and it fractured. A big chunk, about 2 feet wide and 8 inches tall, fell into my hands. I was holding it, while also seeing that I\u2019d completely busted Mexico into pieces, which were now hanging in the air.\n\nThe details from the dream were still intact in each piece.\n\nNote to newbies; This was not a dream. I was awake, with my eyes open.\n\nTry to get past doing such things in dreaming. It\u2019s just not as convincing.\n\nI know you get tired and want to close your eyes, but that\u2019s what heightened awareness is for.\n\nTo keep you awake.\n\nSo the best advice I have for anyone who wants to be a dreamer, is learn *dreaming awake*.\n\nForget those nasty \"gates of dreaming\". They're filthy anyway.  No one ever cleans them.\n\n(Cholita has me obsessed with germs these days).\n\nAnd if you figure out how to bust Mexico using *dreaming awake*, we\u2019ll compare notes. \n\nMaybe we can even put together a workshop, and you can charge for it.\n\nI'm not allowed to profit from the destruction of Mexico.\n\nWhere's the dreaming fragment now?  \n\nGood question. I'll look for it on the bed sheets tonight if I remember. I sure hope it didn't fall on the floor after that 4 hour cleaning crew marathon.\n\nI'll get hell from Cholita if she finds it on the floor before I do.\n\nEdited: three times", "edited": 1570728035.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f37i9nv", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, sorry I missed this.

Yep, that's Carlos.\n\nIt also makes me a bit paranoid. I have to say, Carlos seems to have snatched Cholita on purpose, even before she knew about him.\n\nIn my case, there's a shadowy hispanic character I was exposed to at 9 years old.  I can't remember him well, but he sounded close to that voice. I ran into him on an anthropological dig at Tukelota.\n\nCholita is tossing all my belongs out of the house, which she still insists is merely \"my house\", and nothing to do with her.  She's just improving it, as part of her \"service\" to me.  It's only temporary.  \n\nThis is after all, only the 3rd day she's slept in the bedroom I gave her.  I only barely got her out of staying in expensive hotels these last 6 months.  The first night she slept in the car I bought her, which is now smashed up in the garage and not drive-able.  \n\nShe spent all night, last night, positioning the 2 full shopping carts of new goods from Bed, Bath and Beyond.  \n\nBut that too is just for my benefit. And she expects to get paid!!! \n\nShe believes she'll get paid once Trump stops holding her money back, maybe in conjunction with a triad Chinese man, who owns a hotel up at the tea farms on Mt. Ali. \n\nWhich is where I like to take young Asian women because I prefer them over Hispanic women of substance.\n\nSome parts of her fantasy are true, fortunately.  But I'm still celibate, so keep that in mind.  Cholita's not fond of my antics, and doesn't keep that part in mind.\n\nOne odd thing that popped up under threat of ending up in the garbage via Cholita, along with an amazing green coat from Margarita, a favorite of Carlos,  were newspaper stories from that era.  From the 60s.\n\nMy father saved them, and I got stuck with his junk when he died.\n\nOne of these days, I'll look through that box.  It's all about the heart of the country where Carlos was roaming in his early days.\n\nBut it could have just been a colorful anthropologist, or his assistant work horse, that I ran into out at Tukelota.\n\nI'd have to say that Carlos is much more effective with his 70 year old voice.  The weird kind of things he says need some authority behind them, or it's just nuts.\n\nAs for his storytelling, there's a strange thing where once you get on a roll talking about sorcery, *intent* helps out.\n\nIt's the same as my technique for visiting heaven. You tell yourself a story about heaven, while you try to think of nothing else and look for colors, laying on your side in bed with your eyes closed, at night.\n\nIf you're afraid of bishops, as Carlos clearly was, evidenced by a 2 day humorous rant he gave about them,  then you can tell a different story. \n\nGo ahead, rebel against your religion if you like!  Run away to Buddhism if you like.\n\nBut sad as it is, God is a part of the Tonal.\n\nAnd that means our local universe is saturated with the *intent* of God and heaven.\n\nBetter to stay with the sticky intent, if you can find some. The visions will flow faster.  I've been making use of Cholita's intent these last few nights, and it's a lot easier than coming up with your own from scratch.\n\nThough I would like to see someone tell the story of \"Brokeback Mountain\" while doing that technique.  It's just so wrong, but it would work anyway. \n\nAnd it might amuse *intent*.\n\nBut whatever story you tell yourself, remember:  Sorcerers are story tellers!  In fact, they're ANYTHING that will help them restore their Nagual.  Even if it's embarrassing and lame.\n\nAfter a few days of going to sleep like that, you'll become familiar with how long the story you're able to tell lasts, and how often you have to repeat it.\n\nAnd you can try to make the story longer by adding details, but it's a clumsy effort since you're doing it on the fly.\n\nThen, you start to see some depth to your closed eyes. You can't quite put your finger on it, but it's like it's a cave you're looking into, and maybe there's even some tiny specs of light in there, but they're too vague to be sure.\n\nTrying to find the dots or whatever details you sense might be in there, produces a happy feeling in the body. It's \"bliss\".  The meditation people are the masters of it, but they get stuck in the \"honey pot\" and don't move on.\n\nBliss is nothing more than the presence of the Second Attention coming out, and making us more complete.  We need both the Tonal and the Nagual to be happy.  My guess is that the Nagual helps regulate neural chemicals, especially endorphins and dopamine.\n\nWith the bliss and the video entertainment (thinking you see something), the story will improve.  And eventually your assemblage point will shift. Then you'll see colors. \n\nIn my case, a purple blob in front of my closed eyes. And the story starts to flow on it's own. Every single word becomes perfect, and details are added that seem brilliant at the time. \n\nYou wonder how you got to be so smart all of a sudden. It's the Nagual!\n\nYou now have a \"window\" into the nagual.  Look through the colors, and see what's there. But don't get excited and start to think about that next \"book deal\", so you can cash in on sorcery.\n\nIt'll all go away the instant you start thinking about how to improve your social status.\n\nI won't tell you what you'll *see* in heaven, but Carlos described it in a few places.  And I would like to say, you'll be perfectly awake while you're watching it. Not asleep. It is NOT a dream. It's **dreaming awake**.\n\nI got good enough at this technique, that while sitting in a hotel lobby on the border with Vietnam, our Singaporean rep walked up to me and asked what I was doing, sitting up on a couch with my eyes closed.\n\nHe was worried about me (by my planning), because he'd seen me down 10 large shots of whiskey in 20 minutes, the night before. It's an Asian business ritual,  usually coerced by someone who has something the other businessman wants, and has to endure the hazing.\n\nBut I voluntarily did it so that he could see.\n\nSo my visit to heaven that morning was to help get rid of a hangover.  \n\nI was involved in stalking, and he was a key component.  He was a Daoist who worried about having a stroke, and was looking for someone to teach him to meditate.  \n\nI was able to describe exactly what I was seeing in heaven, without disturbing the vision.\n\nNaturally, in the USA they'd call the paramedics.\n\nBut in Asia, they're already familiar with all of this. It's just so mixed up and embedded in traditions, that it's become ineffective.\n\nBut they do tolerate sorcery over there.\n\nIf any newbies aren't familiar with this technique, and would like to try the world's easiest sorcery technique, ideal for \"stormtroopers\" who are too lazy to be \"impeccable warriors\", ask me here.  \n\nBut apparently I edited this too many times, and just told you all you need to know.\n\nIt's nearly as good of a path to the Nagual, as Zuleica's dreaming techniques. Except it doesn't help form the energy body of the second attention. Instead, it shrinks the tonal.\n\nThat leads to some crazy things.\n\nHow'd you to like to smash off a piece of heaven, and put it into your pocket?\n\nYou could do that. If you had any pockets while you were holding that piece.\n\nIt's *intent*!  Of course you can manipulate it with a story!!! \n\nThat's what it likes best. The abstract.  A flow of play in the universe.\n\n*Intent* wants to play too!  But like any good playground monitor, it won't play petty games, get involved in anger, or anything else that doesn't make the playground a better place to be.  So forget about fussing and feeling sorry for yourself in your \"magnificent and noble mind\". It's crap to *intent*.  \n\nThe heaven technique only works because you got rid of that internal dialogue for a while, and welcomed the second attention to come out.\n\nCarlos used to channel *intent* by reading off \"the wall\".  It's a relatively simple technique, and anyone following Zuleica's path will find it.\n\nText just rolls out, like a little mouth speaking to you.  And you can read it.\n\nCarlos gave at least one entire lecture reading from it. It was just before he died, and he was emphasizing the wall, and his technique for creating directionality in the colors you can see in the darkness.\n\nI'm referring to the basketball squeeze technique I often mention, which I suggest ought to be called, \"intending directionality\".  Maybe if Cholita decides to stay with me, we can record it.\n\nEdited: four times. I'm still stuck in heightened awareness, from having Cholita to take care of.  My writings are thus a little hair brained lately. And as I've come to realize, absorbing Cholita's dark energy all night has caused me to absorb some of her personality.\n\nCholita is a scout. She reports back by telling stories. She seeks out meaning, for \"personal growth\", and creates something new from it, in story form.\n\nIt's wonderful when she gets on a run at dinner, just before she starts to laugh uncontrollably, and finally accuses me of poisoning the entire earth with chemtrails.", "edited": 1570470712.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f2w8cj5", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The voice is very young, and my first reaction was that everyone had been fooled again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then the turn of his phrase became obvious.

And you can read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos gave at least one entire lecture reading from it. It was just before he died, and he was emphasizing the wall, and his technique for creating directionality in the colors you can see in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m referring to the basketball squeeze technique I often mention, which I suggest ought to be called, &amp;quot;intending directionality&amp;quot;.  Maybe if Cholita decides to stay with me, we can record it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: four times. I&amp;#39;m still stuck in heightened awareness, from having Cholita to take care of.  My writings are thus a little hair brained lately. And as I&amp;#39;ve come to realize, absorbing Cholita&amp;#39;s dark energy all night has caused me to absorb some of her personality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is a scout. She reports back by telling stories. She seeks out meaning, for &amp;quot;personal growth&amp;quot;, and creates something new from it, in story form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s wonderful when she gets on a run at dinner, just before she starts to laugh uncontrollably, and finally accuses me of poisoning the entire earth with chemtrails.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_c1si94", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/c1si94/charley_spider/f2w8cj5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1570462627.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f2vr5yk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1570456351.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_c1si94", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Someone posted the audio of a Q&amp;A workshop type talk, not a magazine interview, that Carlos gave in 1969.

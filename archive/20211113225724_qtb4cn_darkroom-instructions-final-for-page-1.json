Here's page 1, which just introduces the ideas used in the other 3 pages.\n\nNew people came in here and didn't see everything up to this point, so they're making a few mistakes.\n\n\\#1 mistake:\n\nYOU REALLY, REALLY, REALLY CANNOT LEARN SORCERY!\n\nSorcery is NOT like that.\n\nYou've been drinking out of the phony \"system\" swimming holes.  Buddhism, Daoism, Magick, Hinduism, Qaballah, Mystic Christianity, Gnosticism.\n\nI'm sorry, but whatever those guys have isn't worth getting.\n\nJust look around for god's sake!   We have google now.\n\nDon't look at the \"gloss\" of what they have.  Don't look at what they claim.  \n\nDon't listen to the \"magic is everywhere\" nonsense.\n\nIt's not.\n\nIt's not profitable to sell the real thing.\n\nMost can't put in the work, so they make those systems easier.  \n\nBut you can't make it easier!  Doesn't work for moving the assemblage point.  Only unbending intent moves the assemblage point.  Which is the same as hard work, that you keep up, without quitting, for far longer than you'd like.  And you NEVER \"arrive\".  Next week you have to work just as hard, or harder.\n\nIt never lets up.  And there's certainly no time for chanting, or pot luck dinners.\n\nSome student get frightened if you are passing on real magic.\n\nAnd that's bad for the bottom line. So they remove the scary stuff and tell everyone that stuff is evil.\n\nTelling the truth to students, because you really care if  they learn, hurts some of their feelings.  And they'll go where it's ok to make up stuff and pretend.  So if your \"system\" needs money, you can't do that.  You have to adhere to, \"Can't we all just get along?\"\n\nNone of the others actually remove your internal dialogue, so even their leaders live in \"poor baby me\" land.   Their very understanding of reality is based on feeling sorry for themselves.   Even the highest Zen master or Yogi, has no clue what it's like without the internal dialogue.\n\nIf they did, it wouldn't take 30 years for their students to realize they're never going to learn this stuff from them.\n\nAnd again, it's not profitable if you teach people everything they need to know to succeed on their own, in a month or two.  So they don't.\n\nJust remember this: If you're packing your Buddha wisdom in your darkroom closet, you will fail.\n\nIf you scoop up a purple puff and say, \"I know what this stuff is!  Socrates wrote about it!\"\n\nYou will fail.\n\nYou can't learn this.\n\nYou have to \"lure\" the spirit to come over to  you.  And the only way to do that (as far as we know) is to hook yourself to the Olmecs.  The spirit knows those guys.\n\nHere's some \"inspirational quotes\" on this topic.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDon Juan seemed to be on the verge of revealing his benefactor's (Julian's sexual) doings, but he obviously changed his mind. He shook his head and said that I was way too stiff for such revelations. I did not insist.\n\nHe said that the nagual Elias had the sobriety that only dreamers acquired after inconceivable battles with themselves. He used his sobriety to plunge himself into the task of answering don Juan's questions.\n\n\"The nagual Elias explained that my difficulty in understanding the spirit was the same as his own,\" don Juan continued. \"He thought there were two different issues. One, the need to understand indirectly what the spirit is, and the other, to understand the spirit directly.\n\n\"You're having problems with the first. Once you understand what the spirit is, the second issue will be resolved automatically, and vice versa. If the spirit speaks to you, using its silent words, you will certainly know immediately what the spirit is.\"\n\nHe said that the nagual Elias believed that the difficulty was our reluctance to accept the idea that knowledge could exist without words to explain it.\n\n\"But I have no difficulty accepting that,\" I said.\n\n\"Accepting this proposition is not as easy as saying you accept it,\" don Juan said. \"The nagual Elias used to tell me that **the whole of humanity has moved away from the abstract**, although at one time we must have been close to it. It must have been our sustaining force. And then something happened and pulled us away from the abstract. Now we can't get back to it. He used to say that it takes years for an apprentice to be able to go back to the abstract, that is, to know that knowledge and language can exist independent of each other.\"\n\nDon Juan repeated that the crux of our difficulty in going back to the abstract was our refusal to accept that we could know without words, or even without thoughts.\n\nI was going to argue that he was talking nonsense when I got the strong feeling I was missing something and that his point was of crucial importance to me. He was really trying to tell me something; something I either could not grasp or which could not be told completely.\n\n\"Knowledge and language are separate,\" he repeated softly.\n\nAnd I was just about to say, \"I know it,\" as if indeed I knew it, when I caught myself.\n\n\"I told you there is no way to talk about the spirit,\" he continued, \"because the spirit can only be experienced. Sorcerers try to explain this condition when they say that the spirit is nothing you can see or feel. But it's there looming over us always. Sometimes it comes to some of us. Most of the time it seems indifferent.\"\n\nI kept quiet. And he continued to explain. He said that **the spirit in many ways was a sort of wild animal. It kept its distance from us until a moment when something enticed it forward. It was then that the spirit manifested itself.**\n\nI raised the point that if the spirit wasn't an entity, or a presence, and had no essence, how could anyone entice it?\n\n\"Your problem,\" he said, \"is that you consider only your own idea of what's abstract. For instance, the inner essence of man, or the fundamental principle, are abstracts for you. Or perhaps something a bit less vague, such as: character, volition, courage, dignity, honor. The spirit, of course, can be described in terms of all of these. And that's what's so confusing- that it's all these and none of them.\"\n\nHe added that what I considered abstractions were either the opposites of all the practicalities I could think of, or things I had decided did not have concrete existence.\n\n\"Whereas **for a sorcerer an abstract is something with no parallel in the human condition**,\" he said.\n\n\"But they're the same thing,\" I shouted. \"Don't you see that we're both talking about the same thing?\"\n\n\"We are not,\" he insisted. \"For a sorcerer, the spirit is an abstract simply because he knows it without words or even thoughts. It's an abstract because he can't conceive what the spirit is. **Yet without the slightest chance or desire to understand it, a sorcerer handles the spirit. He recognizes it, beckons it, entices it, becomes familiar with it, and expresses it with his acts.\"**\n\nI shook my head in despair. I could not see the difference.\n\n\"The root of your misconception is that I have used the term 'abstract' to describe the spirit,\" he said. \"For you, abstracts are words which describe states of intuition. An example is the word 'spirit' which doesn't describe reason or pragmatic experience, and which, of course, is of no use to you other than to tickle your fancy.\"\n\nI was furious with don Juan. I called him obstinate and he laughed at me. He suggested that if I would think about the proposition that knowledge might be independent of language, without bothering to understand it, perhaps I could see the light.\n\n\"Consider this,\" he said. \"It was not the act of meeting me that mattered to you. The day I met you, you met the abstract. But since you couldn't talk about it, you didn't notice it. Sorcerers meet the abstract without thinking about it or seeing it or touching it or feeling its presence.\"\n\nI remained quiet because I did not enjoy arguing with him. At times I considered him to be quite willfully abstruse. \\[\\* abstruse- difficult to penetrate; incomprehensible to one of ordinary understanding or knowledge\\] But don Juan seemed to be enjoying himself immensely.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Darkroom instructions final for page 1", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"6oflykxmnfz71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6oflykxmnfz71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76b64ed401fddc6f28cd85a025ec52d1b7d30ce5"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6oflykxmnfz71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=365b819f43c758179551e1c5470e588c02336cb7"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6oflykxmnfz71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b554dae5e84be9ae42f4233af3b590e6c50fe0ef"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6oflykxmnfz71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=591a0cf8f08f75a2653c411765f47456f47ca805"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6oflykxmnfz71.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f91e555206b90ecc119e1f8867d5e493defa9aa8"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6oflykxmnfz71.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef139d2e6bb2ba9e260eed6cb4b10e2cbb57ee2c"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6oflykxmnfz71.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9db57880db5509d3c79c18b46ffd05697b1716f1"}, "id": "6oflykxmnfz71"}}, "name": "t3_qtb4cn", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/p1wuvKq-d7lZIOOXZpR1Xd5V7OHK1NfyoLKDGY4WZTE.jpg", "edited": 1636841206.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1636840644.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6oflykxmnfz71.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9db57880db5509d3c79c18b46ffd05697b1716f1\"&gt;Barring spelling corrections, there&amp;#39;s th final page 1.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looks like good darkroom instructions will take 4 pages.

But I can't afford the time.  I have to finish my copy of the moth from the books, but able to fly for real in a virtual 3D Dance Home.  And land on a water cooler to make it burp.  Something \"Little Smoke\" did for the classes of Carlos, just before he released her to help us out. And maybe did again for Jadey, at the end of her Affection pass video.\n\nWhat I saw was followed by the most amazing set of insights on how to make the best progress learning sorcery that you possibly can.  And why some who come here can never learn it.\n\nIt started when I did my first long form in a series of perhaps 5 that I use to create bubble station. A phantom room which I believe can hook me to a much older form of sorcery.  Not that it's important to do that, but it's very intriguing and makes a good hobby that helps keep my practice very consistent from day to day, so that intent can store into it.\n\nHere's a simple way to understand why routines are good during darkroom, even though we're supposed to disrupt them during the day.  As part of the \"warrior's way\" point of view.\n\nDuring the day you're stuck in the river of shit.  The blue line on the J curve.\n\nThe routines there, keep you at that position of the assemblage point.\n\nSo disrupting them breaks some ties, and makes it slightly easier to move the assemblage point.\n\nBut darkroom isn't at the blue line.  The intent is to keep moving the assemblage point, so as to see more and more cool stuff.  Stuff that only gets cooler, if the assemblage point moves along that entire path.  So making that a routine is a positive thing, because it's a routine with the intent to escape the blue line on the J curve.\n\nWhich gets us to the goal Carlos gave us.  \"Seeing\".  Or as he decided to rename it, so we wouldn't make up a pretend version of what it is, \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nYou get silent, knowledge flows to you.  If you aren't, it doesn't.\n\nNow already, that statement implies a wrong point of view.  That's what I got to see tonight.\n\nThere's a game little girls play where they draw squares on the sidewalk using chalk, and then hop and jump through the path they create, to land at the end.  Then they jump up to turn around, and go back.  There's some bean bag tossing as I recall.\n\nI suppose I can just find a picture of that for the post, and save time so I can continue to learn to animate.\n\nNow let's say a nasty old witch decided she had to replace herself.  She was getting to the end of her life.  And didn't want there to be 1 less nasty old witch in the world, because in fact it's very rewarding.\n\nSo she pretended to be a kindly old woman living next door to the girls who play \"hopscotch\", and somehow managed to turn it into a powerful form of witchcraft for the children to use.\n\nMaybe because they're little kids, that wasn't even difficult.  Kids will believe anything an adult tells them.\n\nSo the little girls could literally play their hopscotch game,  at the end of a successful round a doorway opens up, and they get to visit a new world.  For real.\n\nThe neighbor little boys didn't like to hear they could do that, and insisted they had to \"prove it\".\n\nLet the boys watch, and see them vanish at the end of a round.  Presumably because they stepped through an invisible doorway.\n\nBut the girls refused.  The witch had trained them well.  NEVER show magic to outsiders.\n\nCholita got a lesson on that, but I have no idea from whom.  She once flaunted the laws of physics right in my face, after a drink or two over dinner.  When I made a big fuss, she never went out to eat with me again. It's been at least a year now.\n\nThe boys, frustrated, tried to do it themselves.  But it never worked.  And the key to why not, is that weren't  doing what the little girls were doing.\n\nEven though they cell phone recorded it and copied it perfectly, it still didn't do anything at all.\n\nSo they gave up.\n\nBut a new little girl moved into the neighborhood, and the junior witches taught her to play.\n\nAnd she had the precise same motivations the little witches had. I really couldn't explain what it was, because I'm on the little boys' side.  Trying to break it apart and analyze it, while visualizing how cool it will be when I can vanish.\n\nCan I do that at a boring assembly at school with the principle going on and on about the need to put your trays away in the cafeteria, to save work for the servers?  And as a junior \"political statement\", just vanish in front of the entire audience to show my boredom with the assembly?\n\nOr maybe it could land a TV show interview!  \"How to Vanish!\"\n\nClearly the motivation of the little boys, was not the same as that of the little girls.\n\nThey actually just liked socializing, and the game gave them a formal structure in which to do that, with fun rewards while they played the game.\n\nBecause they repeated it daily, it became a \"container for fun\".  For *intent* to store into.\n\nBecause they're just kids who don't know any better,  not realizing magic is a big deal, vanishing is not nearly as important to them as having a good time.\n\nAnd there you have the problem with sorcery.\n\nIt's all just emanations out there!  And our awareness flowing on them.\n\nThere's absolutely no  morals to that.  No better or worse.  Nothing to guide what works and what doesn't.\n\nIt only seems to be that way, because we're following fixed paths in the emanations created by others.\n\n\"As it was, so shall it be again.\"\n\nAn old bible saying, reworded often by scholars.\n\nThat's what's going on.\n\nNothing more.  When you start thinking what's going on is \"karma\", or \"God's plan for each of us\", and want to think and fuss and try to behave the best you can to fit into that, you're not understanding sorcery at all.\n\nI fall into that trap easily, because I find myself in an endless battle with bad men wanting to steal from our community with pretend magic.  They've buried the real thing so deep no one could find it.\n\nBut it all boils down to \"hopscotch\".\n\nThe hopscotch witchcraft does NOT work based on the moves, or the jumps or number of squares or how you turn around.\n\nIt works because it worked before.\n\nThat's just what it does.\n\nBut it only does that, if you play the very same game.\n\nWhich includes why you are playing it.\n\nThe boys were not playing the  same game at all.  Their game was about something else.\n\nI don't want to say \"attention seeking\", because that's the judgemental way to look at it.\n\nThey just simply were not playing the way little girls play it.  Little girls don't really even care who wins, as long as everyone has a good time.\n\nThey'll even change the rules if someone is losing too much.\n\nAnd doing that, they carved a path through the emanations, leaving a trail forever.\n\nA trail of \"hopscotch witchcraft\".\n\nA little girl on the other side of the world might accidentally pick up that trail, and find it pulls her to the same final effect.  A doorway opens up and she can leave this world.\n\nIt just matters how much of what the little witches did while playing their game, that she accidentally copies.\n\nWe're in the same boat!\n\nI like to accuse people who don't have the same motivations as the old or new seers, as being \"bad\".\n\nBad players.  I mean to say, someone who plays a game, but is motivated by something else.  Not the game at all.  But they pretend to want to play the game, to get the support of the whole team.\n\nMaybe they just want the free Gatorade the coach provides, and have a crush on his wife.  So they hang around, and it makes things worse for those who are serious about playing.\n\nThat's a true point of view!  Those are indeed, \"bad players\".\n\nBut it misses the point.\n\nThe Olmecs had certain motivations for doing what they did.  And those are as much of a part of the magic, as everything else.\n\nIt's all just traces in the emanations.\n\nAnd it's impossible to find such a distant and odd combination of emanations, required to do what the Olmecs could do, without the pull of the past.\n\nWithout somehow tapping into their own \"hopscotch\" game.\n\nNot just procedurally.  It even has to copy their attitude.\n\nSo when someone comes to the subreddit asking if they can \"help the police\" with the super powers they'll gain through sorcery, I'm inclined to say, \"Absolutely not!  That's a greedy motivation not worthy of the lofty goals of seers!\"\n\nAs if to be a seer you had to be noble, and deserve it.\n\nAgain, totally wrong.\n\nAnd hopefully I catch myself and explain, \"It's so hard to learn to get silent, with that motivation you'll give up.  You aren't interested in magic, it's something else you want.  And you'll soon realize you can't easily get it with sorcery.  It takes too long.  So you'll go get whatever you really wanted, somewhere else that's easier.\"\n\nThat's true too!\n\nBut it misses the point.  It's still smelling of being a moralist.\n\nAs the witches were fond of saying, \"We're not moral or immoral. We're 'amoral'.\"\n\nI always misunderstood that to be an excuse for lesbian sex orgies.\n\nThere was always a hint of that sort of thing going on in Cleargreen.\n\nOr maybe I just hoped there was.\n\nI can't recall clearly after so long.\n\nBut I really did misunderstand that.\n\nSo to point to what I'm saying here, more important to learning sorcery is, how do you look in a loincloth?\n\nBecause in fact, the old seers wore loincloths.\n\nWhich seems to have absolutely nothing to do with sorcery until you realize, it's just a \"bundle of emanations\".\n\nIt's a past that can repeat because, \"As it was, so shall it be again\".\n\nAnother way to look at it is from perfect silence.\n\nIt can be done in imperfect silence, but in perfect silence you aren't thinking about stuff that lights up emanations not wanted.\n\nWorry about the boss and his bad view of your job performance, only makes sense at the blue line.\n\nThe boss doesn't even exist, and perhaps jobs don't exist at all either, through that hopscotch portal.\n\nMaybe it's the world of \"My Little Ponies\", since those hopscotch witches were only 6.\n\nIn the world of little ponies candy is free, and everyone is loved.\n\nSo thinking about the boss is a big pull away from that.\n\nSilence thus makes my argument simpler, because you don't need much to pick up an intent trail when you are absolutely empty of thoughts or desires.\n\nOr another analogy.  You have an old sock of a missing woman, and the world's best hound dog.\n\nThat dog can sniff out anything!\n\nExcept you have your lunch in a bag.  A giant porterloin steak!\n\nYou reach down to let the dog smell the sock so he can pick up the trail of the missing woman, but all he can smell is meaty heaven.\n\nHe's just not going to be able to do it, and probably not even for the rest of the day, until he forgets about the steak in the paper bag.\n\nIn perfect silence, you are face to face with all the \"intent trails\" ever left by any humans.\n\nSo how much \"scent\" do you need to follow one, if you are \"blank\"?\n\nIf you aren't causing any unwanted emanations to glow, through your own stray motivations.\n\nI doubt one emanation's \"scent\" is enough.\n\nThe emanations radiate \"feelings\" when awareness flows into them.\n\nBut they're micro feelings.  Or even pico feelings.\n\nVery tiny, and meaningless by themselves.\n\nYou need a lot more than 1, to have any \"meaning\".\n\nI have no idea how many, but \"loincloth\" is a gigantic amount of glowing emanations!\n\nSo it counts in finding the trail of past intent.\n\nCarlos warned us over and over.  \"The Intent of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico!\"\n\nHopefully I can cut to the conclusion and it'll make sense.\n\nWhen someone asks, \"Can I use my superpowers to help the police?\"\n\nThe answer is not, \"You rat bastard!  What kind of needy attention seeking motivation is that???!!\"\n\nThe true answer is, \"Did the Olmecs have police investigators?  Didn't they just cut off the heads of anyone suspected of anything at all, at the whim of their king?\"\n\nIf they didn't have police investigations, then no.  You can't learn sorcery if  you want to help the police.\n\nBecause that's a different trail of emanations.\n\nYou have to copy as much as you can of what they did, even if its as silly as a loincloth, in order to pick up the latent awareness flowing on the emanations.\n\nSo that particular \"bundle\" of emanations will feel enough glow from your awareness to \"re skim\" that path, and not the infinite number of other possible realities contained at your current position of the assemblage point.\n\nIf you were trying to literally \"catch a train\" as it went by, throwing a little hook with a string at it, trying to snag a rail or get the hook caught on something so it would yank you up onto the moving train, a single string with a single hook is not enough to pull your bloated body.\n\nBut 100 hooks could do it.\n\nWe're trying to \"catch a free ride\" on the Olmec Seer express.\n\nDoesn't matter if it's no longer around.\n\nIt still exists, and always will, in the traces of past awareness which flowed through the emanations.\n\nThat's why Silent Knowledge exists!  As crazy as this all sounds, Carlos warned us about it specifically.  So we'd have no doubts when we \"picked up the scent\".\n\nI don't have to worry if what I post is too nutty to be taken seriously.\n\nI can just say, \"Blame Carlos.  He's the one who told us what to pursue.\"\n\nI'm sort of hoping to tell a new person ,  that since the Olmec had no policemen, a motivation of helping the police won't work to learn sorcery.  And maybe that explanation will go down better than my \"You rat bastard!\" approach.\n\nFor animations.  Those need to be as non-confrontational as possible, so they work for a very long time.\n\nAnd a very simple explanation is that you have to copy as much as possible, and not add anything of your own. Even if it seems that's irrelevant.\n\nBecause it's just the latent glow of awareness on tiny little emanations.  With \"meanings\" so small, you can't even put them into words.\n\nWe need to hook to as many of those as possible, until they \"pull\" us as an entire unit.\n\nA very specific \"bundle\" created over thousand of years by the Olmecs alone.\n\nImpossible to get from any other source.\n\nIn that sense, \"intent\" could be defined as the number of emanations which must glow, in order to have \"meaning\".\n\nOne emanation, is very specific.  But it's not enough to describe in words.\n\nIt takes zillions to have meaning.\n\nAnd to get pulled by something as complex as \"sorcery\", you have to match as much of what the old seers did as you possibly can.\n\nAnd be silent so you don't light up stray emanations not used by them, by focusing your awareness on your own memories of other things.\n\nSo there's two \"darkroom events\" than caused me to realize this.\n\nOne was Cholita, who did an imitation of a statue for me.\n\nNo reason.\n\nShe just \"does stuff\".\n\nI came home, she was standing where I couldn't avoid her, not speaking, but she approached until she was just a foot or two away.\n\nAnd froze motionless.\n\nIt was really weird.\n\nNothing moved.  Not even a hair.\n\nAnd she invited me with the glint in her eyes, to look closely.\n\nBut I finally had to give up, because she just wasn't going to move or speak.\n\nThen that night while doing darkroom, I found myself face to face with a series of statues.\n\nWhich were absolutely stable and unchanging.  Nothing phantom or ghostlike about them.  If I stared, nothing changed.  They didn't mutate or turn into something else, even if I looked too hard.\n\nThey were \"more\" than just a dream. More even than a waking dreaming.\n\nAnd an entire phantom room formed around them, with people high up in the \"viewing gallery\", looking down at the statues.\n\nMe sitting on a bench in front of a particular one of the 4 present.\n\nI gazed at each so long, because of the absolute novelty of something that real which couldn't possibly exist.  So that after a while reality reskimmed, and I was sitting in front of the next one.\n\nUntil i saw each of the 4 upclose.  Without having to walk over to them.\n\nThey just came to me, no more than two feet away.\n\nAs Cholita had done.\n\nShe \"lit up enough emanations\" of statues, and viewing statues, and how they don't move even a tiny bit, just by doing an imitation of that for me.\n\nLike one of those guys in New York who paints his clothes and skin silver, and poses on the side of a busy walkway hoping people will be so impressed by his ability not to move, they'll put some money in the little can at his feet.\n\nCholita showed me the \"doing of statues\", and in the deep levels of silence I can reach it was more of a glow than any other selection of emanations.\n\nAnd so I picked up the intent trail of \"The Hall of Statues\".\n\nCarol Tiggs did a similar thing for me in private classes, when Carlos brought her in to \"show us some magic\".\n\nShe didn't do any complicated movement.  Didn't chant, or wave her hands.\n\nShe just had me sit on the floor, put her hands on my shoulders, and lowered me back.\n\nAnd I fell into one of heer favorite places, from the stories about her we've hard.\n\nOne of the tunnels in the inorganic being's realm.  Maybe because the death defier spent so much time in one.\n\nSorcery works like that!  It's few on procedures and rituals if you follow \"the new seers\".\n\nBut it works, because reality is just a collection of glowing emanations.\n\nIt's an \"amoral\" structure.  Why doesn't matter.  Just \"what was\" before.\n\nThe other incident was when I was doing the Stellar Hatch pass, and clearly saw Fancy's face down on the floor.\n\nYou gaze down to find a ball of light 2 stories down, then project it into space and bring it back.\n\nYour awareness travels all the way to the nearest star in \"line of sight\", the star is curious and adds its own awareness to the puff, and back it comes.\n\nFancy came back, but she was looking really odd.\n\nI said, \"Is that you Fancy, or is some sun trying to copy our look?  Is something as alien as a whole sun, interested in what it's like to be a human creature on earth?\"\n\nFancy said, \"That's why it's fun!  We get to be like you for a while. Wouldn't you eagerly do the same, to be one of us for a while, living in our world quite naturally?\"\n\nI gazed into the weird version of her wondering how much was my ally \"Fancy\", and how much a gigantic sun.\n\nThe imaged changed to that of a sun, as shown by one of those corona cameras.  Where the intense glow in the middle, too bright to see because it will burn your eyes, has been reduced to manageable levels.\n\nAnd the corona was clearly visible on it, down by my floor,  like a lion's mane.\n\nIt was a \"face\" too!  A really cool sight.\n\nFancy suggested, \"Maybe that's how they see themselves!  Not so different after all, are we?\"\n\nShe proceeded to explain how to create an alternate reality you can physically enter, through animations people watch.\n\nPointing out, God himself was created by the prayers of all humans.\n\nHe's there!  Mystics throughout the ages have visited him for real, and completely misunderstood what he is.\n\nHe's a gigantic bundle of emanations glowing with latent awareness, just because so many prayed to him, thinking about his \"divine nature\".\n\nAs a result, he's now considered, \"the mold of man\".\n\nLikewise, if there's a virtual Dance Home series of animations people watch, they light up the emanations on that place, and in silence you can literally go visit.\n\nThe more who watch that, the easier it gets.\n\nAt first, a few witches will dream of it.  In such a way that it seems normal.\n\nThey just saw it too much, so it shows up in a dream.\n\nJust like that bad hotdog you got at the park which made you puke, is sure to show up in a dream again.\n\nExcept if you have 10 witches who saw the same phantom copy of Dance Home, you've just done precisely what the Olmec did, to create a new phantom realm.\n\nAs the death defier did for Tula.\n\nYou have multiple people, dreaming of the same objects.\n\nThat's the very method used by the Olmecs to make phantom worlds.\n\nSo yes, animations can do that.  Of course they can!\n\nAnd with characters that are interesting in the animations, with their own unique personalities, you hook to the intent of the new seers.\n\nTo lineages.\n\nYou can literally make a \"virtual lineage\", with the beings in the lineage being \"Silent Knowledge Entities\", created by the cartoons.\n\nWhat everyone has been wanting.

But I can&amp;#39;t afford the time.  I have to finish my copy of the moth from the books, but able to fly for real in a virtual 3D Dance Home.  And land on a water cooler to make it burp.  Something &amp;quot;Little Smoke&amp;quot; did for the classes of Carlos, just before he released her to help us out. And maybe did again for Jadey, at the end of her Affection pass video.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I saw was followed by the most amazing set of insights on how to make the best progress learning sorcery that you possibly can.  And why some who come here can never learn it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It started when I did my first long form in a series of perhaps 5 that I use to create bubble station. A phantom room which I believe can hook me to a much older form of sorcery.  Not that it&amp;#39;s important to do that, but it&amp;#39;s very intriguing and makes a good hobby that helps keep my practice very consistent from day to day, so that intent can store into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a simple way to understand why routines are good during darkroom, even though we&amp;#39;re supposed to disrupt them during the day.  As part of the &amp;quot;warrior&amp;#39;s way&amp;quot; point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the day you&amp;#39;re stuck in the river of shit.  The blue line on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The routines there, keep you at that position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So disrupting them breaks some ties, and makes it slightly easier to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But darkroom isn&amp;#39;t at the blue line.  The intent is to keep moving the assemblage point, so as to see more and more cool stuff.  Stuff that only gets cooler, if the assemblage point moves along that entire path.  So making that a routine is a positive thing, because it&amp;#39;s a routine with the intent to escape the blue line on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which gets us to the goal Carlos gave us.  &amp;quot;Seeing&amp;quot;.  Or as he decided to rename it, so we wouldn&amp;#39;t make up a pretend version of what it is, &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get silent, knowledge flows to you.  If you aren&amp;#39;t, it doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now already, that statement implies a wrong point of view.  That&amp;#39;s what I got to see tonight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a game little girls play where they draw squares on the sidewalk using chalk, and then hop and jump through the path they create, to land at the end.  Then they jump up to turn around, and go back.  There&amp;#39;s some bean bag tossing as I recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose I can just find a picture of that for the post, and save time so I can continue to learn to animate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s say a nasty old witch decided she had to replace herself.  She was getting to the end of her life.  And didn&amp;#39;t want there to be 1 less nasty old witch in the world, because in fact it&amp;#39;s very rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she pretended to be a kindly old woman living next door to the girls who play &amp;quot;hopscotch&amp;quot;, and somehow managed to turn it into a powerful form of witchcraft for the children to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe because they&amp;#39;re little kids, that wasn&amp;#39;t even difficult.  Kids will believe anything an adult tells them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the little girls could literally play their hopscotch game,  at the end of a successful round a doorway opens up, and they get to visit a new world.  For real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The neighbor little boys didn&amp;#39;t like to hear they could do that, and insisted they had to &amp;quot;prove it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let the boys watch, and see them vanish at the end of a round.  Presumably because they stepped through an invisible doorway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the girls refused.  The witch had trained them well.  NEVER show magic to outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita got a lesson on that, but I have no idea from whom.  She once flaunted the laws of physics right in my face, after a drink or two over dinner.  When I made a big fuss, she never went out to eat with me again. It&amp;#39;s been at least a year now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The boys, frustrated, tried to do it themselves.  But it never worked.  And the key to why not, is that weren&amp;#39;t  doing what the little girls were doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though they cell phone recorded it and copied it perfectly, it still didn&amp;#39;t do anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they gave up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a new little girl moved into the neighborhood, and the junior witches taught her to play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she had the precise same motivations the little witches had. I really couldn&amp;#39;t explain what it was, because I&amp;#39;m on the little boys&amp;#39; side.  Trying to break it apart and analyze it, while visualizing how cool it will be when I can vanish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can I do that at a boring assembly at school with the principle going on and on about the need to put your trays away in the cafeteria, to save work for the servers?  And as a junior &amp;quot;political statement&amp;quot;, just vanish in front of the entire audience to show my boredom with the assembly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it could land a TV show interview!  &amp;quot;How to Vanish!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clearly the motivation of the little boys, was not the same as that of the little girls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They actually just liked socializing, and the game gave them a formal structure in which to do that, with fun rewards while they played the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they repeated it daily, it became a &amp;quot;container for fun&amp;quot;.  For &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; to store into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they&amp;#39;re just kids who don&amp;#39;t know any better,  not realizing magic is a big deal, vanishing is not nearly as important to them as having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there you have the problem with sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all just emanations out there!  And our awareness flowing on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s absolutely no  morals to that.  No better or worse.  Nothing to guide what works and what doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It only seems to be that way, because we&amp;#39;re following fixed paths in the emanations created by others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As it was, so shall it be again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An old bible saying, reworded often by scholars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing more.  When you start thinking what&amp;#39;s going on is &amp;quot;karma&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;God&amp;#39;s plan for each of us&amp;quot;, and want to think and fuss and try to behave the best you can to fit into that, you&amp;#39;re not understanding sorcery at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fall into that trap easily, because I find myself in an endless battle with bad men wanting to steal from our community with pretend magic.  They&amp;#39;ve buried the real thing so deep no one could find it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it all boils down to &amp;quot;hopscotch&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hopscotch witchcraft does NOT work based on the moves, or the jumps or number of squares or how you turn around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It works because it worked before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just what it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it only does that, if you play the very same game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which includes why you are playing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The boys were not playing the  same game at all.  Their game was about something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to say &amp;quot;attention seeking&amp;quot;, because that&amp;#39;s the judgemental way to look at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just simply were not playing the way little girls play it.  Little girls don&amp;#39;t really even care who wins, as long as everyone has a good time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll even change the rules if someone is losing too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And doing that, they carved a path through the emanations, leaving a trail forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A trail of &amp;quot;hopscotch witchcraft&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little girl on the other side of the world might accidentally pick up that trail, and find it pulls her to the same final effect.  A doorway opens up and she can leave this world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just matters how much of what the little witches did while playing their game, that she accidentally copies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re in the same boat!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to accuse people who don&amp;#39;t have the same motivations as the old or new seers, as being &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad players.  I mean to say, someone who plays a game, but is motivated by something else.  Not the game at all.  But they pretend to want to play the game, to get the support of the whole team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe they just want the free Gatorade the coach provides, and have a crush on his wife.  So they hang around, and it makes things worse for those who are serious about playing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a true point of view!  Those are indeed, &amp;quot;bad players&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it misses the point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Olmecs had certain motivations for doing what they did.  And those are as much of a part of the magic, as everything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all just traces in the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s impossible to find such a distant and odd combination of emanations, required to do what the Olmecs could do, without the pull of the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without somehow tapping into their own &amp;quot;hopscotch&amp;quot; game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not just procedurally.  It even has to copy their attitude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when someone comes to the subreddit asking if they can &amp;quot;help the police&amp;quot; with the super powers they&amp;#39;ll gain through sorcery, I&amp;#39;m inclined to say, &amp;quot;Absolutely not!  That&amp;#39;s a greedy motivation not worthy of the lofty goals of seers!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if to be a seer you had to be noble, and deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, totally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And hopefully I catch myself and explain, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s so hard to learn to get silent, with that motivation you&amp;#39;ll give up.  You aren&amp;#39;t interested in magic, it&amp;#39;s something else you want.  And you&amp;#39;ll soon realize you can&amp;#39;t easily get it with sorcery.  It takes too long.  So you&amp;#39;ll go get whatever you really wanted, somewhere else that&amp;#39;s easier.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s true too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it misses the point.  It&amp;#39;s still smelling of being a moralist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the witches were fond of saying, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re not moral or immoral. We&amp;#39;re &amp;#39;amoral&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always misunderstood that to be an excuse for lesbian sex orgies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was always a hint of that sort of thing going on in Cleargreen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I just hoped there was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t recall clearly after so long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I really did misunderstand that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to point to what I&amp;#39;m saying here, more important to learning sorcery is, how do you look in a loincloth?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because in fact, the old seers wore loincloths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which seems to have absolutely nothing to do with sorcery until you realize, it&amp;#39;s just a &amp;quot;bundle of emanations&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a past that can repeat because, &amp;quot;As it was, so shall it be again&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it is from perfect silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can be done in imperfect silence, but in perfect silence you aren&amp;#39;t thinking about stuff that lights up emanations not wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worry about the boss and his bad view of your job performance, only makes sense at the blue line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The boss doesn&amp;#39;t even exist, and perhaps jobs don&amp;#39;t exist at all either, through that hopscotch portal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s the world of &amp;quot;My Little Ponies&amp;quot;, since those hopscotch witches were only 6.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the world of little ponies candy is free, and everyone is loved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So thinking about the boss is a big pull away from that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence thus makes my argument simpler, because you don&amp;#39;t need much to pick up an intent trail when you are absolutely empty of thoughts or desires.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or another analogy.  You have an old sock of a missing woman, and the world&amp;#39;s best hound dog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That dog can sniff out anything!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except you have your lunch in a bag.  A giant porterloin steak!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You reach down to let the dog smell the sock so he can pick up the trail of the missing woman, but all he can smell is meaty heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s just not going to be able to do it, and probably not even for the rest of the day, until he forgets about the steak in the paper bag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In perfect silence, you are face to face with all the &amp;quot;intent trails&amp;quot; ever left by any humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how much &amp;quot;scent&amp;quot; do you need to follow one, if you are &amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you aren&amp;#39;t causing any unwanted emanations to glow, through your own stray motivations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I doubt one emanation&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;scent&amp;quot; is enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emanations radiate &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot; when awareness flows into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;re micro feelings.  Or even pico feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very tiny, and meaningless by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need a lot more than 1, to have any &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how many, but &amp;quot;loincloth&amp;quot; is a gigantic amount of glowing emanations!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it counts in finding the trail of past intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos warned us over and over.  &amp;quot;The Intent of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I can cut to the conclusion and it&amp;#39;ll make sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When someone asks, &amp;quot;Can I use my superpowers to help the police?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer is not, &amp;quot;You rat bastard!  What kind of needy attention seeking motivation is that???!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The true answer is, &amp;quot;Did the Olmecs have police investigators?  Didn&amp;#39;t they just cut off the heads of anyone suspected of anything at all, at the whim of their king?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they didn&amp;#39;t have police investigations, then no.  You can&amp;#39;t learn sorcery if  you want to help the police.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because that&amp;#39;s a different trail of emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to copy as much as you can of what they did, even if its as silly as a loincloth, in order to pick up the latent awareness flowing on the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that particular &amp;quot;bundle&amp;quot; of emanations will feel enough glow from your awareness to &amp;quot;re skim&amp;quot; that path, and not the infinite number of other possible realities contained at your current position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you were trying to literally &amp;quot;catch a train&amp;quot; as it went by, throwing a little hook with a string at it, trying to snag a rail or get the hook caught on something so it would yank you up onto the moving train, a single string with a single hook is not enough to pull your bloated body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But 100 hooks could do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re trying to &amp;quot;catch a free ride&amp;quot; on the Olmec Seer express.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s no longer around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It still exists, and always will, in the traces of past awareness which flowed through the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why Silent Knowledge exists!  As crazy as this all sounds, Carlos warned us about it specifically.  So we&amp;#39;d have no doubts when we &amp;quot;picked up the scent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have to worry if what I post is too nutty to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can just say, &amp;quot;Blame Carlos.  He&amp;#39;s the one who told us what to pursue.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sort of hoping to tell a new person ,  that since the Olmec had no policemen, a motivation of helping the police won&amp;#39;t work to learn sorcery.  And maybe that explanation will go down better than my &amp;quot;You rat bastard!&amp;quot; approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For animations.  Those need to be as non-confrontational as possible, so they work for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a very simple explanation is that you have to copy as much as possible, and not add anything of your own. Even if it seems that&amp;#39;s irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s just the latent glow of awareness on tiny little emanations.  With &amp;quot;meanings&amp;quot; so small, you can&amp;#39;t even put them into words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to hook to as many of those as possible, until they &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; us as an entire unit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very specific &amp;quot;bundle&amp;quot; created over thousand of years by the Olmecs alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Impossible to get from any other source.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that sense, &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; could be defined as the number of emanations which must glow, in order to have &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One emanation, is very specific.  But it&amp;#39;s not enough to describe in words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes zillions to have meaning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to get pulled by something as complex as &amp;quot;sorcery&amp;quot;, you have to match as much of what the old seers did as you possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And be silent so you don&amp;#39;t light up stray emanations not used by them, by focusing your awareness on your own memories of other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s two &amp;quot;darkroom events&amp;quot; than caused me to realize this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One was Cholita, who did an imitation of a statue for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She just &amp;quot;does stuff&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came home, she was standing where I couldn&amp;#39;t avoid her, not speaking, but she approached until she was just a foot or two away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And froze motionless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was really weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing moved.  Not even a hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she invited me with the glint in her eyes, to look closely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I finally had to give up, because she just wasn&amp;#39;t going to move or speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then that night while doing darkroom, I found myself face to face with a series of statues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which were absolutely stable and unchanging.  Nothing phantom or ghostlike about them.  If I stared, nothing changed.  They didn&amp;#39;t mutate or turn into something else, even if I looked too hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were &amp;quot;more&amp;quot; than just a dream. More even than a waking dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And an entire phantom room formed around them, with people high up in the &amp;quot;viewing gallery&amp;quot;, looking down at the statues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me sitting on a bench in front of a particular one of the 4 present.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed at each so long, because of the absolute novelty of something that real which couldn&amp;#39;t possibly exist.  So that after a while reality reskimmed, and I was sitting in front of the next one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until i saw each of the 4 upclose.  Without having to walk over to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just came to me, no more than two feet away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Cholita had done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She &amp;quot;lit up enough emanations&amp;quot; of statues, and viewing statues, and how they don&amp;#39;t move even a tiny bit, just by doing an imitation of that for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like one of those guys in New York who paints his clothes and skin silver, and poses on the side of a busy walkway hoping people will be so impressed by his ability not to move, they&amp;#39;ll put some money in the little can at his feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita showed me the &amp;quot;doing of statues&amp;quot;, and in the deep levels of silence I can reach it was more of a glow than any other selection of emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so I picked up the intent trail of &amp;quot;The Hall of Statues&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol Tiggs did a similar thing for me in private classes, when Carlos brought her in to &amp;quot;show us some magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t do any complicated movement.  Didn&amp;#39;t chant, or wave her hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She just had me sit on the floor, put her hands on my shoulders, and lowered me back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I fell into one of heer favorite places, from the stories about her we&amp;#39;ve hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the tunnels in the inorganic being&amp;#39;s realm.  Maybe because the death defier spent so much time in one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery works like that!  It&amp;#39;s few on procedures and rituals if you follow &amp;quot;the new seers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it works, because reality is just a collection of glowing emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an &amp;quot;amoral&amp;quot; structure.  Why doesn&amp;#39;t matter.  Just &amp;quot;what was&amp;quot; before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other incident was when I was doing the Stellar Hatch pass, and clearly saw Fancy&amp;#39;s face down on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You gaze down to find a ball of light 2 stories down, then project it into space and bring it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your awareness travels all the way to the nearest star in &amp;quot;line of sight&amp;quot;, the star is curious and adds its own awareness to the puff, and back it comes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy came back, but she was looking really odd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said, &amp;quot;Is that you Fancy, or is some sun trying to copy our look?  Is something as alien as a whole sun, interested in what it&amp;#39;s like to be a human creature on earth?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s fun!  We get to be like you for a while. Wouldn&amp;#39;t you eagerly do the same, to be one of us for a while, living in our world quite naturally?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed into the weird version of her wondering how much was my ally &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot;, and how much a gigantic sun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The imaged changed to that of a sun, as shown by one of those corona cameras.  Where the intense glow in the middle, too bright to see because it will burn your eyes, has been reduced to manageable levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the corona was clearly visible on it, down by my floor,  like a lion&amp;#39;s mane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a &amp;quot;face&amp;quot; too!  A really cool sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy suggested, &amp;quot;Maybe that&amp;#39;s how they see themselves!  Not so different after all, are we?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She proceeded to explain how to create an alternate reality you can physically enter, through animations people watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pointing out, God himself was created by the prayers of all humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s there!  Mystics throughout the ages have visited him for real, and completely misunderstood what he is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s a gigantic bundle of emanations glowing with latent awareness, just because so many prayed to him, thinking about his &amp;quot;divine nature&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, he&amp;#39;s now considered, &amp;quot;the mold of man&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, if there&amp;#39;s a virtual Dance Home series of animations people watch, they light up the emanations on that place, and in silence you can literally go visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more who watch that, the easier it gets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, a few witches will dream of it.  In such a way that it seems normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just saw it too much, so it shows up in a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like that bad hotdog you got at the park which made you puke, is sure to show up in a dream again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except if you have 10 witches who saw the same phantom copy of Dance Home, you&amp;#39;ve just done precisely what the Olmec did, to create a new phantom realm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the death defier did for Tula.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have multiple people, dreaming of the same objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the very method used by the Olmecs to make phantom worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yes, animations can do that.  Of course they can!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with characters that are interesting in the animations, with their own unique personalities, you hook to the intent of the new seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To lineages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can literally make a &amp;quot;virtual lineage&amp;quot;, with the beings in the lineage being &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge Entities&amp;quot;, created by the cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What everyone has been wanting.

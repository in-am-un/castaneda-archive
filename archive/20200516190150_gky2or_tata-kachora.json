To star in a movie.  Use Kachora&amp;#39;s voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect he&amp;#39;s dying, and his minions want power. If there&amp;#39;s nothing left because people finally see how evil Kachora was, what will they have?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks like over the years, his followers have done serious damage to the Castaneda community with their delusional belief in the first few books as being all you need, and  that magic was made up by Carlos to fill later books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And example:  A kachora follower was going on about inventory warrior items, like &amp;quot;affirmations from the world around us&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d probably been mentally masturbating on that idea for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he found out it was Little Smoke that made the teapot gurgle, he became enraged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though, Carlos did that for us in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And recently, Jadey caught her doing it again, while video taping a tensegrity pass for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jadey also said, Kachora had sucked in people she knew, women, who enjoyed being able to say, &amp;quot;I have a benefactor&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kachora followers tend to hide that he claims to be don Juan, because they know that will bring hell down on them.

Of course, it is what I could get on photoshop, wich is not as WONDERFUL as seeing it  \"alive and moving\".\n\nKeep in mind this is absolutely not advanced stuff. Actually it is almost easy, and for most of them you don't even need to be full on heightened awareness.\n\nThey just need silence. TRUE silence.\n\nIf you can't find a puff of colour you have to know your internal dialogue is totally uncontrolled.\n\nYou need to hard work on that, or you will never learn sorcery.\n\nWhat you see in my house are mostly fully animated dreams proyecting on things. I guess they are all a result of a lateral shift, while I move all the way to heightened awareness.\n\nNow I almost ignore them, because I realize it takes much more time when things get crazy (lateral).\n\nTwo days ago I started practicing around 3pm on the river, and I reached full heightened awareness around 9pm, on the sunset!!\n\nToo long for me. Of course, before that I had a lot of crazy stuff to play with. But before the breath change, you are still in \"suffering mode\".\n\nMaybe I get some bliss waves, but I still feel the lack of something.\n\nOnce I get absolutely no words in head, and can rest there, I arrive paradise. For real, paradise.\n\nThe most pure happiness state you could imagine.\n\nBtw, did you notice my girl??\n\nOn the right, that adorable little character. That's Fairy, the inorganic being. While daylight gazing she just materializes into any object she likes, until it becomes 100% real and 3D.\n\nThe white rectangle is the most advanced stuff there. At that point I was stop feeling my body, and a scene appeared in front of everything in my view! The opacy gradually increased.\n\nThe second picture, that rock, I guess is \"seeing energy\", or \"reading of the wall\". It is also easy stuff. The hard part would be choosing what you want to read about? If not, it is almost random.\n\nBut still amazing. That numbers were very stable. I mean I could move and they were there. Sometimes they changed,  but always three: 242, 524, 455.\n\nI see there are lots of new members. Those who really want to learn sorcery will have to be willing to forget the inventories they bring. They are unnecessary.\n\n**Listen to Dan** !! Learn to silence the mind and absolutely everything that is in the books will make sense.\n\nRemember that the Castaneda community doesn't need people who want to attract attention.

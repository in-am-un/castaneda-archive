He's going to run there as fast as he can.\n\nAlong the way he'll miss all the wonderful sights.\n\nAnd once he has his ice-cream, he's far into the park.\n\nPerhaps near the head office building where the park is controlled.  That's one of the most boring places in the park!\n\nHe missed out on the friendly bees, sampling the pollen on the amazing flowers near the entrance.\n\nHe even missed the huge swimming pool in the middle, filled with curious people.\n\nAll he can think about is the soothing comfort of that treat.\n\nYou'd think that running like that gets him to the control center faster, but in fact, this park is in the second attention.\n\nThe \"twilight zone\", where time and space have less meaning.\n\nAs he runs towards his goal, the park walkways stretch.  The faster he runs, the further away they are.\n\nHe'll still get there, but it'll take 2 hours.\n\nOn the other hand, he can stop near the entrance, and feel those amazing flowers with his hands.\n\nThe more he wiggles his fingers in those flowers, with the peaceful, well fed bees flitting all around,  the shorter that path to the control center becomes.\n\nIf he also gazes deeply into them, he might find he's already been transported there.\n\nTo heightened awareness.\n\nIn half the time.\n\nIn this particular case, I was trying to assemble a view of my luminous body. The one that Zuleica's technique makes stronger.\n\nIt's a peculiar sight.  You can clearly see it.  It's as obvious as it is in this picture.\n\nBut I have to remind you, this is just stuff I grabbed on the web. The real thing is much more complicated, and ethereal.\n\nAnd, you won't believe it.  Even while looking right at it, you feel that there's nothing really there.\n\nI suppose, it's a view banned by Mr. DoubleTake.\n\nHe can't stop you anymore.\n\nBut he can make you doubt it.  So that you take no joy in the sight.\n\nIf you gaze at it anyway, while wiggling your fingers on the assemblage point of the second attention, the concentration of your gaze on a specific point produces a disruption in the surrounding area.\n\nSince it's a pitch black room, there's really nothing to see in the surrounding area which isn't actually a manifestation of the second attention.\n\nThat's the value of a pitch black room.  You know for sure, anything you see is magic.\n\nAnd magic can condense into a visible manifestation of *intent*.\n\nIt's like a mini-horizon of energy, just waiting for you to notice what it might be.\n\nIf you ignore that, it selects a result for you.\n\nI have no idea how.\n\nBut a blue pitcher dropped out from the little cloud last night. Fell right onto the bedspread, in front of my feet.\n\nIt wasn't a ghost-like object.\n\nIt was a real pitcher.\n\nCould have been an echo of Fancy's pitchers.  \"Fancy\" is an inorganic being I found only a week or two ago, to make up for the loss of \"Fairy\" (Little Smoke).  She's off helping others.\n\nFancy is an unknown entity.  Not tested in any lineage of sorcerers.\n\nShe used pitchers last week to trap me in abstract dreaming, so she could gain more energy from me.\n\nI posted a pic of it.\n\nFancy is a bad girl!  A short while later, she even tried to trap me with more objects.  This time it was torn green rag shreds. They were intoxicating to look at, because it was clear they were alive.  She had them in a little wooden box, which I didn't bother to show in the picture.\n\nShe probably wanted me to obsess over counting them.  That's one of her tricks, to activate the list keeping mind set.  The list keeper can be triggered by the Eagle's command to take an inventory.\n\nIf the sight is hypnotic, you can get stuck there for hours. Always checking the count to make sure nothing has been lost.\n\nThey're the ideal inventory you can take, in response to the command from the Eagle.\n\nBut I ignored them, and they hung out only a few minutes more.  They became vaguer and vaguer as each minute passed.\n\nEven that was unusual.  Something ignored usually goes away in seconds.\n\nAs I looked at the blue pitcher which fell at my feet, I realized an extremely deep level of silence could even summon the *intent* disruptions all by itself.  I could feel that in the disruption. It was enhanced by silence.\n\nImagine living in that level of silence all the time!  Objects would be falling from the trees all around you.\n\nPerhaps it wasn't the gaze itself that summoned the intent disruption, but rather the silence achieved when the gaze is focused on something you can visibly see, which can't possibly exist.\n\nWhichever causes it, the silence becomes so intense you can literally feel that little flurry of colored lights, which marks the *intent* disruption.\n\nYou get an odd tingling sensation in your stomach, as if you were gently falling. Perhaps like an elevator.  Or maybe it's like being in love and having butterflies in your stomach.\n\nMinus the social implications...\n\nWhen the falling feeling stops, you notice you have an object in your hand.\n\nA spice bottle.\n\nExcept, the spices were green last night.  And while I believe it had no lid, it's such an odd sight you forget to check.\n\nI actually tossed the spice bottle to the left, to get it out of my hand.  I hadn't picked it up, and it was interfering with my wiggling fingers.\n\nA little metal tin appeared next.  I could actually move it around with my hands, as if it were real.\n\nIt almost seems as if Fancy didn't like me learning to move my energy body, and was tossing me little trinkets which filled my hands, in order to stop me.\n\nI looked inside the metal tin. It was empty.  Seemed to be made of some metal I'd never seen before.  Silvery, but not very shiny.\n\nBut I felt nothing.  No mass, no heat or cold.\n\nThat would take moving further to the right or left, at that position of the assemblage point.\n\nMy best guess:\n\n1). Non-directional things means, not much dreaming double in use. It's all \"you\".  Congratulations!  It's not easy to see that sort of thing, even if it feels imaginary.\n\n2). Directional sights mean, your dreaming body got curious and is  helping you out.  But it's still standing behind you, only lending its eyes.\n\n3). Solid objects means, you're in dreaming. You left the real room.  It might look the same, but at this point you could walk right through the bedroom wall.  Your Tonal is riding in the Nagual.\n\nBut that's all speculation for now.\n\nThe goal of Zuleica's technique is to allow you to merge the dreaming body with the waking body, so you can switch back and forth, as described in Eagle's Gift.\n\nOnce you can do that, you are beyond the reach of the inorganic beings.\n\nBut Zuleica's technique requires heightened awareness.\n\nSo we've added Tensegrity to help. That was the idea Carlos had. Give us tensegrity, to move our assemblage points.\n\nYou scoop the colors that Zuleica promised you would see, in darkness.\n\nAnd as she said, you pull them closer to yourself.  You \"redeploy\" them, similar to \"Unbending Intent, long form\":\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273\\_PU&amp;t=5m22s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;t=5m22s)\n\nSupposedly Zuleica's technique leads to the results Carlos had where you fold in half, and end up in a ditch.\n\nExcept, if you read that story well, you realize Carlos put hundreds of hours into his wiggling. Over many, many days.\n\nBut we came there the long way.  We have to put ourselves into heightened awareness, at the start of our practice session.\n\nAnd yet, our method might end up being shorter than what Carlos did.\n\nDon  Juan did all the work for him, and put him into heightened awareness first.\n\nAnd then Zuleica became his \"motivator\".  She even used threats of violence to keep him working in the dark.\n\nWe have to do both of those ourselves. Get to heightened awareness, and find the motivation.\n\nWhile we are at each position of the assemblage point, watching closely, our dreaming double will get curious.\n\nIt becomes our assistant.\n\nIt's an unexpected result of going this path.\n\nMore control.\n\nEdited five times\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Intent Disruptions", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "link_ids": ["t3_ifu1bv", "t3_if5koq", "t3_ienqgj", "t3_ie01zd", "t3_idn0fa", "t3_idh7ju", "t3_iczlw5", "t3_icv2ot", "t3_irms6p", "t3_irglig", "t3_iqzit7", "t3_iq7jdg", "t3_iof5ib", "t3_invu3w", "t3_imlozg", "t3_ilzfhg", "t3_ildkri", "t3_ijgd33", "t3_iixdqk", "t3_ihms98", "t3_ih21eh", "t3_ih44uo", "t3_igh7ta", "t3_igday4", "t3_jcxlwj", "t3_hp41du", "t3_kdsew2", "t3_kz7y8a", "t3_kz75ql", "t3_kw4lpr", "t3_kvqj52", "t3_knpzzc", "t3_km2pzf", "t3_kj29l8", "t3_kd0b1h", "t3_k641wo", "t3_k4jrfq", "t3_k2paj7", "t3_k2dn7a", "t3_k1fwwj", "t3_jqlctf", "t3_jq09jk", "t3_jp4g2x", "t3_jng0bx", "t3_jmu5w3", "t3_jmsrw3", "t3_jm1fxl", "t3_jkklgr", "t3_jikxdd", "t3_jhb6f9", "t3_jh8142", "t3_jglh8m", "t3_jgb5mx", "t3_jg53re", "t3_jfoaai", "t3_jf4c1u", "t3_je4gyw", "t3_jdlcth", "t3_jby6ff", "t3_jadwdo", "t3_j9fkih", "t3_j96xwg", "t3_j8rmcm", "t3_j7c8fa", "t3_j65s10", "t3_j61w6p", "t3_j43yai", "t3_j40bem", "t3_j3eykq", "t3_j2jxyx", "t3_j261xv", "t3_j1vngl", "t3_j0g2nl", "t3_izm9cx", "t3_iyhkny", "t3_ix9ipe", "t3_ix5a4g", "t3_iw29ja", "t3_iverkv", "t3_iu3yxd", "t3_isv81g", "t3_isnn0y", "t3_ic1ppo", "t3_i9fbj8", "t3_i8kcue", "t3_i795h6", "t3_i5o2m4", "t3_i4tqjj", "t3_i3o4mq", "t3_i2ha3h", "t3_i1ch4u", "t3_i0s7jm", "t3_hzfk4m", "t3_hx8xej", "t3_iyz5md", "t3_ljjdbn", "t3_lfo0wa", "t3_lgzmsv"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 1", "created_at_utc": 1598295005.319, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1620558726.961, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"s3xxtlk858j51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s3xxtlk858j51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a62e2ead375fe007ca167cf169b9c2155dbf86d0"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s3xxtlk858j51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33e44f3d4b520295fc7b0e4c0085bf5ed1ee7223"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s3xxtlk858j51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc3fc674dd0fa56c552dd857cddf7000397f9de1"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s3xxtlk858j51.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=556a602b266d028b6df37c86622ef105d51c7c8f"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s3xxtlk858j51.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2cf0a5a0ff8532345c11e14fb452f3532c62967"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s3xxtlk858j51.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=475faf51b2a15cde1df4ffb76061df09f3449f42"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s3xxtlk858j51.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03251d040104022a4930d2de7d784b0b457d92d2"}, "id": "s3xxtlk858j51"}}, "name": "t3_igh7ta", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 14, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?start=322&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

Or maybe it&amp;#39;s like being in love and having butterflies in your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minus the social implications...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the falling feeling stops, you notice you have an object in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A spice bottle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, the spices were green last night.  And while I believe it had no lid, it&amp;#39;s such an odd sight you forget to check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually tossed the spice bottle to the left, to get it out of my hand.  I hadn&amp;#39;t picked it up, and it was interfering with my wiggling fingers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little metal tin appeared next.  I could actually move it around with my hands, as if it were real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It almost seems as if Fancy didn&amp;#39;t like me learning to move my energy body, and was tossing me little trinkets which filled my hands, in order to stop me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked inside the metal tin. It was empty.  Seemed to be made of some metal I&amp;#39;d never seen before.  Silvery, but not very shiny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I felt nothing.  No mass, no heat or cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That would take moving further to the right or left, at that position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My best guess:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1). Non-directional things means, not much dreaming double in use. It&amp;#39;s all &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.  Congratulations!  It&amp;#39;s not easy to see that sort of thing, even if it feels imaginary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2). Directional sights mean, your dreaming body got curious and is  helping you out.  But it&amp;#39;s still standing behind you, only lending its eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3). Solid objects means, you&amp;#39;re in dreaming. You left the real room.  It might look the same, but at this point you could walk right through the bedroom wall.  Your Tonal is riding in the Nagual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s all speculation for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goal of Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique is to allow you to merge the dreaming body with the waking body, so you can switch back and forth, as described in Eagle&amp;#39;s Gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you can do that, you are beyond the reach of the inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique requires heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;ve added Tensegrity to help. That was the idea Carlos had. Give us tensegrity, to move our assemblage points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You scoop the colors that Zuleica promised you would see, in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as she said, you pull them closer to yourself.  You &amp;quot;redeploy&amp;quot; them, similar to &amp;quot;Unbending Intent, long form&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;amp;t=5m22s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;amp;t=5m22s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Supposedly Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique leads to the results Carlos had where you fold in half, and end up in a ditch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, if you read that story well, you realize Carlos put hundreds of hours into his wiggling. Over many, many days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we came there the long way.  We have to put ourselves into heightened awareness, at the start of our practice session.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, our method might end up being shorter than what Carlos did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don  Juan did all the work for him, and put him into heightened awareness first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then Zuleica became his &amp;quot;motivator&amp;quot;.  She even used threats of violence to keep him working in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have to do both of those ourselves. Get to heightened awareness, and find the motivation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While we are at each position of the assemblage point, watching closely, our dreaming double will get curious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It becomes our assistant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an unexpected result of going this path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited five times&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false,

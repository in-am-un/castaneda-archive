Most is done walking around just to make sure there's no chance of believing you might have dozed off for an instant.\n\nSo those of you cheating by just sitting there in the darkness \"looking for your greatness\" be warned.\n\nYou need to follow instructions. And you need to show an effort.\n\nIn fact, showing an effort is almost more important than which technique you are using.\n\nAs Carlos explained, you learn sorcery by *INTENDING* it.\n\nI'm not sure I 100% agree with that, but it's a sorcerer's point of view.\n\nThat all you need is impeccability, and to intend to follow the \"*Intent* of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico\".\n\nThe problem with that is, people have no idea what impeccability is.\n\nAnd just pretend it.\n\nSo it doesn't work at all.\n\nBut consider the time Carlos told his private class, \"Walk to San Diego\".\n\nA 110 mile walk.\n\nNo one would go.\n\nThe next day one person asked, \"What will happen if we do?\"\n\nAnd Carlos said, \"Too late. That was yesterday.\"\n\nIt was the effort he needed from us.  He wanted us to \"jump\".\n\nInfinity notices that.\n\nSo please don't make up your own version of \"darkroom\"?\n\nIt's not only not going to work, but if it did you'd regret it.  And no one in here could help you out in regards to that.\n\nNot that it would work.\n\nSuch incredible things happen while learning sorcery that you need to protect yourself from any possibility of doubt, or alternate explanations.\n\nIf you walk through a solid wall, it's very important not to be able to explain it.\n\nGiven a chance we'll explain everything \"unknown\" away. It's how we got stuck in a single reality in the first place. We were taught to gloss, and ignore, and explain away anything contrary to our fixed view of reality, as it aligns to everyone else on the planet.\n\nWe became obsessed with nothing other than gaining approval from other humans.\n\nWhich plagues this subreddit each time a beginner arrives.\n\nThey don't realize it, but people who have been here for years don't even read their posts for fear of becoming infected with \"me, me, me\".\n\nSo be careful you don't mess things up by being lazy.   As if you could get away with that, in the only place in the world with real magic.\n\nAnd certainly don't try to match what we do to any outside system. There's none with the real thing which are available to you.\n\nMight be some out there. But they certainly aren't after anyone's money, and don't want to gather more \"followers\".\n\nMagic is not pretend. If you have to close your eyes you've been tricked by con artists who just want your money.\n\nSo always follow the instructions we were given. Sorcery is real.\n\nSorcery \"disassembles\" you one part at a time.\n\nThere's no avoiding the fact that you have to remove all the foreign installations, in order to gain access to what humans were born to explore.\n\nIn the lineages, there were 15 powerful sorcerers to oversee apprentices.\n\nBut we have none.\n\nThus the instructions we have are much more important to us than in the past.\n\nBut the rewards are amazing!\n\nIn this case, you get to go back in time.\n\nFor real.\n\nBut you'll need that Tensegrity to straighten things out from time to time.\n\nOr, if you want \"safe\" you can go back to the meditation or breath work people, and resume your pretending.\n\nJust try not to give them too much of your money.\n\nCarlos always advised against wasting money, equating it to wasting something much larger.\n\nHe once warned Cholita, \"ALWAYS GET PAID!\"  Cholita got many of her clients from Carlos.  And apparently he knew she'd be taken advantage of, by some of them.\n\nUnfortunately, wasting resources is what we do all the time. We waste our limited awareness on things which only drain us of energy.\n\nUntil you save that energy back up, you won't be doing any time traveling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Silent Knowledge Audio", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"demqp8sb2i3c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/demqp8sb2i3c1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19f55450b2c514b4a699e2b62d66188e34babcdc"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/demqp8sb2i3c1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e31ccab7f1493d25ee794c3ae85f62c5f5dd5c9a"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/demqp8sb2i3c1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7abc9cb4f7e2f0ce81f0617d5a4638aa16e2aa69"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/demqp8sb2i3c1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c652594fec2be7a8524850aec3b7f254b96c645c"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/demqp8sb2i3c1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a597980bfd8ec57bff3c87e8482a30dae2531f1e"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/demqp8sb2i3c1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebacfab29c8a2621cd663557829d51567af9bc28"}], "s": {"y": 3072, "x": 3072, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/demqp8sb2i3c1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5250b848f0ad11473fdab04fb979fc929b3ec5c8"}, "id": "demqp8sb2i3c1"}}, "name": "t3_187kaq9", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 28, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 28, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Anzl9G94K91G6Drc3ZfpMkf580yBoig8M865ga7G0a8.jpg", "edited": 1701356487.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1701355807.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/demqp8sb2i3c1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5250b848f0ad11473fdab04fb979fc929b3ec5c8\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/demqp8sb2i3c1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5250b848f0ad11473fdab04fb979fc929b3ec5c8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For people new to my social media, NOTHING you see in them is done with the eyes closed.

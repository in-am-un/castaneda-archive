I think i can try to actually explain the technology of going \"further\". Quick warning, this could harm absolute beginners sinse it simplifyes and trivializes already difficult steps like forcing silence and gazing into darkness. \n\nSo first of all we have to understand what makes the AP move in the fist place. So many argue its internal silence, and i agree. But i do think is slightly more then that.\n\n Its actually \"shrinking the tonal\" which alows the AP to move really far and also to move slightly sideways (which could be needed as you get closer to the red zone).\n\nReason for that is i think that the j curve is not fully straight, but cuves slightly to the left. This actually alignes perfectly with the books because they say that the AP starts at the right shoulder blade. And in Zuelicas darkroom they where digging an energetic gap, some inches infront of the stomach, and slightly to the left. This could indicate the end destination of the AP, and be exactly where it lands. \n\nSo practically what does this mean? It means that sorcery sometimes is very difficult and we seem unable to progress past the puffs. \n\nThat is also the reason some people feel an necessity to take drugs, to move the AP. Some drugs like shooms do infact move the AP if your lucky far into the red zone, something that is extremely difficult sober. \n\nSo how can we do it sober? Its quite simple, we just have to understand how to shrink the tonal.\n\nYou see forcing silence is creating full silence for your \"inner hearing\" perception. Gazing creates \"silence\" for your vision perception and forces you to see energy puffs. Moving puff creates \"silence\" for your regular sences and forcer you to feel puffs of energy.\n\nCombining the all of these actually has a \"purpose\". Its taking away attention from the tonal (all perception of yourself and the ordinary world) so the \"nagual\" (the double) can take over. Its called \"freeing tonal energy\". Some see this even as yellow puffs in the darkroom.\n\nThis is acctually what you should have been doing in the darkroom all along, but you have been cheating and lying to yourself.\n\n I really try to make you understand how important it is to acctually do all these things. You need silence to free all \"inner hearing perception tonal energy\". Gazing \"to free all vision and recognision tonal energy\". And feeling/scooping energy to \"free all tonal sensation energy (the sensation of your body) replacing it with energetic sensation instead\".\n\nThe energy when free, joins the double energy. You can visually see this, as color puffs become brighter, and even crystalize at some point. You will also see patches of yellow and it will be usually from there that weird things happen, like seeing a whole city from above and things like that. Its because after a while there is enough  \"double energy /dreaming energy\" for fancy things like a dreeaming window into the phantom version of your own room to appear with an IOB in it. And it happens seemingly by itself. \n\nAlso quick tip, focusing of freeing tonal energy like the \"moving energy up from the feet up through the crown\" could be helpful to say the least. It fals under the \"freeing sensation energy\" branch. Transegrity can also fall under that branch if you focus on moving energy while doing it.\n\nThe \"vision\" or gazing step is acctually the easiest one in darkness, because there is nothing physical to see. Therefore some see colors without even forcing silence. This in my opinion is kinda like cheating. You have reached further on the j curve yes, but you only freed one type of tonal energy. These \"i have seen colors\" people go around and plauge the sub (sometimes) because they now think they have \"completed\" sorcery in their mind, when they did the easiest thing that we currently know of in sorcery.\n\nSo by all means keep practicing. Again we want for all tonal energy to join the double so we can \"swich\" to the double, for which you acctually don't have to fall asleep. You can make the double even seemingly replace your body, but its something that comes after stupendous amounts and quality of practice. in the end its intent that makes it work.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How to open dreaming windows (bubbles)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/b061bb3a-9e7f-4aa9-aa7a-e852027799a8", "link_ids": ["t3_ufe5n7", "t3_uqjb1b", "t3_v0blwa", "t3_vet0rc", "t3_vj02xm", "t3_vl5y3u", "t3_vljtnc", "t3_vofz7z", "t3_vskr8w", "t3_vw90yz", "t3_w06vvt", "t3_w0ef1w", "t3_w4ku1c", "t3_w69oc4", "t3_wtav5p", "t3_wzr75t", "t3_x08z4q", "t3_x394xi", "t3_x5hqin", "t3_xiqr6m", "t3_xqg5yk", "t3_yb5su0", "t3_yntpxe", "t3_yzvbf2", "t3_z29k0l", "t3_yzfldm", "t3_z6na2c", "t3_zbtriz", "t3_zuotse", "t3_zuck9m", "t3_zxxeke", "t3_zycipg", "t3_10cnn2l", "t3_10lm2xt", "t3_10og6ip", "t3_10st3r0", "t3_10t7r08", "t3_10tlqmo", "t3_112wgv2", "t3_11a9k43", "t3_11b31re", "t3_11mk18w", "t3_11mrueg", "t3_11ukc7r", "t3_11x2mm6", "t3_137rsam", "t3_13ink97", "t3_13sgu3u", "t3_13vt16r", "t3_146ari6", "t3_14hgshp", "t3_14n3guj", "t3_14nzehw", "t3_14rbo3d", "t3_159f5xc", "t3_15epoo9", "t3_15ivrij", "t3_15mmpi9", "t3_161dw6x", "t3_16tme3p", "t3_16vhq77", "t3_17hp09f", "t3_1892kzi", "t3_18d01eh", "t3_1aevm5d", "t3_1aflfh4", "t3_1aj65ur", "t3_1awevc6", "t3_1ayafsg", "t3_1b51fqk", "t3_1b88jgx", "t3_1bhyfsq"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 3", "created_at_utc": 1651408248.875, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "b061bb3a-9e7f-4aa9-aa7a-e852027799a8", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1714464584.911, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_11ukc7r", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_pz5w9r4n", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1679135705.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1679134844.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is to everyone who struggles to see anything else then colors in their darkroom.

He stretched his arms above his head as if he had been sitting for too long and was pushing physical weariness out of his body. He commanded me to turn off my internal dialogue and enter into inner silence. Then he stood up and began to walk away from the square. He signaled me to follow him. He took a deserted side street. I recognized it as being the same street where Genaro had given me his demonstration of alignment. The moment I recollected that, I found myself walking with don Juan in a place that by then was very familiar to me; a deserted plain with yellow dunes of what seemed to be sulfur.\n\nI recalled then that don Juan had made me perceive that world hundreds of times. I also recalled that beyond the desolate landscape of the dunes there was another world shining with an exquisite, uniform, pure white light.\n\nWhen don Juan and I entered into it this time, I sensed that the light, which came from every direction, was not an invigorating light, but was so soothing that it gave me the feeling that it was sacred.\n\nAs that sacred light bathed me a rational thought exploded in my inner silence. I thought it was quite possible that mystics and saints had made this journey of the assemblage point. They had seen God in the mold of man. They had seen hell in the sulfur dunes. And then they had seen the glory of heaven in the diaphanous light.\n\nMy rational thought burned out almost immediately under the onslaughts of what I was perceiving. My awareness was taken by a multitude of shapes, figures of men, women, and children of all ages, and other incomprehensible apparitions gleaming with a blinding white light.\n\nI saw don Juan, walking by my side, staring at me and not at the apparitions, but the next instant I saw him as a ball of luminosity, bobbing up and down a few feet away from me. The ball made an abrupt and frightening movement and came closer to me and I saw inside it.\n\nDon Juan was working his glow of awareness for my benefit. The glow suddenly shone on four or five threadlike filaments on his left side. It remained fixed there. All my concentration was on it. Something pulled me slowly as if through a tube and I saw the allies- three dark, long, rigid figures agitated by a tremor, like leaves in a breeze. They were against an almost fluorescent pink background. The moment I focused my eyes on them, they came to where I was, not walking or gliding or flying, but by pulling themselves along some fibers of whiteness that came out of me. The whiteness was not a light or a glow but lines that seemed to be drawn with heavy powder chalk. They disintegrated quickly, yet not quickly enough. The allies were on me before the lines faded away.\n\nThey crowded me. I became annoyed, and the allies immediately moved away as if I had chastised them. I felt sorry for them, and my feeling pulled them back instantly. And they again came and rubbed themselves against me. I saw then something I had seen in the mirror at the stream. The allies had no inner glow. They had no inner mobility. There was no life in them. And yet they were obviously alive. They were strange grotesque shapes that resembled zippered-up sleeping bags. The thin line in the middle of their elongated shapes made them look as if they had been sewed up.\n\nThey were not pleasing figures. The sensation that they were totally alien to me made me feel uncomfortable, impatient. I saw that the three allies were moving as if they were jumping up and down. There was a faint glow inside them. The glow grew in intensity until, in at least one of the allies, it was quite brilliant.\n\nThe instant I saw that, I was facing a black world. I do not mean that it was dark as night is dark. It was rather that everything around me was pitch-black. I looked up at the sky and I could not find light anywhere. The sky was also black and literally covered with lines and irregular circles of various degrees of blackness. The sky looked like a black piece of wood where the grain showed in relief.\n\nI looked down at the ground. It was fluffy. It seemed to be made of flakes of agar-agar; they were not dull flakes, but they were not shiny either. It was something in between which I had never seen in my life; black agar-agar.\n\nI heard then the voice of seeing. It said that my assemblage point had assembled a total world with other great bands of emanations; a black world.\n\nI wanted to absorb every word I was hearing. In order to do that I had to split my concentration. The voice stopped. My eyes became focused again. I was standing with don Juan just a few blocks away from the square.\n\nI instantly felt that I had no time to rest, that it would be useless to indulge in being shocked. I rallied all my strength and asked don Juan if I had done what he had expected.\n\n\"You did exactly what you were expected to do,\" he said reassuringly. \"Let's go back to the square and stroll around it one more time; for the last time in this world.\"\n\nI refused to think about don Juan's leaving, so I asked him about the black world. I had vague recollections of having seen it before.\n\n\"It's the easiest world to assemble,\" he said. \"And of all you've experienced, only the black world is worth considering. It is the only true alignment of another great band you have ever made. Everything else has been a lateral shift along man's band, but still within the same great band. The wall of fog, the plain with yellow dunes, the world of the apparitions- all are lateral alignments that our assemblage points make as they approach a crucial position.\"", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jcqk5at", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll look for the passages since I&amp;#39;d like to be reminded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that I could not as yet use the boost of the earth to shift into another great band of emanations, but that since I had an imperative need to shift, that need was going to serve me as a launcher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan looked up at the sky.

My awareness was taken by a multitude of shapes, figures of men, women, and children of all ages, and other incomprehensible apparitions gleaming with a blinding white light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw don Juan, walking by my side, staring at me and not at the apparitions, but the next instant I saw him as a ball of luminosity, bobbing up and down a few feet away from me. The ball made an abrupt and frightening movement and came closer to me and I saw inside it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan was working his glow of awareness for my benefit. The glow suddenly shone on four or five threadlike filaments on his left side. It remained fixed there. All my concentration was on it. Something pulled me slowly as if through a tube and I saw the allies- three dark, long, rigid figures agitated by a tremor, like leaves in a breeze. They were against an almost fluorescent pink background. The moment I focused my eyes on them, they came to where I was, not walking or gliding or flying, but by pulling themselves along some fibers of whiteness that came out of me. The whiteness was not a light or a glow but lines that seemed to be drawn with heavy powder chalk. They disintegrated quickly, yet not quickly enough. The allies were on me before the lines faded away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They crowded me. I became annoyed, and the allies immediately moved away as if I had chastised them. I felt sorry for them, and my feeling pulled them back instantly. And they again came and rubbed themselves against me. I saw then something I had seen in the mirror at the stream. The allies had no inner glow. They had no inner mobility. There was no life in them. And yet they were obviously alive. They were strange grotesque shapes that resembled zippered-up sleeping bags. The thin line in the middle of their elongated shapes made them look as if they had been sewed up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were not pleasing figures. The sensation that they were totally alien to me made me feel uncomfortable, impatient. I saw that the three allies were moving as if they were jumping up and down. There was a faint glow inside them. The glow grew in intensity until, in at least one of the allies, it was quite brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The instant I saw that, I was facing a black world. I do not mean that it was dark as night is dark. It was rather that everything around me was pitch-black. I looked up at the sky and I could not find light anywhere. The sky was also black and literally covered with lines and irregular circles of various degrees of blackness. The sky looked like a black piece of wood where the grain showed in relief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked down at the ground. It was fluffy. It seemed to be made of flakes of agar-agar; they were not dull flakes, but they were not shiny either. It was something in between which I had never seen in my life; black agar-agar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard then the voice of seeing. It said that my assemblage point had assembled a total world with other great bands of emanations; a black world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to absorb every word I was hearing. In order to do that I had to split my concentration. The voice stopped. My eyes became focused again. I was standing with don Juan just a few blocks away from the square.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I instantly felt that I had no time to rest, that it would be useless to indulge in being shocked. I rallied all my strength and asked don Juan if I had done what he had expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You did exactly what you were expected to do,&amp;quot; he said reassuringly. &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s go back to the square and stroll around it one more time; for the last time in this world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I refused to think about don Juan&amp;#39;s leaving, so I asked him about the black world. I had vague recollections of having seen it before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s the easiest world to assemble,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;And of all you&amp;#39;ve experienced, only the black world is worth considering. It is the only true alignment of another great band you have ever made. Everything else has been a lateral shift along man&amp;#39;s band, but still within the same great band. The wall of fog, the plain with yellow dunes, the world of the apparitions- all are lateral alignments that our assemblage points make as they approach a crucial position.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_11ukc7r", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11ukc7r/how_to_open_dreaming_windows_bubbles/jcqk5at/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1679169868.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1679169868.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcqhg6n", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Altruistic-Help-2010", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1679168686.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcozjah", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_8996zhc7", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Can you point me to where I could find out more about the Black world?

It is kind of like zooming out pf a dream&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_11ukc7r", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11ukc7r/how_to_open_dreaming_windows_bubbles/jcpvkk6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1679159663.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcpmutl", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11ukc7r", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11ukc7r/how_to_open_dreaming_windows_bubbles/jcpmutl/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_jcpmutl", "created": 1679156143.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1679156143.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]

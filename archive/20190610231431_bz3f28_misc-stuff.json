Carlos used to say, \u201cMouser Wowser!\u201d when he was excited.\n3. There\u2019s a BIG difference between looking for colors in darkness, and looking for them in twilight. I\u2019ll have to practice the twilight a bit so I can figure out the differences, but if you try to use Zuleica\u2019s techniques in twilight, you won\u2019t have the best results.  Darkness is FPN (fixed pattern noise),  twilight is EE (extrapolation errors).  EE is sort of more advanced because it\u2019s already coming from the second attention.  The colors are not, until you practice with them a bit.   If you can\u2019t make a dark room (spouse, relative, kids), consider \u201cEclipse Goggles\u201d.  Get at least #10, but #14 might be better. I have some on order from China.  Don\u2019t try to use #10 welding glasses, they leak too much light on the sides.\n4. If you are walking in silence and end up in another world, please remember exactly where you left from.  There's one crack in the world in Carlos' compound, near the wooden beam in the main entry way hall.  In Little Tokyo, there's one near a fenced up vacant lot a little ways west from the main businesses.  There's also one in Culver City, but the man who discovered it never gave anyone the precise location.   As absurd as this sounds, it'll be even more absurd when you find one.\n5. When gazing in less than absolute darkness, squinting is ok.  Don Juan did it a bit.  I recently posted a quote from Carlos' books which included an example of him squinting.   But why squint:  Squinting modifies the 3D feeling of what you're looking at, so you can let your mind combine different elements from your sight freely.  For instance, your hand can combine with a wrinkle in the sheet of the bed your sitting on, if you can't see the fact that your hand is not located where the sheet is located.  In total darkness you don't need to squint, because you can't pick up stereo visual information.   The results of combining unrelated things can take on a \"real\" look. If you don't try to correct it, you're engaged in not-doing.  Not-doing causes the brain to try to find more solutions to explain what's going on.  More solutions means the not-doing can become very vivid. Coupled with silence, vivid not-doing helps the assemblage point shift.  Once the assemblage point shifts, that \"phony\" thing you created by squinting and letting your mind combine 2 completely unrelated things, can lead to a higher level of perception of reality.\n6. If you get good at something, but then on some days can't do what you believed you had already learned, consider that in private classes, \"saving energy\" was the #1 theme.  It seemed so vague back then, but once you can use the second attention it becomes anything but vague.  There are 2 things to consider here.   When you\u2019re in the second attention, you are in heightened awareness (an over simplification).  In heightened awareness, you are technically \"asleep\" (another over simplification).  Zuleica calls her techniques, \"dreaming\" techniques.  Add to that the fact that you have to keep changing dreams in the beginning, when you first learn to find your hands and become lucid, and maybe it's the same thing.  To keep going with use of the second attention, maybe you have to \"change dreams\" often, or it will be more difficult due to having used up the energy of that \u201cenergetic strand\u201d (Carlos\u2019 words) you were following.  But also, if you've risen your energy high enough to use the second attention consciously, but have trouble one night, that's where the \"saving energy\" thing comes in.  Consider amount of alcohol, drugs, sex, arguments, coming illness or other sources of tiredness, and see if you don't do better on days where there's less of that.   Don\u2019t worry, it all works. It won\u2019t go away as long as you don\u2019t stop practicing.  If it does, there's a reason you can correct for.\n7. Please keep angry politics out of sorcery.

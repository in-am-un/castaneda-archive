It seems like a hopeless task, and at times the constant flow of new people who have no chance to ever become serious and learn, makes you wonder if we don't just get very damaged people.\n\nThey just can't let go of the idea of becoming \"teachers\", even if they have to make up total nonsense and become what are essentially con artists to achieve that.\n\nBut the very worst part is, you realize that ALL of modern (less than 8000 years old) philosophy, religions, and magical systems are nonsense.  Designed to steal.\n\nAnd at times it seems a bit like trying to restore magic to the world is similar to trying to plant a magical red flower, almost extinct, in a field of goats.\n\nThe goats are mindlessly chomping everything in their path.\n\nIn their own way, they aren't evil.  They even stop to admire the pretty red flowers when they see them. It's such a rare sight!  Their eyes light up and in their own goat way they smile, think \"how beautiful\", and then instead of leaving it alone to grow more and maybe even produce seeds, they chomp it down.\n\nWe've got a few red flower seeds we're trying to plant in a safe location,  but in a world of chomping,  mindless eating machine goats, it's hopeless.\n\nI might even say, at this time there's no way to restore magic to the world.  There's just far too many goats,  and too few goat free locations.\n\nI suppose if one of you who finally understands what sorcery is could find a tropical island somewhere, you might manage to teach a few there.  And in that one location it's possible magic could rise up again. I still firmly believe some ancient \"Islander Shamanism\" still survives somewhere.\n\nHoping to transplant magic to a safe island is a bit like the proto-siberians who had the spark of ancient magic, traveling across the Bering straits with half of them heading for eastern Mexico.  There magic flourished for thousands of years and grew to incredible heights.\n\nIt's where we got what we have.\n\nBut eventually enemy native american populations from other parts of Mexico broke up that protected paradise, and we know the history of how magic had to flee through the violent Toltecs, and into hidden lineages in the long run.\n\nI don't \"believe\" it's likely we'll be wiped out this time around. We have the internet.\n\nBut we need to prepare for that anyway.\n\nThen in comes my new $285 Walmart streaming media 55\" TV, which has exposed me to television not oriented for old men the way cable is.\n\nI've seen \"Stranger Things\", \"Locke and Key\", all the latest \"Star Wars\", and come  to realize that people REALLY do crave magic.  Otherwise those types of programs wouldn't get made.\n\nSoledad the witch realized the same thing, and tried to influence Hollywood perhaps by dangling leftover lineage money around there.  And we got Star Wars,  Walker Texas Ranger,  and a bunch of other stuff with a more lifestyle oriented magical theme. I suppose the idea is that a seemingly ordinary person can work their way up to develop magical powers.\n\nNaturally I found out my super bargain TV was not.  Amazon was selling it for less than half yesterday.  Which I suppose is good, because now I don't feel as great about that damned TV.\n\nCholita refused the one I offered her.  And she has no television where she likely spends most of her time.\n\nBut it did teach me one thing.  Watching streaming media TV on youtube,  not Youtube+, I realized that fans make shows and those get play.  They aren't good enough for the \"plus\" version, but good enough to show up on program listings for the free version.\n\nI couldn't believe all the \"New Star Treks\".\n\nSome really good!  They have bizarro versions of all of the cast, with actors even amusing themselves imitating the weird personality quirks of the original actors and all the 1 hour romances ending in heartbreak.\n\nSome so good, you can't believe they had no permission to make that clone of the original series, and couldn't make any profit from it by law.\n\nBut they did anyway.  No profit motives.  They just liked that show so much.\n\nYou even got entire versions where all the actors are at east 70 pounds overweight.  And wearing baggy uniforms rented from a Halloween store.  Star Trek fans often come in plus sizes.\n\nBut they still managed to make it entertaining enough that Youtube will be playing that for the next 500 years.\n\nThe shows were made by people who just loved the show, and then preserved by a soulless company who's only motivation is profit.\n\nThe fan made Star Trek \"books\", such as that of Quantum Shaman woman, the self-proclaimed \"double\" who managed to trick some private class members into thinking she was the real thing, originally became famous writing her own Star Trek version.  With Mr. Spock having lurid illogical romances all over the place I presume.  She took the fantasy of Star Trek, and went overboard for a female audience who likely found the original a bit boring, with it's green slave women.\n\nI suppose she could capture imaginations in her writings, and finally ended up with her own bizarre writings on our subject, sorcery.\n\nFooled a lot of women with it despite her daily angry political rants on facebook.  You'd think that would clue sorcery students in to what she really was, but unfortunately angry politics has always been a thread in sorcery.  Carlos had his followers who said Reagan was the devil, and he'd begrudgingly go along with it. But even in the books there's a hint of angry Mexican politics.\n\nAfter she died the facebook friend base of Quantum Shaman woman needed to go elsewhere, and I ended up with women on my own facebook who then realized she was a total fraud.   I got \"confessions\" in chat.  That they fell for it.\n\nSome of them have a chance to actually learn sorcery now.\n\nIt's a bit of a lesson, but I don't know exactly what that is.\n\nThe question is, how much of an audience will her books have with her gone?  She died this year.\n\nNot many.\n\nThere's no profit in anyone else pushing those.\n\nAs she must have, to cause them to be as widely read as they were, such as it was.\n\nBut Youtube is a hungry video machine.  It's like a goat munching down all physical matter it can sniff out in its path.\n\nAnd it likes to eat video.\n\nWhich means, if we want to save magic it's a very good idea to make videos.\n\nWriting just doesn't survive past the death of the author.\n\nAnd if we all die, this subreddit will be taken over by very bad men.\n\nLook at the books of Carlos!\n\nEvery decent bookstore in the United States had an entire shelf dedicated to \"Carlos Castaneda\" while he was alive.  But once he was dead, the goats started munching and you ended up with the books of absolute con artists replacing his. Miguel, Victor, Ken, Monroe, Armando, Marilyn. Even \"The Nagual Speedos\", Krelmen from facebook,  has his own book and does staged interviews.\n\nThe makers of \"The Spot\" cartoon had the right idea.  Dubious motives for sure as the initial \"over the top bad ass background music\" made clear.  But the right idea for how to save the teachings from being munched into extinction.  You needed to switch to a more popular media type. And as long as you didn't profit from it, it's legal. Copyright or not.\n\nAnd even better, copyright or not, it can play on Youtube.\n\nI'm not sure how that works...\n\nIt's actually a little ironic that videos are the best way to save the teachings, because don Juan recommends that we learn to view Silent Knowledge in text form.\n\nIt's not \"easier\".  It's so specific, it is in fact harder.  There's so many other ways to view it, that the easiest thing is to just take what you are offered without trying to make it be something else.\n\nDon Juan deliberately added a tiny bit of grime to our link to intent!  I'm not completely sure why.  He might have feared \"Goat Madness\", if you can read between the lines.\n\nFor example, a Silent Knowledge Entity taught me to stand on a dreaming chunk of polished granite, in an alien flat world, and gaze up to find Silent Knowledge. He explained that the presentation method was my dreaming double, and the tonal was now almost invisible despite me being fully awake.\n\nIt was wonderful, but imagine the book deals!  Selling the polished granite blocks alone could make Sergio wealthy.\n\nWhereas the Olmecs liked to watch videos in the sky, like you see on the cover of Wheel of Time.\n\nThose come naturally, without effort.  Along with magical objects which can be sprinkled like Fairy Dust, to manifest complicated things like cabinets in which to keep dreaming tools.\n\nWe've already seen that new people in the subreddit only very rarely take the time to study the older posts.  All that work only served to motivate people who came in when the post was made.\n\nAlmost no one goes back and reads older posts, even though if you read all of them you'd have all the knowledge you need to become a real sorcerer.\n\nIt was the best we could do, but the wrong media type.\n\nIt won't be preserved much, because there's no profit in it.  We're the only ones who would try to maintain that path.\n\nBut videos play on reddit too,  so we just don't have the ideal media type yet. The learning curve to make better media is huge, but if we can manage it then places like Youtube will preserve and spread it for us.  Long into the future.\n\nVideo games and  virtual realities also flow from that technology with almost no effort, so that you could lure people in with fun to watch videos, and then teach them electronically.  Even after we're all gone.  Everyone could have a \"virtual Kylie\" in their home.\n\nThe munching goats can't destroy that.  They'll wipe out this place, as several have already tried to do.  Batman's cave angry subreddit for casts outs,  Running crazy guy's reddit video rants, and a few no one in here knows about such as the Qabalah guy trying to lure me away because he misunderstood my interest in Qabalah.\n\nAnd the reality surfing make believe guy who spent months in here shoplifting.\n\nThe munching goats may not notice red flowers that grow in places they haven't gotten to yet, but there's no way the nearly extinct flowers will survive in the long run.\n\nOnly the red flowers growing on the mountain have a chance.  The goats can get up there, but its too much work as long as there's flatlands with lots of matter to consume.\n\nIt's too much work to make videos, for greedy attention seeking con artist goats.\n\nBut the point of this post was actually something magical I saw in Silent Knowledge.\n\nIt's about \"the abstract\".   And how it destroys profit motivations. It's just pure experience, minus all need for \"meaning\".\n\nWithout meaning, there can be no greed.\n\nWhat we need most in new people.  But it only surfaces far out on the J curve.\n\nIf you ever had a feverish vision due to a high temperature from an illness as a child, something not life threatening and not totally awful so that you can't even rest, you might have fallen into a feverish dream. Where you lay on your side unwilling to get up, just needing rest, and you fell into a half awake dream loop.\n\nI once fell into a doozy!  I was a round ball, traveling down a tube with running water.\n\nThe water was carrying me in the tube, and it had predictable twists and turns.\n\nAt the end I plunged out of the tube and into a swirling pool with a splash, then I \"reset\" and found myself back at the start again. Still as a round ball entering a tube.\n\nIt kept repeating for what could have been hours, and I started to enjoy it.  I became curious how a dream could repeat like that.\n\nIt was \"abstract dreaming\".  Something the Allies know about full well.  They can manipulate you as you fall to sleep, and push you into such a thing. Then feast on your energy as you view the repeating abstract dream.\n\nThose never make any sense, which is the key point.  Why they can trap you.\n\nYou aren't \"you\" in those.  And so your reason is gone.  You might find yourself counting magical objects, worried one is missing.  But after you count \"one, two, three\" magical jars laying on top of your stomach, you realize it makes no sense at all.  Your tonal rationality begins to assert itself, you try to see what those magical jars are. You notice they're actually pillows, and then discover there's a strange woman sitting on the bed next to the pillows, pressing down on them.  She's even making it a little hard to breathe.\n\nKeep in mind, your double is fine with all this.  The portion of your awareness that didn't get trapped in an organic body has no worries or concerns.  He just likes fascinating visions and experiences.    As don Juan put it, he gets obsessed with the most asinine details in dreams.\n\nIt's why you NEED to find your hands in 4 gates dreaming, or it simply doesn't count. You have to \"fuel up\" on purpose and rationality.\n\nAnd the allies can make the coolest magical jars you ever imagined. They pull from your own memories of Aladdin and his Genie, or from movies about kings so wealthy, even their jars were made of shiny gold and covered in jewels.  They can even draw from a Star Trek or two, and give you one of those Alien Transport drone Jars like from Deep Space 9.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Magical object from deep space 9, easily copyable for an inorganic being trick.](https://preview.redd.it/u7v7xv41pdt91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=252b2bca3703ca852218e5f08d8a23bcdbca671f)\n\nSo the double, who never sleeps, might even find it restful to watch the magical jars for hours and hours.\n\nBut your tonal rationality can assert itself, and cause you to wake up.  At which point the woman sitting on the bed at your side, pressing down on the magical jar pillows, will no longer be able to feast on your awareness.\n\nSo she \"resets\" you back to the start of the vision.\n\nIt's easy for an inorganic being to do that, once your tonal is trapped and trying to escape by reasserting rationality. It's likely how they trap you in their world.\n\nWhen your tonal rationality looks to see how magical jars are even possible, almost waking up,  your captor inorganic being whispers in your ear, \"But are there still 3 magical jars or has someone stolen one?\"\n\nShe appeals to greed, which can overcome reason and purpose.  And the loop repeats.\n\nThere's a good example of this in the books, likely \"Tales of Power\".  Don Genaro takes Carlos fully into \"the Nagual\", and with very high \"abstract content\" they fly around the tall trees, dressed in animal cosplay pajamas.\n\nDon Juan wanted to show Carlos that \"the Nagual\" is often impossible to describe, and doesn't make any sense.  And yet you can experience it all the same, and at the time it's kind of nice.\n\nPlus it has the added benefit of, there's no profit in it.\n\nEven the munching goats occasionally stop to play in the trees together.\n\nAs humans, we were born into a world that insists on profit.\n\nA baby is fed by its mother and provided for completely, being allowed to be totally selfish and enjoy or hate what it likes.\n\nBut that quickly ends, and the little person is forced to seek profit.\n\nThe profit seeking never ends for some.  It just gets worse and worse, and the feeling they aren't profiting as much as the others around them grows.\n\nUntil you get crazy selfish profiteers even invading our subreddit.   Mindless red flower munching goats.\n\nWe used to be a bit more tolerant, thinking you could reason with the goats and point out how fun tree climbing can be instead.\n\nBut most are simply \"broken\". They'll never snap out of the greedy quest for rare red flowers to consume.\n\nSo we've become a bit less tolerant, and try to bang them on the head right away to see if there's any glimmer of remorse in their eyes.\n\nIf not, they start to scream as goats can do.\n\nI didn't know that until I got the $285 TV and saw \"Thor, Love and Thunder\".  The most fun stars of that movie are two screaming giant goats.\n\nSo we no longer try to reform the red flower hungry goats who come here.  We just bang them on the head right away, and see if life comes into their eyes.\n\nThose get to stick around.\n\nBut it's still nearly hopeless.  They won't make any effort to change over time.  Maybe they were just looking for someone to bang them on the head and stop them, and thus become obsessed with gaining your respect through acceptable pretending.\n\nThey work on finding what kind of pretending is acceptable so they can get \"respect\",  instead of being banged on the head.\n\nI think those are damaged goats.  Maybe they were raised on a very cruel goat farm, and have \"owner issues\".   Trying to resolve the childhood trauma of an evil goat head banging farmer.\n\nI doubt there's any hope for those.  One might call them \"groupies\".\n\nBut a few come in, realize we like to climb on trees, and join us!\n\nIt's possible you could even create a survey and determine which new goats might like to play, and aren't consumed by the search for red flower profits.\n\nDo they like to hike?  Did they ever take walks at night, even though they had no weight loss goals?\n\nDid they explore caves as children, hunt for rocks to polish like Taisha, or did they try to stalk an elusive Falcon as Carlos did? Only to let it go when it was in their rifle sights?\n\nDo they learn on their own, or do they always insist you have to go to a school, and get \"certified by an institute\" such as Robert Monroe's?\n\nDo they ever engage in \"unprofitable ventures\"  just because it's fun.  Even if it's hard work?\n\nThat might be our best chance.  Those types.\n\nBut they're very few among the munching goat populations. Our social structure quickly turns all babies into profit obsessed munchers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 1, "clicked": false, "title": "The Not-Doing of Not Profiting", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"8ph66n849ct91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8ph66n849ct91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e28da22e8907f49b1fdf167424899198ab4b4204"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8ph66n849ct91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a485b5c9dcbed59c47fd6f84bd984dc386ff9e9"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8ph66n849ct91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c021d5b2bbb4e8b3138aafc0fa387037637dc74d"}, {"y": 480, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8ph66n849ct91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a902edf24af33d2b8190ffc0da0e015965c368c"}, {"y": 720, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8ph66n849ct91.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1632a239af09a1f1b08a4c57893d458e9fdc60a0"}], "s": {"y": 768, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/8ph66n849ct91.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d02f1dc488bce2294f9d6310371fb07e14ea1e1"}, "id": "8ph66n849ct91"}, "u7v7xv41pdt91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u7v7xv41pdt91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=308baa8949aac22ba298c6afd7827239a9e70668"}, {"y": 163, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u7v7xv41pdt91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd830782209041b25faa147b6d30468b28135068"}, {"y": 242, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u7v7xv41pdt91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e007c5635ba8a80604396624f11f6dd1b8a717d"}, {"y": 485, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u7v7xv41pdt91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77691a7fb686064c71fc7c127b764bf5d501253a"}], "s": {"y": 485, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/u7v7xv41pdt91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=252b2bca3703ca852218e5f08d8a23bcdbca671f"}, "id": "u7v7xv41pdt91"}}, "name": "t3_y1ylpf", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 35, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 35, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/rawRWqv0DFe0zrDMCeEBdphJ-0ILur8sBB8eyn8M0Z4.jpg", "edited": 1665601417.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1665564659.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8ph66n849ct91.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3d02f1dc488bce2294f9d6310371fb07e14ea1e1\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/8ph66n849ct91.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3d02f1dc488bce2294f9d6310371fb07e14ea1e1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is an incomplete thought that came to me from Silent Knowledge, but seemed so obvious and clear at the time, I wanted to make sure I didn&amp;#39;t lose it so that we could figure it out and add it to animations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re trying to restore magic to the world.

We have the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we need to prepare for that anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then in comes my new $285 Walmart streaming media 55&amp;quot; TV, which has exposed me to television not oriented for old men the way cable is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen &amp;quot;Stranger Things&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Locke and Key&amp;quot;, all the latest &amp;quot;Star Wars&amp;quot;, and come  to realize that people REALLY do crave magic.

And she has no television where she likely spends most of her time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it did teach me one thing.  Watching streaming media TV on youtube,  not Youtube+, I realized that fans make shows and those get play.  They aren&amp;#39;t good enough for the &amp;quot;plus&amp;quot; version, but good enough to show up on program listings for the free version.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t believe all the &amp;quot;New Star Treks&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some really good!  They have bizarro versions of all of the cast, with actors even amusing themselves imitating the weird personality quirks of the original actors and all the 1 hour romances ending in heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some so good, you can&amp;#39;t believe they had no permission to make that clone of the original series, and couldn&amp;#39;t make any profit from it by law.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they did anyway.  No profit motives.  They just liked that show so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You even got entire versions where all the actors are at east 70 pounds overweight.  And wearing baggy uniforms rented from a Halloween store.  Star Trek fans often come in plus sizes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they still managed to make it entertaining enough that Youtube will be playing that for the next 500 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The shows were made by people who just loved the show, and then preserved by a soulless company who&amp;#39;s only motivation is profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fan made Star Trek &amp;quot;books&amp;quot;, such as that of Quantum Shaman woman, the self-proclaimed &amp;quot;double&amp;quot; who managed to trick some private class members into thinking she was the real thing, originally became famous writing her own Star Trek version.  With Mr. Spock having lurid illogical romances all over the place I presume.  She took the fantasy of Star Trek, and went overboard for a female audience who likely found the original a bit boring, with it&amp;#39;s green slave women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose she could capture imaginations in her writings, and finally ended up with her own bizarre writings on our subject, sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fooled a lot of women with it despite her daily angry political rants on facebook.  You&amp;#39;d think that would clue sorcery students in to what she really was, but unfortunately angry politics has always been a thread in sorcery.  Carlos had his followers who said Reagan was the devil, and he&amp;#39;d begrudgingly go along with it. But even in the books there&amp;#39;s a hint of angry Mexican politics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After she died the facebook friend base of Quantum Shaman woman needed to go elsewhere, and I ended up with women on my own facebook who then realized she was a total fraud.   I got &amp;quot;confessions&amp;quot; in chat.  That they fell for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of them have a chance to actually learn sorcery now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bit of a lesson, but I don&amp;#39;t know exactly what that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question is, how much of an audience will her books have with her gone?  She died this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not many.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no profit in anyone else pushing those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As she must have, to cause them to be as widely read as they were, such as it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Youtube is a hungry video machine.  It&amp;#39;s like a goat munching down all physical matter it can sniff out in its path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it likes to eat video.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, if we want to save magic it&amp;#39;s a very good idea to make videos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Writing just doesn&amp;#39;t survive past the death of the author.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if we all die, this subreddit will be taken over by very bad men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at the books of Carlos!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every decent bookstore in the United States had an entire shelf dedicated to &amp;quot;Carlos Castaneda&amp;quot; while he was alive.  But once he was dead, the goats started munching and you ended up with the books of absolute con artists replacing his. Miguel, Victor, Ken, Monroe, Armando, Marilyn. Even &amp;quot;The Nagual Speedos&amp;quot;, Krelmen from facebook,  has his own book and does staged interviews.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The makers of &amp;quot;The Spot&amp;quot; cartoon had the right idea.  Dubious motives for sure as the initial &amp;quot;over the top bad ass background music&amp;quot; made clear.  But the right idea for how to save the teachings from being munched into extinction.  You needed to switch to a more popular media type. And as long as you didn&amp;#39;t profit from it, it&amp;#39;s legal. Copyright or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even better, copyright or not, it can play on Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how that works...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually a little ironic that videos are the best way to save the teachings, because don Juan recommends that we learn to view Silent Knowledge in text form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;easier&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s so specific, it is in fact harder.  There&amp;#39;s so many other ways to view it, that the easiest thing is to just take what you are offered without trying to make it be something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan deliberately added a tiny bit of grime to our link to intent!  I&amp;#39;m not completely sure why.  He might have feared &amp;quot;Goat Madness&amp;quot;, if you can read between the lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, a Silent Knowledge Entity taught me to stand on a dreaming chunk of polished granite, in an alien flat world, and gaze up to find Silent Knowledge. He explained that the presentation method was my dreaming double, and the tonal was now almost invisible despite me being fully awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was wonderful, but imagine the book deals!  Selling the polished granite blocks alone could make Sergio wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whereas the Olmecs liked to watch videos in the sky, like you see on the cover of Wheel of Time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those come naturally, without effort.  Along with magical objects which can be sprinkled like Fairy Dust, to manifest complicated things like cabinets in which to keep dreaming tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve already seen that new people in the subreddit only very rarely take the time to study the older posts.  All that work only served to motivate people who came in when the post was made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost no one goes back and reads older posts, even though if you read all of them you&amp;#39;d have all the knowledge you need to become a real sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the best we could do, but the wrong media type.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t be preserved much, because there&amp;#39;s no profit in it.  We&amp;#39;re the only ones who would try to maintain that path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But videos play on reddit too,  so we just don&amp;#39;t have the ideal media type yet. The learning curve to make better media is huge, but if we can manage it then places like Youtube will preserve and spread it for us.  Long into the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Video games and  virtual realities also flow from that technology with almost no effort, so that you could lure people in with fun to watch videos, and then teach them electronically.  Even after we&amp;#39;re all gone.  Everyone could have a &amp;quot;virtual Kylie&amp;quot; in their home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The munching goats can&amp;#39;t destroy that.  They&amp;#39;ll wipe out this place, as several have already tried to do.  Batman&amp;#39;s cave angry subreddit for casts outs,  Running crazy guy&amp;#39;s reddit video rants, and a few no one in here knows about such as the Qabalah guy trying to lure me away because he misunderstood my interest in Qabalah.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the reality surfing make believe guy who spent months in here shoplifting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The munching goats may not notice red flowers that grow in places they haven&amp;#39;t gotten to yet, but there&amp;#39;s no way the nearly extinct flowers will survive in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only the red flowers growing on the mountain have a chance.  The goats can get up there, but its too much work as long as there&amp;#39;s flatlands with lots of matter to consume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s too much work to make videos, for greedy attention seeking con artist goats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the point of this post was actually something magical I saw in Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s about &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot;.   And how it destroys profit motivations. It&amp;#39;s just pure experience, minus all need for &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without meaning, there can be no greed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we need most in new people.  But it only surfaces far out on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you ever had a feverish vision due to a high temperature from an illness as a child, something not life threatening and not totally awful so that you can&amp;#39;t even rest, you might have fallen into a feverish dream. Where you lay on your side unwilling to get up, just needing rest, and you fell into a half awake dream loop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once fell into a doozy!  I was a round ball, traveling down a tube with running water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The water was carrying me in the tube, and it had predictable twists and turns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end I plunged out of the tube and into a swirling pool with a splash, then I &amp;quot;reset&amp;quot; and found myself back at the start again. Still as a round ball entering a tube.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It kept repeating for what could have been hours, and I started to enjoy it.  I became curious how a dream could repeat like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was &amp;quot;abstract dreaming&amp;quot;.  Something the Allies know about full well.  They can manipulate you as you fall to sleep, and push you into such a thing. Then feast on your energy as you view the repeating abstract dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those never make any sense, which is the key point.  Why they can trap you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; in those.  And so your reason is gone.  You might find yourself counting magical objects, worried one is missing.  But after you count &amp;quot;one, two, three&amp;quot; magical jars laying on top of your stomach, you realize it makes no sense at all.  Your tonal rationality begins to assert itself, you try to see what those magical jars are. You notice they&amp;#39;re actually pillows, and then discover there&amp;#39;s a strange woman sitting on the bed next to the pillows, pressing down on them.  She&amp;#39;s even making it a little hard to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, your double is fine with all this.  The portion of your awareness that didn&amp;#39;t get trapped in an organic body has no worries or concerns.  He just likes fascinating visions and experiences.    As don Juan put it, he gets obsessed with the most asinine details in dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why you NEED to find your hands in 4 gates dreaming, or it simply doesn&amp;#39;t count. You have to &amp;quot;fuel up&amp;quot; on purpose and rationality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the allies can make the coolest magical jars you ever imagined. They pull from your own memories of Aladdin and his Genie, or from movies about kings so wealthy, even their jars were made of shiny gold and covered in jewels.  They can even draw from a Star Trek or two, and give you one of those Alien Transport drone Jars like from Deep Space 9.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/u7v7xv41pdt91.png?width=640&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=252b2bca3703ca852218e5f08d8a23bcdbca671f\"&gt;Magical object from deep space 9, easily copyable for an inorganic being trick.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the double, who never sleeps, might even find it restful to watch the magical jars for hours and hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But your tonal rationality can assert itself, and cause you to wake up.  At which point the woman sitting on the bed at your side, pressing down on the magical jar pillows, will no longer be able to feast on your awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she &amp;quot;resets&amp;quot; you back to the start of the vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy for an inorganic being to do that, once your tonal is trapped and trying to escape by reasserting rationality. It&amp;#39;s likely how they trap you in their world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When your tonal rationality looks to see how magical jars are even possible, almost waking up,  your captor inorganic being whispers in your ear, &amp;quot;But are there still 3 magical jars or has someone stolen one?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She appeals to greed, which can overcome reason and purpose.  And the loop repeats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a good example of this in the books, likely &amp;quot;Tales of Power&amp;quot;.  Don Genaro takes Carlos fully into &amp;quot;the Nagual&amp;quot;, and with very high &amp;quot;abstract content&amp;quot; they fly around the tall trees, dressed in animal cosplay pajamas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan wanted to show Carlos that &amp;quot;the Nagual&amp;quot; is often impossible to describe, and doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense.  And yet you can experience it all the same, and at the time it&amp;#39;s kind of nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus it has the added benefit of, there&amp;#39;s no profit in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the munching goats occasionally stop to play in the trees together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As humans, we were born into a world that insists on profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A baby is fed by its mother and provided for completely, being allowed to be totally selfish and enjoy or hate what it likes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that quickly ends, and the little person is forced to seek profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The profit seeking never ends for some.  It just gets worse and worse, and the feeling they aren&amp;#39;t profiting as much as the others around them grows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until you get crazy selfish profiteers even invading our subreddit.   Mindless red flower munching goats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We used to be a bit more tolerant, thinking you could reason with the goats and point out how fun tree climbing can be instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But most are simply &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot;. They&amp;#39;ll never snap out of the greedy quest for rare red flowers to consume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;ve become a bit less tolerant, and try to bang them on the head right away to see if there&amp;#39;s any glimmer of remorse in their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not, they start to scream as goats can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know that until I got the $285 TV and saw &amp;quot;Thor, Love and Thunder&amp;quot;.  The most fun stars of that movie are two screaming giant goats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we no longer try to reform the red flower hungry goats who come here.  We just bang them on the head right away, and see if life comes into their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those get to stick around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s still nearly hopeless.  They won&amp;#39;t make any effort to change over time.  Maybe they were just looking for someone to bang them on the head and stop them, and thus become obsessed with gaining your respect through acceptable pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They work on finding what kind of pretending is acceptable so they can get &amp;quot;respect&amp;quot;,  instead of being banged on the head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think those are damaged goats.  Maybe they were raised on a very cruel goat farm, and have &amp;quot;owner issues&amp;quot;.   Trying to resolve the childhood trauma of an evil goat head banging farmer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I doubt there&amp;#39;s any hope for those.  One might call them &amp;quot;groupies&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a few come in, realize we like to climb on trees, and join us!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible you could even create a survey and determine which new goats might like to play, and aren&amp;#39;t consumed by the search for red flower profits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do they like to hike?  Did they ever take walks at night, even though they had no weight loss goals?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did they explore caves as children, hunt for rocks to polish like Taisha, or did they try to stalk an elusive Falcon as Carlos did? Only to let it go when it was in their rifle sights?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do they learn on their own, or do they always insist you have to go to a school, and get &amp;quot;certified by an institute&amp;quot; such as Robert Monroe&amp;#39;s?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do they ever engage in &amp;quot;unprofitable ventures&amp;quot;  just because it&amp;#39;s fun.  Even if it&amp;#39;s hard work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That might be our best chance.  Those types.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;re very few among the munching goat populations. Our social structure quickly turns all babies into profit obsessed munchers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "14394d18-6006-11ea-b6bf-0e2e5ff77301", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "y1ylpf", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 12, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/y1ylpf/the_notdoing_of_not_profiting/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/y1ylpf/the_notdoing_of_not_profiting/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1665564659.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "is2is0j", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_is2hcgz", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Cleargreen was created by Carlos to solve the problem of teaching sorcery in parks, bringing out too many bad men to keep doing it.

At least people had to pay something and wouldn&amp;#39;t heckle him the whole class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He put Reni in charge of the organization, and she controls it to this day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its task is to teach and preserve the tensegrity moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s named &amp;quot;cleargreen&amp;quot;, apparently because there&amp;#39;s a unique hue to some sorcerers, a rare one, and Carlos kept getting too many of those, ready for him to teach them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jadey is green, Carlos said so himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;clear green&amp;quot; hue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s double is green in the far reaches of the second attention, although just below the shoulder blades it&amp;#39;s more like a dream phantom and has a blue or whitish bleached out color. The green only comes when it&amp;#39;s so far into the second attention, she&amp;#39;s no longer in a little dream bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Namely, when her double tries to follow me too far in to the second attention for the energetic mass of women other than doubles or super skilled witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My energy seems to be green also, because mine has risen high enough to tap with my hands like water, and it is clearly greenish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A surprise. I was worried until Jadey came along. I&amp;#39;d never heard of the green hue people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cleargreen has done its job since Carlos died, but there&amp;#39;s some worry they made up a few new Tensegrity moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just CANNOT do that.  No on in there is qualified to even think of such a thing, other than Carol Tiggs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they didn&amp;#39;t bother to tell us where the new moves came from, so it makes me suspicious they don&amp;#39;t even understand what Tensegrity is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they do protect it, as Carlos assigned them to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s no real complaints.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than, why did they let the reputation of Carlos go into the toilet for the last 2 decades?  If you googled him, all you got was &amp;quot;Carlos Castaneda was thoroughly debunked&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was nothing to counter it.  Now, there&amp;#39;s plenty out there thanks to this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that was their bad.  But it could have been on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the wild card of old lineage people still being around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soledad was around for sure, and La Gorda too.  Plus at least 4 others by workshop lecture notes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos died early, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean Beningo and the rest who came to LA did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita has a mysterious benefactor or two,  other than me.  I caught her talking to one last week. Didn&amp;#39;t know I was outside her door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;#39;t using a telephone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hers no longer works.

So let it be with Caesar.\u201d Cancel culture was around even in Shakespeare\u2019s time. These days, it\u2019s more like the evil that people do is the only thing that people remember; the good that they do is buried beneath their flaws.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main problem with cancel culture is that it tends to involve making judgments about decades of a person\u2019s life based on one tweet or a 10-second video. People are complex. Most people are a mix of good and bad....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...Our society\u2019s appetite for canceling is fed by our need to feel superior.

I was in the kind of dreaming that comes from the level of silence you can achieve by moving your assemblage point the entire length of the J curve.\n\nSo whether I actually was in fact awake or merely in my double in my real bedroom, is debatable.\n\nIt might not even be a situation where one or the other has to be true. Could be both were true at the same time.\n\nI'd earlier moved my assemblage point from my left shoulder blade to the bottom of my back, using Tensegrity in silence with perfect darkness.\n\nThen under and up to the front on the right side of the belly, an inch or so above the navel.\n\nThat's all really just in the center of Man's band of emanations. The assemblage point, given no Nagual around to push it down the middle,  naturally moves along the outside of that 1 foot patch through the egg.\n\nSee the second attention assemblage point video for a visual of it. I had to move that link to a comment, the first one in this post. Reddit was deciding to grab that as the picture for the post.\n\nMan's band of emanations is the \"cheese slice\" don Juan said runs down the center of our \"ball of jack cheese\" luminous shell, at a slight angle.\n\nWhen it reaches that final destination on the front, perhaps with a slight left offset to make it \"sublime\", you are in silent knowledge.\n\nDon't worry, you'll notice it!\n\nIt's like being Yoda searching the entire galaxy for Anakin to see why he's in pain.\n\nHe can see everywhere in time and space, although not as clearly as he'd like.\n\nDon Juan said he preferred that final assemblage point position slightly left shifted.\n\nSublime is to the left, activity is to the right.\n\nOverly simplified of course.  But theoretically, you get closer to the great band of emanations to the left of Man's band in your egg, and you get \"sublime\".  And heaven, prosperity, and insect awareness.\n\nCloser to the other great band touching Man's band on the right, and you get physical activity. Sex, violence and shapeshifting into powerful beasts.\n\nI know \"sublime\" sounds cool, but do you really want to turn into a fly the way Carol Tiggs learned to do?\n\nYou never know where those creatures have been feasting.\n\nBut the cheese slice of Man's band of emanations is at an angle, so if you keep the assemblage point in the middle of Man's band it naturally moves from left to right, visually, as it travels that J curve.\n\nIt's on the right in the front that it aligns to that of our energy body, making Silent Knowledge possible.\n\nAs Carlos stated, dreams you enter using silence instead of slumber are \"real\".\n\nIt's why women can use womb dreaming, whereas men should never try to use \"dreaming\" as a path to learn sorcery.\n\nThat's a total misunderstanding of \"The Art of Dreaming\", to believe you can do that.\n\nThe Art of Dreaming book is super advanced, and most of what happens during the gates is not done asleep at all.\n\nBut no one paid attention to the fine details.\n\nMost of that book is in fact in *dreaming*, but their physical bodies never went to sleep to get there.\n\nMen who pretend to be learning sorcery just by paying attention to the dreams they can remember, instead of doing any actual work, will just lie about their ordinary sleeping dreams in order to steal attention from others.\n\nThey don't get into those dreams using silence.  And they never find their hands and look from object to object, so as to inject tonal rationality into the dreamer.\n\nThey just remember what they can, and twist it around to get out of doing any work.\n\nThe same way people who practice meditation do, to make it seem as if that's actually a useful path to anything other than egomania and your own little throne to sit on.\n\nMeanwhile womb dreaming is based on silence, and also the fact that women have a storage area for the dark energy of inorganic beings.\n\nAnd loads of natural talent men don't have.\n\nWomen just need to be motivated and to have a worthy goal.  And to stick with it.\n\nThey don't really need much else.\n\nAs a result of my earlier darkroom practices,  I suppose I had drifted from one \"real\" dream to another until 10PM,  at which time I sat up and looked at my social media on my laptop.\n\nIt was all messed up using wrong pictures and such.  Someone had swapped out counterfeit images and wrong explanations for them.\n\nI tried to figure out who had done it, and realized it made no sense.\n\nAt first I thought it was someone else, but then realized I was the one who had done it.\n\nA copy of myself.\n\nSitting on the bed 2 feet from what I currently felt was the \"real\" me trying to get to the bottom of this madness.\n\nI could move right 2 feet on the bed and be \"him\", or back 2 feet and be \"me\".\n\nWhich was kind of cool!\n\nEven though, obviously I wasn't myself.\n\nI wasn't \"solid\" in either version.\n\nI figured the longer than usual practice session with a 4 day weekend had moved me to some stable alternate personality, or alternate copy of myself.\n\nI suppose you might say it wasn't as stable as those \"cyclic beings\" Carlos taught us about,  which seem to just be one of 600 alternate positions of the assemblage point which have their own stable world to go with them.\n\nMaybe I was only delusional, confused,  or accepting the abstract as being just as good as our normal flow of reality?\n\nBut I was able to move my assemblage point back to normal.\n\nAnd I realized none of my social media had been changed.\n\nThat was \"over there\". In that other copy of reality.\n\nSo I lay on my side hoping to move back to where I could examine what had been done to instagram, in detail, so as to see if the whole thing was rational enough to even make any sense at all.\n\nI was concerned I had switched to another copy of myself which was too irrational to be of any use.\n\nAnd in less than a minute I was back to being that other person.\n\nWho had a goal of altering that social media feed in order to explain some other way to move the assemblage point. Possibly the one he'd just used, to become himself.\n\nAn \"irrational\" way to move it based on observations, rather than techniques.\n\nI could go back and forth between the two versions of myself, but not easily.\n\nThere was a \"blank out\" of a few seconds going from one to the other, and chances are you'd forget your purpose before you realized you had succeeded. So each time you switched you risked losing access to the other.\n\nThat's when I also realized, **stalking** is used to hold your assemblage point in a new location!\n\nAnd it's inevitable.\n\nStalking will always be discovered by those who learn to move their assemblage points.\n\nWe've all merely been brainwashed by the ugly ordinary usage of that concept, in the Castaneda community.\n\nWhere you're just on an ego trip, pranking your friends.\n\nOr trying to justify nothing at all happening in your sorcery pursuits, because you never do real work.\n\nBy simply behaving in an excessive way.  Pretending to be changed.\n\nAnd calling that \"stalking\".\n\nWhen in fact if you understand the real purpose of stalking, it's possible to change into someone else fully and hold the assemblage point there.\n\nAnd it's not some imaginary or vague thing.\n\nYou really are someone else during the time you can manage to hold yourself at that new position.\n\nIt's very much related to cyclic being worlds.\n\nThey're kind of the same thing, except that cyclic being worlds involve real energy generating worlds.\n\nOr variations on this one. We don't know the answer to that for sure.\n\nWe get to see them.\n\nBut typically you don't see in detail how you got there. Or where it's located.\n\nWhereas just accidentally shifting your assemblage point far enough that you have new and odd motivations and opinions, isn't quite as \"stable\" as a cyclic being changeover.\n\nThus stalking.\n\nYou don't need stalking to hold your assemblage point in place in a cyclic being world.\n\nIn fact you want to avoid doing that, so you don't get stuck there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Assemblage Point Stuck In New Position", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Stalking"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"07v3isil0i2c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/07v3isil0i2c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b70f7d33c5142ae0a3846f4a813283530172836"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/07v3isil0i2c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7c4632775f16cab30919eefa29cf95629a7f7ab"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/07v3isil0i2c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c1b839ee082244951be07b9c7e8a18ee8cc16b1"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/07v3isil0i2c1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88a792e4451a742ad6844b9ae4d7e7330031a756"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/07v3isil0i2c1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f934a0aba79ebef7bbd5bd8ba2a1522b9a00e50"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/07v3isil0i2c1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed3295a5241596e2cd1507d8abf27b98f4633b32"}, "id": "07v3isil0i2c1"}}, "name": "t3_183k4f3", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Stalking", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Y4MHsYbn72Cl8IaYLovwywjJnlrp0c73dyFlz0_PoKg.jpg", "edited": 1700922290.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1700920081.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/07v3isil0i2c1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ed3295a5241596e2cd1507d8abf27b98f4633b32\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/07v3isil0i2c1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ed3295a5241596e2cd1507d8abf27b98f4633b32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My assemblage point got stuck in some odd position last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up at 10PM and looked at my social media on my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Woke up&amp;quot; is an exaggeration.

The fairy actually sort of emerged from one and kept jumping back into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The face, or the kinda light blue tiki mask, didn\u2019t emerge or didn\u2019t seem to be involved with the purple puffs. It just kinda popped up for a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it\u2019s interesting i don\u2019t believe the fairy was an intent disruption, it seemed way more flowing and alive. The face though I\u2019d like to be sure if I could classify it as an intent disruption, it didn\u2019t have vibrancy or presence like the fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could that be how you distinguish?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ih44uo/intent_disruption/g2ychwm/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_g2ychwm", "created": 1598476682.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1598476682.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]

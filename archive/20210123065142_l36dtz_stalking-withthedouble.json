Can&amp;#39;t darkroom gaze?  Try Zuleica&amp;#39;s other idea!  Both come from her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hunting for power everywhere leads to finding it!  That creates a connection to &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;, which is our goal.  It starts to &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; with you during the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagining doing martial arts on the floor, to bring the dreaming double out, works like a charm!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t imagine who could know that, if they couldn&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, the dreaming double coming out happens constantly while dark room gazing. It even comes out in pieces, with an extra arm here, a  head floating in the wrong place over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you can get the double to come out, the way Zuleica brought out Emilito, and if you can be present with it at the same time, you will find &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s in the middle as you travel between them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That book is the most significant we have. It&amp;#39;s a practical book, produced by women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The books of Carlos are male books, focused on tales of power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both are great, but after you get tired of running around fantasizing about power (and maybe  now have some of your own), you want practical techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are in that book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That book will open up a little fiery furnace door in front of you, behind which is the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/l36dtz/stalking_withthedouble/gkelp8r/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1611420984.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_l36dtz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gkmj4hu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "princejask", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1611517202.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gkmgdro", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_7zv7ysyk", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Too late", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gkmj4hu", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too late&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_l36dtz", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/l36dtz/stalking_withthedouble/gkmj4hu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1611517202.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gkmgdro", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Rsmentar", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1611515772.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_l36dtz", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_9yzdgacj", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Reading other books from this world may help develop what is of foremost importance, meaning awareness.

But could also become a squirrel.\n\nOr a fly.\n\nI sure hope not a skunk. I've been watching for skunk attacks lately. I hate to think that's Cholita, and not her ally Minx.\n\nA mistake beginners make is not realizing those puffs are a real thing, and just assuming it's some kind of light show.\n\nGazing at candles in other systems leads to that delusion. The \"after images\" technique.\n\nVery stupid.\n\nIt's like they're \"looking for their greatness\", hoping to see something, so they can run and tell their buddies and hopefully gain fame.\n\nThat's taught to everyone by outside systems, which are all pretending and attention seeking.\n\nWithout exception as far as we've found.\n\nSo let's say you're seriously doing darkroom, meaning \"Tensegrity in the Dark\".\n\nYou have all the elements going, as long as you emphasize silence, so that your fantasies in your mind aren't \"summoning\" our normal view of reality, where your energy body is blocked from sight.\n\nIf there's some light leakage into your darkroom, you could get away with closing your eyes.\n\nBut if you took that up as your practice, you wouldn't bring your double out into the real world.\n\n\"The Gaze\" directs where it goes, and you can't fool it.\n\nIf you \"gaze inward\" with closed eyes, it stays inward.\n\nThus it's sort of a complex question, for which I have no good analogy so far.\n\nWe used to be more tolerant of seeing other things besides the puffs, to help beginners feel motivated.\n\nBut then, they took advantage and we had all sorts of pretenders posting about \"whitish light\", which they misunderstood to be something you only perceive when the assemblage point passes the shapeshifting zone of the bottom, and comes up the front.\n\nSo \"whitish static\" is out.  As someone suggested, it's just \"a blue line effect\".\n\nGot to be the puffs or it's not your energy body, and the tensegrity is NOT working.\n\nDue to lack of internal silence.\n\nNow, up in the green zone, it's typical for actual sights of the puffs to be faint and disappointing.\n\nThe assemblage point just isn't yet low enough to \"tune in\" that aspect of reality.\n\nWhich brings up a very odd question for me.\n\nCholita's double is fully real looking to me.\n\nAnd it's made entirely out of her energy body.\n\nI'm convinced cats can perceive it. Thus we get neighborhood cats that are either obsessed with Cholita, or in a war with her.\n\nBad idea for the cats that get mixed up with battling her!\n\nThe last one met with an unfortunate \"truck accident\" that was so bizarre, the neighbors were laughing when they told me what they saw.\n\nBut the current cat seems to love Cholita, and is curious if I can do any tricks too.\n\nBut I can't...\n\nSo when I see Cholita in the kitchen, then look out the front door at the same time and see  her rushing down the street like she has urgent business, can any of the neighbors see her?\n\nWe just don't know!\n\nIt begs another question.\n\nWhen Elias, the teacher of don Juan's teacher, was in his double acting as a healer in northern Mexico, while he rested at home with his five wives, could anyone up north actually see him?\n\nOr did something have to be done, to move his patients into the green zone on the J curve?\n\nWe don't know yet.\n\nWell... Cholita knows.\n\nBut she's not talking.\n\nSo keep the eyes open until you easily see the puffs, and then if it's an emergency, you can squint or close them, to see something more closely.\n\nBut don't sit down and do that.  You'll go inward, have ordinary dreams, and confuse yourself.\n\nHaving small puffs, but definite ones, is a good thing!\n\nNow you have a \"micrometer\" for your silence levels!\n\nA measuring device.\n\nYou can test your silence, and also test how well you are doing the tensegrity, by observing if the puffs get brighter.\n\nAnd NEVER forget to stuff some puffs on the pouches.\n\nI always start out doing that, because later on it produces much better results.\n\nIt's like trying to teach a cat to do tricks.\n\nIf it's running around the room, you'll be far better off if you get it to come closer for a while, before you start asking for tricks.\n\nPeer pressure works on the double too.", "edited": 1691614333.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jvhrsmr", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyes closed is the same, as long as you stay awake and sharp.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you sit down and stop moving, you&amp;#39;ll drift towards sleeping dreaming, and mess up bringing out your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, he&amp;#39;ll bring you &amp;quot;in&amp;quot;.

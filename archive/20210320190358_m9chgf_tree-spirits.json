The belief even carries over into modern culture, such as with these \"Princess Mononoke Forest Spirit Elf Kodama Figures\".\n\nI used to think the idea of a tree spirit was misguided, and at the most it's just an inorganic being that someone noticed around a tree.\n\nIf it's not that, then probably it's just a product of a witch trying to move her own assemblage point by visualizing spirits she can use in a spell.\n\n(Which works by the way...)\n\nBut then Cholita ran away for a few weeks, which let me find the time at night to enjoy her little garden paradise. Most of my gazing is done in a dark room, with the doors locked for protection from Cholita.\n\nNormally if she found me sitting out here in her garden, I'd soon be unconscious. And maybe have to buy her a new laptop, because she prefers the hard aluminum case of the MacBook Pro, when she needs a handy bludgeoning object.\n\nI have yet to figure out what sort of a threat Cholita intends, with the laptop. To make me buy another one, or to give me a concussion?\n\nShe's famous at the Apple Store, for going catatonic during \"questioning\" (about her passwords on the old computer).\n\nSitting there, the last time Cholita was obviously gone and I had access, I forced my internal dialogue off to see what, \"Phantom Intent\" I could pick up from the local \"skimmings\". If that description puzzles you, go read the translated introduction to The Eagle's Gift, Spanish addition. Or do a lot of darkroom gazing until you realize how obvious that description really is.\n\nWhen you search for \"Phantom Intent\" in that manner, it's best to be asleep. But, at the same time, conscious. That's called, \"Sleep walking\" by most people, but for sorcerers it's known as \"Heightened Awareness\".\n\nFor famous Yogis like Maharshi and Muktananda, it's called, \"Cosmic Consciousness\" and indicates a base level of \"enlightenment\".\n\nYou've experienced something almost like that if you've tried at all to silence the internal dialogue, or have done even a small amount of gazing. Carlos used to have us make a little pole around 2 or 3 feet long, with padding on one end so we could rest our head on the pad while sitting cross legged, forcing silence. The other end of the pole goes between your feet, to hold it in place as you lean forward. What's comfortable determines the length.\n\nThat way, your chin won't fall forward onto your chest and jar you out of it when you doze off an instant while forcing silence. The dozing off is a good thing, as long as you return quickly! It teaches you to activate the second attention.\n\nIt is in fact, THE FASTEST WAY TO LEARN TO ACTIVATE THE SECOND ATTENTION, AND SHIFT THE ASSEMBLAGE POINT.\n\nIt's just that, no one ever takes it seriously enough. And they lie to themselves about their successes. So overall, darkroom gazing is superior.\n\nCarlos insisted we could learn to \"see\" that way, and in fact it worked in one Sunday class.\n\nYou're sitting there working hard on silence, and then suddenly you doze off.\n\nYou snap out of it, and curse yourself for your lack of concentration. But then, you remember that you had a very tiny dream while you were \"gone\".\n\nDon't ignore such things!!!! Ignoring small entries into the second attention is what makes nearly all who practice meditation never seem to get anywhere interesting. It's as if they are searching the woods for magical Elves, come to the Elf house, get a glimpse of the door, and then walk away. Saying to themselves, \"That's an odd door knob.\"\n\nSo sitting there in Cholita's garden, forcing silence, I dozed off for a split second. But being an advanced gazer, my head didn't even fall onto my chest. And I didn't lose consciousness.\n\nI simply \"came out of it\" remembering a Wasp, the size of a pony.\n\nA featureless one, solid dark grey, which is probably why they're also called, \"Shadow Beings\".\n\nIt was facing the largest plant in Cholita's garden, and was not moving at all. It seemed to be happy just to be next to that plant. As if the fragrance were so hypnotic, it didn't want to move.\n\nBut was it just a fast dream?\n\nI'll save you a lot of time and explain how to tell. You will see many types of visions if you do darkroom gazing, and over time you'll learn how to tell them apart.\n\nDreams come with backgrounds. Inorganic beings, at first, do not. They are simply a \"being\" in front of you. Over time, they might come with some \"props\", as you get more advanced.\n\nBut at first, if the Wasp/Pony had been a dream, I would have seen it in a pasture. Or on an amusement park horse ride for kids. I'd have seen the \"scene\" it belonged to.\n\nIf you see an isolated \"being\", that's an inorganic being.\n\nOr a \"Phantom skimming\" of one. That's more complicated.\n\nThe real question is, if you don't get too excited when you recall it, and start thinking about the amazing book you're going to write on tree spirits, or how flabbergasted your friend will be when you tell him you saw a genuine \"spirit\", then you can relax back into that dreaming awake state, and it will become visible again.  So can you get it to come back, is the important question to tell a dream from an inorganic being.\n\nAnd that's what happened with my tree spirit. I relaxed back into silence, and there it was. Grey, motionless, a giant Wasp, staring at Cholita's palm tree.\n\nShinzen Young has seen these beings. I wish I knew if he recounted it in a youtube video. I'd post a direct link to the time code. But essentially he said, after he reached Zen enlightenment he was walking along at a college, and saw insect-like giant beings along the sidewalk. I'm presuming, it was outdoors in a parklike setting, with large plants nearby.\n\nBeing a \"Chinese Zen Master\", he ignores magic. It's beneath him! But being Shinzen, he's happy to share if it helps others learn. That's the good thing about Shinzen. He spills the beans!\n\nWhich really just means, he actually has some beans.\n\nOther Zen masters do not. No beans to spill. And you'd better not ask, or the monks will mug you later on.\n\nBut even knowing about Shinzen's giant insects, I felt stupid for assuming I had seen an inorganic being who is more interested in a plant, than a human.\n\nUntil Taisha's new book surfaced. And somewhere in there, while teaching Taisha how to bring out the Double, Zuleica advises her to climb into a tree house, where tree spirits reside, in order to hold her assemblage point at the right position to bring out the double.\n\nWhen someone reported that to me (I'm still banned from reading any of those books on my own), I realized, I had in fact seen a tree spirit.\n\nAnd since Cholita is an inorganic being magnet, it wasn't surprising at all to find one in her garden. As far as I know, she might even have kidnapped it in a tree scented burlap bag, and put it there herself.\n\nThis makes Tree Spirits uniquely useful to sorcerers. They hang out in known locations, and apparently reliably. And perceiving any inorganic being can help to hold your assemblage point in position, once it moves below the green line on the J curve diagram. Meaning, when the assemblage point moves as low as below your shoulder blades, you can use inorganic beings to stabilize it there.\n\nBut the ordinary kind will want to play. As long as you can perceive them, you can hold your assemblage point in that position.\n\nBut if it's the type of inorganic being that likes humans, it won't last long at that position.\n\nThey'll try to move it sideways, so they can become more real, and even speak to you.\n\nHow does that go?\n\nThey'll say, \"Oh, look over there, at the pretty colored lights!\" Or, they'll just fly over there, so you notice them. And then somehow they get you interested in \"what on earth are those???\"\n\nAs you gaze, you shift horizontally.  You're assembling the \"skimmings\" available at that depth of the assemblage point.\n\nBut skimmings tend to move you sideways.\n\nThat's how it works. Left for spirituality, or insect energy. Right for physical activity, and beastly hellish visions.\n\nWhich is fine by me!\n\nBut if you're Zuleica (or Emilito), trying to teach Taisha, you just want it to stay where you helped her move it to.\n\nTree spirits seem to have no interest in humans, favoring plants. And so, they make very good tools for teaching sorcery.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Tree Spirits", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"hwlgoq8w28o61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 115, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hwlgoq8w28o61.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92e44a64538d774442f34cc0aa021fec5b79def0"}, {"y": 231, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hwlgoq8w28o61.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9643a6dd3f27a45843ac9366710981d4a6971c44"}, {"y": 342, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hwlgoq8w28o61.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19b187f8dfc1efb8b2a08da66850b04b450e27e8"}], "s": {"y": 500, "x": 467, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hwlgoq8w28o61.png?width=467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=613022447a7caa967beef3184651de62106d4af5"}, "id": "hwlgoq8w28o61"}}, "name": "t3_m9chgf", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_PCQK4vnsiglMgr8JbA3E-sVKoGuNOmx_25VLhebmjY.jpg", "edited": 1616267452.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1616263438.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hwlgoq8w28o61.png?width=467&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=613022447a7caa967beef3184651de62106d4af5\"&gt;Japanese Tree Spirit Collectables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do so many hunter/gatherer type social orders believe in the existence of &amp;quot;Tree Spirits&amp;quot;?

It&amp;#39;s not restricted to face to face fear involving the inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can do 4 gates dreaming, and stop when you succeed at the second gate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find an angry witch, and get her to &amp;quot;attack&amp;quot; you.  But it has to be a powerful one like Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a &amp;quot;wicca wonder&amp;quot; type.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which are still real witches. Just not real enough to have much dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe some Russian Necromancing witches would have enough. Ask if they visit cemetaries often, and if they summon the giant snake  demon.  But don&amp;#39;t lead them to say that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t like eastern bloc food, you can do a very detailed recapitulation. And when you get an IOB visitor, which is inevitable if you actually put in hours of work a night, do what it wants for a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can do darkroom gazing, and pull an IOB off a puff to become your assistant.  A good sign you&amp;#39;ve picked up some dark energy, is that the jet blackness becomes more interesting to you, than the purple light. Look for edges of purple burning with blue flames, against the jet black, with yellow hiding near by.  That&amp;#39;s a good sign, although I don&amp;#39;t know what you need to scoop, to get more of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best is if your IOB simply scares the bejesus out of you a few times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, you can sit around in silence where there&amp;#39;s a tree spirit, until you can visually perceive it. And then soak it up that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So please, no more whining about how I have Little Smoke, and you don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone did that for months.

I've seen it many times.\n\nShw was the moth swooping over the campfire.\n\nShe was the moth on the cover of several books.\n\nMaybe she got the gurgle from Genaro farting?\n\nI've certainly seen her moth form.

If you don&amp;#39;t have any experience with this topic besides the water cooler burping, that&amp;#39;s cool; I have thousands, and learning which are just synchronicity, which have meaning, and what the meaning is, is one way I stalk intent, and myself.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just call it a &amp;quot;not-doing&amp;quot;, and you&amp;#39;re good to go.\nI call it not-doing when I ignore the sounds and numbers completely for once, and just make decisions based solely on my own thoughts and feelings, as opposed to using feedback from the environment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is far more powerful than I am, and she&amp;#39;d readily agree with your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s good to hear, and what I was looking for - confirmation that this is part and parcel with nagualism, since it is such a major part of my practice. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_sj7eyk", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/sj7eyk/signs_language_using_numbers_to_communicate_with/hvi4au9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1643938627.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hvgy24w", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1643921616.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_sj7eyk", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Those \"agreements\" were little smoke.

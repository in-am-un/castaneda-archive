Since Cholita \"rescued\" me.\n\nI'm still trying to figure out where she got that corridor.  It still lingers, and when I gaze at it I realize Cholita only found it there.  She didn't make it.  \n\nIt runs from south to north.  Don't know if that's significant.\n\nLately I seem to be so spoiled, I wasn't thinking what I did last night was worth drawing up.\n\nBut reading around this morning I realized, \"Draw it or lose it!\"\n\nIf you did this every single night for 20 years, each time doing more and more, and then stopped, in a year it would all be gone.\n\nI don't know how that works but likely it just means, we ARE the position of our assemblage point.\n\nAnd at the normal one, you just can't do things like this.\n\nI've been trying to rescue the shamanism subreddit lately, but it's controlled by mostly bad men.\n\nBecause everyone is too afraid to stand up to bullies.  \n\nTheir only interest is hurting and dominating others.\n\nThey even managed to brainwash a few into thinking that's what sorcerers do.  \"Tricksters\" is their excuse.\n\nA trickster sorcerer!\n\nExcept, that really means, a bad player.  Who has nothing to offer, can't do any sorcery, so they harm others in order to seem to dominate the situation.\n\nAnd call themselves, \"tricksters\".\n\nWe had them in private classes.  Basically, the ones Carlos had to toss out.\n\nI think they went back to pulling wings off flies.\n\nBut real sorcerers do what you see above, and 1000 times more.\n\nOnce you can do  that you don't sit at your computer in your underwear, trying to hurt other people.\n\nEven if you're a really bad person, you still wouldn't do that.  Because any interaction you have with another person, ties you to that person.  Like an anchor.\n\nIt prevents the assemblage point from moving, which prevents magic.\n\nIt's why we recap.\n\nSo if you run around fussing to make up for your horrible life, you only keep yourself trapped even more deeply by attacking others.\n\nI had to give up on the shamanism subreddit.\n\nI suppose it was inevitable.  No active mods there who are capable of figuring out who's helpful, and who's simply evil, mentally ill, or of extremely low IQ.\n\nBut even those could learn in secret, on the side.\n\nIf they could just be honest with themselves.\n\nI suppose...\n\nNope.\n\nBy the way, I had Cholita's help on what I did last night.

But I don&amp;#39;t have a better word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe, a window slides open, and you can she through it to find  yourself also on the other side?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You just want to fall asleep, but...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as you&amp;#39;re sitting, that&amp;#39;s ok.  Your head will fall forward, you chin hit your chest, adn it&amp;#39;ll be too painful to stay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;then you try to catch the head just as it falls.  That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;sweet spot&amp;quot; of second attention activity for a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, laying down you&amp;#39;ll go into dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan said that kind of dreaming is &amp;quot;always&amp;quot; real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beats me what that means.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Maybe only silence works a bit differently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence makes it possible for the assemblage point to move, because you aren&amp;#39;t directing your beam of awareness onto the ME spot between your toes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a very specific claim, and other things can also be going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But essentially, any thought you have in words, is a command for that beam of awareness to look a certain direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence allows it to move, and then with nothing to focus on, the assemblage point can drift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No obsession, assemblage point is free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, it doesn&amp;#39;t have any where to move to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No force directing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you need to find &amp;quot;something coming from the second attention&amp;quot;, if you want it to move the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just silence, plus nothing to look at, usually results in horizontal shifts, the easiest thing you can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A familiar thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So laying in silence on the bed, you can often get into weird &amp;quot;feverish dreams&amp;quot;, absent the illness of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as, you find that you&amp;#39;re a blueish marble in a tube, rolling down wards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, you thought you heard a voice say, &amp;quot;When the lines get that thick, you have to...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absent any direction, you get random movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That can be &amp;quot;assisted&amp;quot; by distorting the shape of the luminous shell, through good habits. Like not dwelling on &amp;quot;ME&amp;quot; during the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That flattens the egg a bit, so when your assemblage point slides without purpose, it can go further, and remain longer, well enough to get a better look around.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_pij28q", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pij28q/readers_of_infinity_save_magic/hbt9edt/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1630938961.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1630938961.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hbryi7d", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "tabdrops", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hbqm369", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_b9puh3b5", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "This kinda silence is my favorite practice.

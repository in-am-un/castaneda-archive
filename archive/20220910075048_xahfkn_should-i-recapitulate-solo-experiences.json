A corrupt dark force managing prostitution and corrupting local governments with huge real estate deals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And why they get away over here, with such egotistical teachings. We don&amp;#39;t realize the truth of their religion. And western bad players have &amp;quot;sanitised&amp;quot; buddhism to make it seem real over here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We fall for it hook, line, and sinker, because it promises to give us &amp;quot;endorsed attention&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way Tony Karim was seduced away from leading us, by the big fake smile Dali Lama.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to &amp;quot;lose the self&amp;quot; for real simply means, you move so far past our normal perceptions of reality that you no longer want do &amp;quot;defend yourself&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We constantly go around with a giant chip on our shoulder, waiting to protect our image among others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An image of a being that doesn&amp;#39;t really exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re the toddler learning he has to fight back, to get his fair share of cookies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if his older brother pinches him, he has to howl loudly or else things will escalate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you move to the deep orange, that&amp;#39;s all gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You reach &amp;quot;the place of no pity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mostly no self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you no longer believe yourself to be that helpless toddler trying to keep up with the older people around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The breath even changes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#39;re totally lost when we start out to learn sorcery, dwelling in cities, living in rooms, in nuclear families.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That has really made this self-pity thing dominate in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t nearly this bad in the state we evolved to live in.

Not a thing.\n\nIt all becomes possible, once you can move your assemblage point there.\n\nThe recap gets you back energy so that it rises above the knees, where the \"layers\" become visible.  The shiny outer coating.\n\nI suspect that's what makes advanced recap work. The shiny outer coating of the egg.\n\nBut no one ever filled us in on those details.\n\nInstead, we just have stories, and it's our duty to duplicate those.\n\nNot the first 3 books though.

She handed me a silver mercury dime to help me remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, I had to go to multiple stores and look at every single item to see if I could find more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I finished that list I went to visit every single place I&amp;#39;d ever lived, every school I&amp;#39;d attended, even walking down the roads I&amp;#39;d used there, to see the junk on the sides of the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I eventually finished that, and bought a small travel dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;#39;t like a giant Webster&amp;#39;s dictionary, but it had any word you might think of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started at the As, and went over every single word, looking for more memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made it to the Ms, before I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was an impossible task.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a problem!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Silent Knowledge, the memories will point themselves out to you, with a very entertaining show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be panning the head back and forth slowly, breathing the way you are supposed to, and a sparkle in the void will catch your eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll see that you have a strand of light stretching off towards it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you notice that, a monitor will light up in the distance, playing a rerun of the memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can &amp;quot;zip&amp;quot; into those and relive the event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally Carlos told us all about this, but everyone glossed over it.  As if that were too absurd to be a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which makes it very odd we don&amp;#39;t hear about this, from the people who claim to be following the recap and Tensegrity path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess: They lie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there&amp;#39;s nothing to learn in sorcery!  Not a thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all becomes possible, once you can move your assemblage point there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The recap gets you back energy so that it rises above the knees, where the &amp;quot;layers&amp;quot; become visible.  The shiny outer coating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect that&amp;#39;s what makes advanced recap work. The shiny outer coating of the egg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no one ever filled us in on those details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, we just have stories, and it&amp;#39;s our duty to duplicate those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the first 3 books though. That&amp;#39;s for bad player Men of Knowledge types.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/xahfkn/should_i_recapitulate_solo_experiences/inuy00a/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1662820163.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_xahfkn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 21}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "inwouyn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Agitated_Direction17", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_inw2yso", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_rkgy103u", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "true, very true, thank you", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_inwouyn", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;true, very true, thank you&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_xahfkn", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/xahfkn/should_i_recapitulate_solo_experiences/inwouyn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1662845777.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1662845777.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "inw2yso", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Muted_Claim2590", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_invb2hj", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_1slwxjf", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Sounds like you did a splendid job!

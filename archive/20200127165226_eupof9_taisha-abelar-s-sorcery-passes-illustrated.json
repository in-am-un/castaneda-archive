[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "The Nagualist Newsletter and Open Forum / Issue 2 August / September 1994 (edited, and with added descriptions from the book \"The Sorcerer's Crossing\" by Taisha Abelar):\n\nA few readers have written that the sorcery passes were emphasized in seminars as a way to harness the energy gathered in the recapitulation. Carlos' group does seem to be emphasizing them, since they are taught at the end of their seminars. This suggests that everyone interested in the recapitulation ought to consider doing the passes.\n\nThe descriptions in the books are very detailed, but in fact they are not logically exclusive. There are possible conflicting interpretations on what's written. Since most of our readers have not been invited to a seminar, we hope to build visual representations of the information seminar attendees are receiving. We started this project too late in the development of this issue to receive input from readers. To get the ball rolling, we hired an artist to make the representations shown. They are accurate representations of our own interpretation of the text of Taisha's book. They should not be taken as the correct way to do these passes. We suspect that the passes may be like the recapitulation; the *intent* is the important part, the details can be personalized.\n\n**Sorcery passes from** **The Shamans' Crossing** **by Taisha Abelar:**\n\n[illustration 01](https://preview.redd.it/qz3fn2wt8cd41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0070a98f128b0b2e34001ab2898a027f29e33b1)\n\nFrom the start of chapter 10.  Is the forehead stroked in any particular direction (clockwise / counterclockwise)? Does one flick both hands in the air or only the left? How exactly are the wrist and fingers flicked?\n\nFrom the book:\n\n\"Clara sat on the rattan armchair at the edge of the patio, brushing her shiny black hair. Then she arranged it with her fingers until everything was in place. When she had finished grooming herself, she brought her left palm to her forehead and stroked it in a circular fashion. Then she moved her hand over the top of her head and down the back of her neck, after which she flicked her wrists and fingers in the air. She repeated this stroking and flicking sequence several more times.\n\nI was fascinated watching her movements. There was nothing careless or haphazard about them. She performed them with intense concentration, as if she were engaged in a most important task.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked, breaking the silence. \"Are you giving yourself some sort of a facial massage?\"\n\nClara glanced over at me, sitting on the matching armchair, imitating her movements.\n\nShe said, \"This circular stroking prevents wrinkles from forming on the forehead. It may appear like a facial massage to you, but it isn't. These are sorcery passes; movements of the hand that are designed to gather energy for a specific purpose.\"\n\n\"What specific purpose is that?\" I asked, flicking my wrists the way she had done.\n\n\"The purpose of these sorcery passes is to keep one looking youthful by preventing wrinkles from forming,\" she said. \"The purpose has been decided beforehand, not by me or by you, but by power itself.\"\"\n\n[illustration 02](https://preview.redd.it/bzg6wqu2acd41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b75e46d698cae00f7e7b687f43441405538b5390)\n\nFrom the 3rd page of chapter 10. How is the thumb rubbed (circular, straight)? How long is it rubbed? Does one stroke several times after each thumb rub or only once? Are the hand positions shown here correct? Update from the next issue of NN: \"We received input for the sorcery pass diagram project we started in the last issue. One piece of input was from a reader who had his own personal interpretation of the pass where the thumbs are rubbed together and then stroked above the eyebrows. He said that he manipulates his hands so that he can rub both thumbs together at the same time. Interestingly enough, our artist, who had never read Taisha's book before, originally drew them that way on her own. We asked her to change them (the illustration above reflects this update). These interpretations are personal however, neither of these parties has been instructed by a member of Carlos' group. I tried it and liked it better than my own way of doing it.\"\n\nFrom the book:\n\n\"...she vigorously rubbed each thumb on the palm of the opposite hand and placed them on the bridge of her nose. She moved them outward with light, even strokes over her eyebrows to the temples.\n\n\"This pass will keep furrows from developing between your eyebrows,\" she explained.\n\n[illustration 03](https://preview.redd.it/noglptaqacd41.jpg?width=314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=628677b119b2c8d1fa2fc5206d82e3aa2ccfc123)\n\nFrom the 3rd page of chapter 10. Is the rubbing shown here correct? Which part of the finger is rubbed? Does one brush a single time per finger rubbing or multiple times? Anything else shown incorrectly?\n\nFrom the book:\n\n\"After quickly rubbing together her index fingers, like two sticks starting a fire, she brought them vertically to each side of her nose and gently moved them sideways over her cheeks several times.\"\n\n\"That's to clear the sinus cavities,\" she said, deliberately constricting her nasal passages. \"Instead of picking your nose, do this movement.\"\n\n[illustration 04](https://preview.redd.it/i92wf7uzacd41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e71f4ffb53d3134b0e74c9ee28691e78e7a280d)\n\nFrom the 3rd page of chapter 10. Is the rubbing shown here correct? Anything else wrong with this representation?\n\nFrom the book:\n\n\"\"The next pass is to keep the cheeks from sagging,\" she said.\n\nShe briskly rubbed her palms together, and with long, firm strokes, she slid them up each cheek to her temples. She repeated this movement six or seven times, always using slow, even, upward strokes.\n\nI noticed her face was flushed, but she didn't stop yet.\"\n\n[illustration 05](https://preview.redd.it/3p8nxezebcd41.jpg?width=283&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb7b5bd93089ac6130b6f30c06de3884b9a11b9d)\n\nFrom the 3rd page of chapter 10. Which part of the finger is used? Any other corrections?\n\nFrom the book:\n\n\"She placed the inner edge of her hand with her thumb folded over her palm above her upper lip, and rubbed back and forth with a vigorous saw-like motion.\n\nShe explained that the spot where the nose and upper lip join, when briskly rubbed, stimulates energy to flow in mild, even bursts.\"\n\n[illustration 06](https://preview.redd.it/rgu37hjoccd41.jpg?width=277&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f7be8fb4cbbb8078515ddf123100581de4cf3fd)\n\nFrom the 3rd page of chapter 10. Is this the correct point? How is it pricked?\n\nFrom the book:\n\n\"But if greater bursts of energy were needed, they could be obtained by pricking the point at the center of the upper gum underneath the upper lip and below the nose septum.\n\n\"If you get drowsy in the cave while recapitulating, rub this point briskly, and it will temporarily revive you,\" she said.\n\nI rubbed my upper lip and felt my nose and ears clear. I also experienced a slight numbing sensation on the roof of my palate. It lasted for a few seconds but took my breath away. It left me with the sensation that I was just about to uncover something that was veiled.\"\n\n[illustration 07](https://preview.redd.it/adof32x1dcd41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79f48addf12e2efdb2e6d17a51951a33976989cc)\n\nFrom the 4th page of chapter 10. Which part of the hand rubs the chin and is the image shown correct? Update from the next issue of NN: \"A reader, who had attended the lectures and had received personal instruction on the passes, sent in a correction to the pass on the lower right of page 4 in issue 2. We decided to print an exact copy of her letter in order to show that the diagrams used to advise us on the passes need not be complex. We have lots of readers with knowledge of the passes and we want them to know that corrections need not be elaborate. The corrections scribbled on her letter are perfect.\" [\\[Reader Submitted Diagram\\]](https://i.redd.it/3ytt28pqjld41.jpg)\n\nFrom the book:\n\n\"Next, Clara moved her index fingers sideways under her chin, again using a quick back-and-forth saw-like motion. She explained that stimulating the point under the chin produces a calm alertness.\"\n\n[illustration 08](https://preview.redd.it/wz03tr7edcd41.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcde6c9dc5f76447be2202cf4c0bd78d3d3d5f50)\n\nFrom the 4th page of chapter 10. Is the sitting position important? Is this representation correct?\n\nFrom the book:\n\n\"She added that we can also activate this point by resting the chin on a low table while sitting on the floor.\n\nFollowing her suggestion, I moved my cushion to the floor and sat on it, and rested my chin on a wooden crate that was just level with my face. By leaning forward, I put a slight pressure on that chin point Clara had indicated. After a few moments, I felt my body settle down: A prickling sensation rose up my back, entered my head, and my breathing became deeper and more rhythmic.\"\n\n[illustration 09](https://preview.redd.it/5i5ekvmtdcd41.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23ede095c26572c41deae2f9ad8b6abef9559353)\n\nFrom the book, 4th page of chapter 10:\n\n\"\"Another way to awake the center under the chin,\" Clara continued, \"is by lying on the stomach with the hands in fists, one on top of the other, under the chin.\"\n\nShe recommended that when doing the exercise with the fists, we should tense them to create pressure under the chin and then relax them to release the pressure. Tensing and relaxing the fists, she said, produces a pulsating movement that sends small bursts of energy to a vital center directly connected with the base of the tongue.\n\nShe stressed that this exercise should be done cautiously, otherwise one might develop a sore throat.\n\nI went to sit in the rattan chair again.\n\n\"This group of sorcery passes I've shown you,\" Clara continued, \"must be practiced daily until they cease to be massage-like movements and become what they really are: sorcery passes.\n\n\"Watch me!\" she ordered.\n\nI saw her repeat the movements she had shown me, except that this time she was making her fingers and hands dance. Her hands seemed at times to penetrate deeply into the skin of her face. At other times, her hands passed over it lightly; as if gliding on the skin's surface; and moving so rapidly that they seemed to disappear.\n\nWatching her exquisite movements kept me mesmerized.\n\n\"This way of stroking was never in your inventory,\" she laughed when she had finished. \"This is sorcery. It requires an intent different from the intent of the daily world.\"\n\n\"With all the tension that rises to the face, we certainly need a different intent if we are going to relax the muscles and tone the centers located there.\"\n\nClara said that all our emotions leave traces on our face more than on any other part of our body. Therefore we have to release accumulated stress using the sorcery passes and their accompanying intent.\n\nShe stared at me for a moment and remarked, \"I see from the tension in your face that you've been pondering over your recapitulation. \"Be sure to do your passes before going to bed tonight to remove those creases in your forehead.\"\n\nI admitted that I had been worrying about my recapitulation.\n\n\"The problem is that you are spending too much time in the cave,\" Clara said with a wink. \"I don't want you turning into a bat-girl.\"\n\n\"By now I think you've gathered enough energy to start learning other things.\"\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n[Nagualist Newsletter and Open Forum / Issue 2 Aug. /Sept.

We suspect that the passes may be like the recapitulation; the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; is the important part, the details can be personalized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorcery passes from&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Shamans&amp;#39; Crossing&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;by Taisha Abelar:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qz3fn2wt8cd41.jpg?width=400&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c0070a98f128b0b2e34001ab2898a027f29e33b1\"&gt;illustration 01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the start of chapter 10.  Is the forehead stroked in any particular direction (clockwise / counterclockwise)? Does one flick both hands in the air or only the left? How exactly are the wrist and fingers flicked?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the book:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Clara sat on the rattan armchair at the edge of the patio, brushing her shiny black hair. Then she arranged it with her fingers until everything was in place. When she had finished grooming herself, she brought her left palm to her forehead and stroked it in a circular fashion. Then she moved her hand over the top of her head and down the back of her neck, after which she flicked her wrists and fingers in the air. She repeated this stroking and flicking sequence several more times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated watching her movements. There was nothing careless or haphazard about them. She performed them with intense concentration, as if she were engaged in a most important task.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you doing?&amp;quot; I asked, breaking the silence. &amp;quot;Are you giving yourself some sort of a facial massage?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clara glanced over at me, sitting on the matching armchair, imitating her movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;This circular stroking prevents wrinkles from forming on the forehead. It may appear like a facial massage to you, but it isn&amp;#39;t. These are sorcery passes; movements of the hand that are designed to gather energy for a specific purpose.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What specific purpose is that?&amp;quot; I asked, flicking my wrists the way she had done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The purpose of these sorcery passes is to keep one looking youthful by preventing wrinkles from forming,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;The purpose has been decided beforehand, not by me or by you, but by power itself.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bzg6wqu2acd41.jpg?width=400&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b75e46d698cae00f7e7b687f43441405538b5390\"&gt;illustration 02&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the 3rd page of chapter 10. How is the thumb rubbed (circular, straight)? How long is it rubbed? Does one stroke several times after each thumb rub or only once? Are the hand positions shown here correct? Update from the next issue of NN: &amp;quot;We received input for the sorcery pass diagram project we started in the last issue. One piece of input was from a reader who had his own personal interpretation of the pass where the thumbs are rubbed together and then stroked above the eyebrows. He said that he manipulates his hands so that he can rub both thumbs together at the same time. Interestingly enough, our artist, who had never read Taisha&amp;#39;s book before, originally drew them that way on her own. We asked her to change them (the illustration above reflects this update). These interpretations are personal however, neither of these parties has been instructed by a member of Carlos&amp;#39; group. I tried it and liked it better than my own way of doing it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the book:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...she vigorously rubbed each thumb on the palm of the opposite hand and placed them on the bridge of her nose. She moved them outward with light, even strokes over her eyebrows to the temples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This pass will keep furrows from developing between your eyebrows,&amp;quot; she explained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/noglptaqacd41.jpg?width=314&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=628677b119b2c8d1fa2fc5206d82e3aa2ccfc123\"&gt;illustration 03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the 3rd page of chapter 10. Is the rubbing shown here correct? Which part of the finger is rubbed? Does one brush a single time per finger rubbing or multiple times? Anything else shown incorrectly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the book:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;After quickly rubbing together her index fingers, like two sticks starting a fire, she brought them vertically to each side of her nose and gently moved them sideways over her cheeks several times.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s to clear the sinus cavities,&amp;quot; she said, deliberately constricting her nasal passages. &amp;quot;Instead of picking your nose, do this movement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i92wf7uzacd41.jpg?width=400&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0e71f4ffb53d3134b0e74c9ee28691e78e7a280d\"&gt;illustration 04&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the 3rd page of chapter 10. Is the rubbing shown here correct? Anything else wrong with this representation?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the book:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;The next pass is to keep the cheeks from sagging,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She briskly rubbed her palms together, and with long, firm strokes, she slid them up each cheek to her temples. She repeated this movement six or seven times, always using slow, even, upward strokes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed her face was flushed, but she didn&amp;#39;t stop yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3p8nxezebcd41.jpg?width=283&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cb7b5bd93089ac6130b6f30c06de3884b9a11b9d\"&gt;illustration 05&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the 3rd page of chapter 10. Which part of the finger is used? Any other corrections?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the book:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She placed the inner edge of her hand with her thumb folded over her palm above her upper lip, and rubbed back and forth with a vigorous saw-like motion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She explained that the spot where the nose and upper lip join, when briskly rubbed, stimulates energy to flow in mild, even bursts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rgu37hjoccd41.jpg?width=277&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5f7be8fb4cbbb8078515ddf123100581de4cf3fd\"&gt;illustration 06&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the 3rd page of chapter 10. Is this the correct point? How is it pricked?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the book:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But if greater bursts of energy were needed, they could be obtained by pricking the point at the center of the upper gum underneath the upper lip and below the nose septum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you get drowsy in the cave while recapitulating, rub this point briskly, and it will temporarily revive you,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rubbed my upper lip and felt my nose and ears clear. I also experienced a slight numbing sensation on the roof of my palate. It lasted for a few seconds but took my breath away. It left me with the sensation that I was just about to uncover something that was veiled.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/adof32x1dcd41.jpg?width=400&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=79f48addf12e2efdb2e6d17a51951a33976989cc\"&gt;illustration 07&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the 4th page of chapter 10. Which part of the hand rubs the chin and is the image shown correct? Update from the next issue of NN: &amp;quot;A reader, who had attended the lectures and had received personal instruction on the passes, sent in a correction to the pass on the lower right of page 4 in issue 2. We decided to print an exact copy of her letter in order to show that the diagrams used to advise us on the passes need not be complex. We have lots of readers with knowledge of the passes and we want them to know that corrections need not be elaborate. The corrections scribbled on her letter are perfect.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/3ytt28pqjld41.jpg\"&gt;[Reader Submitted Diagram]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the book:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Next, Clara moved her index fingers sideways under her chin, again using a quick back-and-forth saw-like motion. She explained that stimulating the point under the chin produces a calm alertness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wz03tr7edcd41.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bcde6c9dc5f76447be2202cf4c0bd78d3d3d5f50\"&gt;illustration 08&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the 4th page of chapter 10. Is the sitting position important? Is this representation correct?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the book:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She added that we can also activate this point by resting the chin on a low table while sitting on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following her suggestion, I moved my cushion to the floor and sat on it, and rested my chin on a wooden crate that was just level with my face. By leaning forward, I put a slight pressure on that chin point Clara had indicated. After a few moments, I felt my body settle down: A prickling sensation rose up my back, entered my head, and my breathing became deeper and more rhythmic.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5i5ekvmtdcd41.jpg?width=400&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=23ede095c26572c41deae2f9ad8b6abef9559353\"&gt;illustration 09&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the book, 4th page of chapter 10:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Another way to awake the center under the chin,&amp;quot; Clara continued, &amp;quot;is by lying on the stomach with the hands in fists, one on top of the other, under the chin.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She recommended that when doing the exercise with the fists, we should tense them to create pressure under the chin and then relax them to release the pressure. Tensing and relaxing the fists, she said, produces a pulsating movement that sends small bursts of energy to a vital center directly connected with the base of the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stressed that this exercise should be done cautiously, otherwise one might develop a sore throat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to sit in the rattan chair again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This group of sorcery passes I&amp;#39;ve shown you,&amp;quot; Clara continued, &amp;quot;must be practiced daily until they cease to be massage-like movements and become what they really are: sorcery passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Watch me!&amp;quot; she ordered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw her repeat the movements she had shown me, except that this time she was making her fingers and hands dance. Her hands seemed at times to penetrate deeply into the skin of her face. At other times, her hands passed over it lightly; as if gliding on the skin&amp;#39;s surface; and moving so rapidly that they seemed to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching her exquisite movements kept me mesmerized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This way of stroking was never in your inventory,&amp;quot; she laughed when she had finished. &amp;quot;This is sorcery. It requires an intent different from the intent of the daily world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With all the tension that rises to the face, we certainly need a different intent if we are going to relax the muscles and tone the centers located there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clara said that all our emotions leave traces on our face more than on any other part of our body. Therefore we have to release accumulated stress using the sorcery passes and their accompanying intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stared at me for a moment and remarked, &amp;quot;I see from the tension in your face that you&amp;#39;ve been pondering over your recapitulation. &amp;quot;Be sure to do your passes before going to bed tonight to remove those creases in your forehead.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I admitted that I had been worrying about my recapitulation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The problem is that you are spending too much time in the cave,&amp;quot; Clara said with a wink. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want you turning into a bat-girl.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;By now I think you&amp;#39;ve gathered enough energy to start learning other things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sustainedaction.org/_nagualist/_nnl2/contents.htm\"&gt;Nagualist Newsletter and Open Forum / Issue 2 Aug. /Sept. 1994&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20001210150100/http://www.sustainedaction.org/_nagualist/_nnl2/Passes.htm\"&gt;[Backup]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Tuzyy4-7kAdQunGv1AzUpusMR1d0wnLrE-FE2r_B8kk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=8a3ab6f37911e346390619459e55d828ac01a2b9", "width": 500, "height": 328}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Tuzyy4-7kAdQunGv1AzUpusMR1d0wnLrE-FE2r_B8kk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b947ba74a7b8d8677be85b09842064ace9573d9e", "width": 108, "height": 70}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Tuzyy4-7kAdQunGv1AzUpusMR1d0wnLrE-FE2r_B8kk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01f9ef1bf2f29326281e9785b2d4a6702b3130bf", "width": 216, "height": 141}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/Tuzyy4-7kAdQunGv1AzUpusMR1d0wnLrE-FE2r_B8kk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=652898bfe8f80079ff17b162be533ceed99db1c6", "width": 320, "height": 209}], "variants": {}, "id": "Zt3tBV-aMDct3MujdgJu5l2OpVPujJ7Q6RkyjELl8wg"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "c812fe20-6005-11ea-a726-0e9c39b3b989", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "num_reports": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "eupof9", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 3, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/eupof9/taisha_abelars_sorcery_passes_illustrated/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/eupof9/taisha_abelars_sorcery_passes_illustrated/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1580140346.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ffqwchg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "jd198703", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1580145128.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_eupof9", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3tl0tnl8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Good stuff!

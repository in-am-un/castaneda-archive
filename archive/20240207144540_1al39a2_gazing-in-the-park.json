like waves\nafter some colors made their appearance very quickly like small lightnings mainly blue color but also yellow and green far away in the trees.\nmy back hurt from the position I was sitting and so I started massaging the glands around the shoulder blades and then the infinity breath passes\nwhen I feel better after that I saw a purple puff on my left, quite bright\nI watched the puff go

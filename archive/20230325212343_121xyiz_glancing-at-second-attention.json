Or represent them as a single thing to fuss about.\n\nAppraise or dismiss instantly as a group.\n\nPossibly mostly because of an excessive internal dialogue causing us not to pay very much attention to what's really happening around us.\n\nIt's almost as if muscle memory has fully taken us over, and we're just zombies without purpose.\n\nBut it's also much like the dreamer, walking around with no tonal rationality.\n\nJust wandering in endless phantom dream realms.\n\nI'll have to cartoon it!\n\nThe odd thing is, some \"magical\" systems are actually catered to glossers.\n\nSo that when I get pointed to one of those subreddit types, I find some common behavior.\n\nA glosser obsessed with one of those \"glosser's appealing\" systems, such as alchemy, will come in to this subreddit and claim they don't see anything different.\n\nNo obvious magic.\n\nIf you point out the magic to them, even showing it has a historical content,  they claim it's just me making stuff up.\n\nIgnoring all the back and forth conversations with people actually learning the same things I post about.  And the occasional post by someone else, with equally cool real magic.  Which always has the burden of learning drawing software or it would be far more common.\n\nThey just blow over the fact that there's dozens kicking the Buddha's delusional butt in here.\n\nOr that we're obviously playing with real live spirits, when doing that makes you a saint in fake magical  systems.\n\nDoesn't count to the glossers, who are after something else they won't admit even to themselves.\n\nNot magic.\n\nProbably money and fame.

I only remember the women in private class teasing her that she needed to do that, to gift people who work hard with magic.\n\nA not so obvious example is the J curve.  Carlos claimed 2 women had moved their assemblage points all the way along that path, and so he was teaching us about it.  And immediately after, he put them up on stage as the new workshop leaders.\n\nThe women looked mystified when he mentioned their \"accomplishment\".\n\nLike they had no idea what he was talking about.\n\nIt's certainly true that they might have done that by accident and either not remember it, or not realize what had happened.  Maybe they had a few visions, but to get stupendous magic all around you might take going there a few times.  There's so much you can choose to focus on in heightened awareness, you might not focus on something memorable.\n\nFor example, Carlos was focused on drinking coffee against don Juan's wishes, in a recent inspirational quote.    While it full on heightened awareness. As don Juan said, all participants have to be in that state, to take advantage of it.  If it's just one person, you can still behave like the idiot you always are.\n\nBut it's also possible Carlos introduced that J curve because he was dying.  And the women were just the \"presenters\".\n\nThe J curve is a dangerous thing to know about, and you'll realize that if you learn to move all the way along the curve.  Most will never learn to move along it, because it takes more work than they are willing to put out.\n\nBut it's the key to all magic humans can do.  And unknown in any other system.\n\nCould be, his time was up, so he pushed some women out there to borrow their energy for introducing that dangerous knowledge.\n\nIt's the alternative to the Nagual's blow!  Nothing could be more significant.\n\nAnd the Chacmools were used to introduce Tensegrity.  None of them had any particular magic abilities.  Most still don't.\n\nThe fliers were introduced, also using a small group of women.  Carlos held up the picture, and claimed one of the women had taken the shot in their last visit to Mexico.\n\nWhich she clearly hadn't. It was a cheesy old UFO picture from a TV show of the period. It's still out there all over the web, under other explanations.\n\nIf you consider the normal procedure to duplicate a sorcery lineage, the old nagual starts it by gathering 8 women first, each selected to have a different kind of energy.\n\nI tried the same myself, around 8 years ago.\n\nThen the old Nagual finds a new male Nagual who is allowed to make use of the women as their leader.\n\nIf you've been in here a while, you'll realize how crazy it would be to take 8 random people and try to use them to help another learn sorcery.\n\nEach one a nightmare, as we see in here with new people.\n\nHow is that going to help a male Nagual?  To have 8 new self-pity mongers to take care of.\n\nIt's their energy!\n\nEven if they don't know it, all women are witches.\n\nIf you want to accomplish something impossible, which you can't practice or prepare for,  you're better off surrounded by 8 energetic women,  than having no one around.\n\nThere are also \"inspirational quotes\" on the topic in the books. At least 2.\n\nOne is that men use the energy of women to make changes in their life all the time.  Like a middle aged man getting  a very young girlfriend, and then rearranging his life to please her more.\n\nAnd then there's a quote from one of the women's books, but I'll leave it to any inventory experts reading this who can remember it, to point it out. I suspect there are even more.\n\nMale sorcerers use the energy of women, to *intend* things.\n\nAnd they can use their dark energy, to move their assemblage points. Everything became twice as easy for me, the day Cholita moved into my house.  Her dark energy flowed into my dark room like a very visible fog illuminated with purple light.\n\nAnd the women don't even have to have sorcery knowledge, to help a male sorcerer.\n\nJust a good level of energy.\n\nPossibly mostly dark energy.\n\nCarlos took criticism for his handling of women in the inner circle.\n\nIt wasn't warranted.\n\nHe was behaving like a sorcerer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Something to pay attention to: How Carlos introduced magic through Women.", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ltsfbx", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1614446544.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1614445564.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may not be obvious, but a male sorcerer can use the energy of Women, without them actually knowing what he&amp;#39;s doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most famously, Carlos pushed Carol Tiggs up on stage, and had her do &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; for people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case, she pushed me back into the inorganic being&amp;#39;s tunnel, and I got to keep that permanently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what others experienced, but Carlos was essentially &amp;quot;borrowing&amp;quot; the energy of Carol, and using his &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; to give it purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never saw it myself, but I&amp;#39;m told Carol jokingly used a bullwhip over an audience.

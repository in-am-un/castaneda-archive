It's exactly 3 weeks I'm meditating in the darkroom. I can write up a lot, though I'd be short this time.\n\nIt started with me seeing nothing in the darkness at all, not even swirls or any fog I can see in the light in just a few mins. On day 3 I started to see them coming back. First week was spent mostly making the body comfortable and used to the practice. By the end of the first week, all the waves and swirls disappeared again, though the reddish veil stayed.\n\nAfter that I saw that color (not too bright but certainly there) all the time. I'd call it orange red. With time I came to conclusion this is my own energy. No swirls and waves, just very steady and stable veil. I kept watching it trying to make it to purple or blue. Somewhere in the second week I started \"Inhaling\" the red light, Inhale/pull it in, Exhale/keep it inside.\n\nAfter some time that lead to the red light to disappear (though if I look down it's there, like if I'm sitting in some very dim fire pit) and the blue light appeared. It's again quite dim but it's there. I'd call the color violet. It's like very blue purple.\n\nFrom what I understand both of them are obstacles and they need to be overcome somehow. As I kept reading the new old Taisha's book, I found that practice of drawing a circle with your nose and then pushing the center. Even if the book doesn't say why you need to do this, I though that is exactly for this: to push the veil away.\n\nHere is what happened and why I report now: at about 2h30min in I remembered the technique and started to draw the circle and push/pull the center. I drww it just 3 times and pushed/pulled it quite a bit more and then I stopped as I saw a black dot in the middle and it kept growing on it's own. I didn't make any effort to make it bigger, I felt it's not just growing but like if it's approaching me. So I said, \"Please come, you are welcome\" and it engulfed me.\n\nThe black was not exactly clean, it had \"lints\" of the other colors in it. Certainty came that I see now through the veil.\n\nI can't explain the logic of why I started doing the pass I'll describe next. Probably it's again influenced by a similar pass in the Taisha's book... Or because there is and exercise like that in Quigong... \n\nI'm sitting cross legged. I put both hands in front of me like in prayer hands. Firmly pushed them together and on inhale moved them up trying to reach the emanations above us that were reachable to the ancestors. On exhale, moved the hands down and little bit lower to the edge of the ribcage. I did it 3 times before I noticed that there is a red glow that moves with my hands. It's in total darkness but for the first time I saw the light patch that didn't follow my gaze but did follow the palms. I even moved them from side to side and moved my head to verify it. The dim red patch moved with hands only. I massaged/inhaled the light in to the V spot on top of the rib cage (seemed right thing to do). There was no light on the hands anymore. I did the same pass 3 more times and the glow came back again. It's dim though, nowhere as light as Dan describes.\n\nI tried reversing the breathing, exhale while moving hands up and inhale when moving them down -- nothing. Restored the order to inhale moving the hands up, exhale moving hands down, the patch came back again.\n\nThere is a thing about the breathing though, I don't just breath, I pull on something from the above me on inhale and while exhaling I don't release that something but focus on the sliding sensation in the body that starts in the last third of the exhale. Perhaps I need to post on that separately.\n\nIn the end, after the black came and I did these passes, if I looked down I could see the orange red glow on my torso and blackness around. With the veil before there was no way to tell the boundary, the red color was on the floor everywhere.\n\nDo you want to try the same movement?\n\nP/S as I was typing this, I remembered a couple more things to share.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A Short 3 week reports", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_k3z8y0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_xmlx6", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1606754034.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi sub!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to check in with a quick report on my progress so far.

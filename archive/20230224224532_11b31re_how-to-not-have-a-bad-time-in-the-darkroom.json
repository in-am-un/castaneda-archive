Darkroom is probably still the fastest method we have in our arsenal because we now have lots of darkroom gazers in here building up energetic mass behind the practice. Unfortunately, darkroom is hard as hell, especially in the beginning.\n\nThe reality is that most folks simply do not have enough time, energy and mental bandwidth leftover in the day to do darkroom, exponentially so for those married with kids and have demanding jobs. And without somewhat of a methodological process going into the darkroom, there's a tendency to shelve this practice due to its sheer difficulty and relative lack of results early on, especially for those of the male persuasion. I know that because it happened to me! Remember, we're trying to get \"hooked\" by magic ASAP. Eventually, you will naturally make more time to do darkroom when you start to see results.\n\nSo what kinds of qualities and conditions lead to a good darkroom session, and conversely, to a shit time in the darkroom? I suspect it might be easier to exclusively focus on the qualities that make a shit time in the darkroom. Ultimately what constitutes a shit day will vary from person to person; you'll need to do some personal experimentation for yourself. That said, I feel compelled to share a few qualities I've identified as a beginner myself (with perhaps a little more darkroom experience), in an effort to steer others on the right path. This is by no means a comprehensive list (and feel free to add it), but I'd say that a shit day is the result of the following:\n\n* **Poor silence in the darkroom.** \\#1 factor going into a bad time in the darkroom. Silence in the darkroom can be improved by practicing forcing off the internal dialogue all day outside the darkroom, the results of which are cumulative. You really do gain a tiny bit of silence bit by bit if you keep it up! Full silence is best but I find eliminating \"me\" thoughts on the spot to be a bit easier to manage at first. Knock yourself out by religiously reviewing the silence category on the wiki. Read all of it regularly because silence is ridiculously hard!\n* **Not enough tensegrity.** Doing as much tensegrity as possible in darkroom really does have the function of adding visible magic in the air and of giving you more energy. It also keeps you awake too. I find it easier to identify specific forms you prefer and then doing those forms over and over again. For example, I really like the Affection Pass and can do it all night long, but can't stand doing the Mashing energy series more than once or twice a night, even though that one is highly effective aswell! Just doing a few forms once or twice each isn't gonna cut it. Keep doing the forms while forcing silence the best you can and really push your awareness of the \"feel\" and \"flow\" of the movements and of your muscles activating during the movements. Maybe a good way to think about this is that you're really trying to engage your body similar to how your awareness is focused on stretches while doing yoga or while martial arts like jiu jitsu. Again, read all the wiki stuff on this subject!\n* **Sitting for too long in the darkroom.** I'm guilty of this often because I'm lazy but sitting for long stretches of time will make you doze off repeatedly (a little dozing off is a good sign of AP movement but not for long periods of time!). Get up and do erratic movements! Flail your arms to wake yourself up, do some stretches in the dark. That might actually help unclog some energy stuck in various places on your body which you can capture as puffs! Just don't think about trying to create your own tensegrity moves. We have no naguals here and tensegrity is specifically designed with magic hidden inside the movements! Instead, focus on doing tensegrity movements as accurately as you can to bake them into your muscle memory, then add a bit of your own personal flair to the movements. The double likes novelty and fun, random things and will come out to see what you're doing!\n* **Not enough recapitulation.** We can all use more recap, but I find it helpful to tackle all the extremely difficult and emotionally charged memories first before you do your practice. We need all the energy we can get back from said memories to do darkroom.\n* **Not enough dreaming energy.** I will need to add more to this one but doing things like indulging in too many mental fantasies outside the darkroom will drain your energy.\n* **Practicing at the wrong time of the day**. Do some experimentation to figure out the ideal practice times that work for your schedule and which produce the best results. But generally, I'd say you wouldn't want to practice too close to bedtime when you're super sleepy or say right after a vigorous workout when you're physically and mentally exhausted. You'll just tend to doze off aggressively if you do that and then waste your darkroom session. Having a wasted darkroom session = less likelihood you'll want to practice later. Some do better waking up in the middle of the night to practice, others practice in the early morning before starting the day. I like to start darkroom no later than 11 PM but preferably in the late afternoon if I can.\n* **No sunlight glitter.** Collecting a minimum of 5-10 minutes of sunlight glitter everyday really does turbocharge the vividness and detail of what you witness in the darkroom. More glitter is even better! Vividness, clarity of the \"sights\" and more detail/definition really do make a big difference and will keep you coming back to the darkroom! Glitter resets everyday so you'll want to gather glitter before you start your practice, otherwise it'll just be wasted away on your normal sleeping dreams.\n* **Any iota of expectation.** Expectation kills progress in the darkroom. This one can be difficult because you would undoubtedly have some kind of latent expectation if you did all this prep work to create the perfect conditions for a badass darkroom session. It can also be difficult containing expectation the day after an amazing session but it's best to just keep doing it with a feeling of nonchalant \"non-concern\" without dwelling on past experiences. Which leads me to the next one:\n* **Not being In the \"right mood\".** Doing sorcery requires a certain mood of \"non-concern\" going into the darkroom. You don't have a specific preference on how things are going to go and what results you might encounter, you just get in there and do it! In fact many of very my best darkroom practice sessions happened when I had limited time, but didn't ruminate on that, instead just focused on getting my butt in there! Intent favors action!\n* **Not being in the middle of the blue line when starting practice.** Emotional swings and moodiness will prevent vertical movements of the assemblage point. Don't practice after a stressful work call or right after your kid throws a temper tantrum and destroys the living room. Take a breather; go on a walk (while practicing the \"right way of walking\"), enjoy a nice day while practicing sky gazing, do a hobby in silence etc. Not sure if this is as important for women though. Perhaps women can ride subtle moods and feelings as a means of shifting the assemblage point.\n* **Too much self-pity and self-importance.** Silence that incessant inner critic telling you vicious things! That condescending voice telling you things such as \"This guy thinks he's some kind of badass 'sorcerer' now! Everybody watch out for Mr. Super Scary Sorcerer over here!!\" and that contrasting voice of self-importance like \"Damn, how am I so good at this with comparatively little effort? I'm way better than all these other noobs on the subreddit. I'm special!\" Force those thoughts out! You'll come to realize how ridiculous the voices of self-pity and self-importance are the more you pay attention to your thoughts! Sometimes I'll even get internal dialogue trying to get me to feel bad for myself at the start of a thought and end that thought trail with an arrogant sounding voice!\n   * Don't feel bad for yourself if you have a perceived mental or physical \"handicap\". I have ADHD - a condition that can make my internal dialogue and inability to focus attention truly horrible at times - and others practice with schizophrenia but darkroom is still viable despite those \"handicaps\"!\n   * Acting with an air of entitlement and having a woe is me mindset kill darkroom progress! Victimhood mentality and darkroom do not mix!\n* **Wrong intent (eg: book deal mindset).** Intent to profit, steal or get attention will get you nowhere in this practice. Just look at Mantak Chia. He steals from our community with intent to sell his own weak-ass, watered down darkroom workshops for thousands of dollars apiece. Intent to get money, excessive validation from others, or use this for nefarious purposes will not lock you into the right intent. We know this because exactly 0 bad players over the last few decades were able to get any real substantive magic while practicing with the wrong intent.\n   * Instead, voice your intent in the darkroom! Tell intent what you want so it knows the direction you want to perceive (all realities).\n   * These days, I find it very helpful to listen to the audiobooks while I'm doing any kind of monotonous task (such as driving or cooking) in order to saturate myself with the right intent from the books.\n* **Too much outside inventory.** This practice relies on tuning into a very specific and extremely faint intent trail. As such, its best to drop practices from other systems and religious beliefs to be able to better tune in to that very faint intent signal. Guys like \"Mr. Love and Light\" bad player we had the other day will never succeed in moving their AP far because they're too interested trying to practice 10 other religions/spiritual systems at the same time on top of lording their \"specialness\" over others. To do this practice successfully, you must drop all outside inventory immediately! Now this mostly applies to males but it's true. I have more \"Buddhist baggage\" than anyone else on here as a result of being born into the tradition but I only saw progress in the darkroom when I decided to push all of that aside!\n   * How can you expect to get off the Island of the Tonal if you are so saddled down with inventory OF the Island of Tonal? What we're after has absolutely nothing to do with this world!\n   * For some reason, the mere suggestion of dropping outside inventory seem to cause our bad player men to foam at the mouth in rage. They are highly resistant to dropping other practices, many of which they have invested years in and, in some instances, built a reputation/followers of their own. But real magic is available if you simply put a pause to all that! Don't think about it, don't practice other stuff, don't consume relevant content on other practices. Simply shut it all off. Only then does magic present itself to you in a substantive way. And how could clinging onto other (less effective) practices be more important than witnessing real magic?!\n* **Being in a less than ideal \"spot\" in the darkroom.** Identify a seated location that \"feels\" better where you're a little more comfortable than other spots.

I have more &amp;quot;Buddhist baggage&amp;quot; than anyone else on here as a result of being born into the tradition but I only saw progress in the darkroom when I decided to push all of that aside!\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How can you expect to get off the Island of the Tonal if you are so saddled down with inventory OF the Island of Tonal? What we&amp;#39;re after has absolutely nothing to do with this world!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For some reason, the mere suggestion of dropping outside inventory seem to cause our bad player men to foam at the mouth in rage. They are highly resistant to dropping other practices, many of which they have invested years in and, in some instances, built a reputation/followers of their own. But real magic is available if you simply put a pause to all that! Don&amp;#39;t think about it, don&amp;#39;t practice other stuff, don&amp;#39;t consume relevant content on other practices. Simply shut it all off. Only then does magic present itself to you in a substantive way. And how could clinging onto other (less effective) practices be more important than witnessing real magic?!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being in a less than ideal &amp;quot;spot&amp;quot; in the darkroom.&lt;/strong&gt; Identify a seated location that &amp;quot;feels&amp;quot; better where you&amp;#39;re a little more comfortable than other spots. This is still a work in progress for me but the books have lots of examples of Carlos being in power spots and experiencing marvels!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "acff1442-e63e-11ea-b305-0e375464469b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "11b31re", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "superr", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 17, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11b31re/how_to_not_have_a_bad_time_in_the_darkroom/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/11b31re/how_to_not_have_a_bad_time_in_the_darkroom/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1677275132.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ja1vn6r", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ja0jzp1", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That looks like what I see as \"white\" hands.\n\nI believe you're viewing the body with the double's eyes.\n\nTechno thought that up as a possible explanation.\n\nBut you can also do what you saw, with objects.\n\nIn both cases, you are retraining the tonal's eyes.\n\nIt's possible that the tonal awareness, which is obsessed with our organic body, can be taught to be less restrictive in it's vision, through the use of the energy body's sight.\n\nSo for example, what if you insisted on seeing that daily, believing it would \"retrain\" your eyes?\n\nWould it?\n\nWe don't know.

To start off, try your best not to fantasize or think \"me\" thoughts. \"Me\" thoughts are thoughts like \"Why am I so bad at working out? Jeff is way stronger than me. I did 30 things today, I'm a badass! Why am I so terrible at so and so?\" Those kinds of thoughts drain your energy - the internal dialogue keeps our attention trapped on the context of the same \"consensus reality\" shared by 8 billion other humans. So to be able to perceive other worlds, we have to redirect that tendency for self-reflection and of a reinforced self-conception onto things outside of the context of everyday reality.\n\nTensegrity is the best thing to do in the darkroom because not only is it a very useful activity to focus attention on, but it really is magical! Your movements in tensegrity produce perceivable magic in the air! The state we aim for here is similar to the \"flow state\" that occurs when doing highly focused activities like high intensity sports, martial arts, intensive hobbies, etc.\n\nOne example is an activity like Brazilian Jiu-jitsu. The individual moves are drilled endlessly over years until they become \"baked\" into the extremely powerful and capable muscle memory. This is the same muscle memory that's powerful enough to catch falling objects in a split second and lift an entire car to save a baby without requiring conscious input at all. It just *does*.\n\nDoing the tensegrity movements repeatedly with great focus on each of the individual movements, the \"flow\" between the moves, the feeling of muscle contraction/activation, etc. will help train muscle memory. And we are learning to perceive using the muscle memory instead of the thinking mind. But like jiu-jitsu, it takes a TON of repetition to fully train the muscle memory so that the movements become second nature. Another example, I've been skiing for 28 years but never got good at mogul skiing on steep slopes. I finally decided I wanted to get good at it this season. Doing so required watching videos of the technique, forcing myself to practice them on the slopes with great attention paid to the execution of the movements, and most importantly, a ton of practice. Because of my focused efforts to bake the correct technique and execution in my muscle memory, I can now do slightly smaller moguls on easier black diamond runs without too much issue. And doing them doesn't require the same amount of conscious input required during and before I started really practicing getting good at the moguls. Input like \"ok, you can do it, just go down the bump, get to the top of the bump, pivot and turn, then ski to next one\". I simply *intend* going down the hill and then decide which path to go down. After practicing silence, you can even see how unnecessary the inner echo is in this instance; a decision as to which path to take down the mountain was actually already made without any echo at all! We just think we needed the echo to make decisions because that's how we've habitually operated for years.\n\nSo to do anything inside and outside the darkroom, you simply *intend* and *do*. You don't actively think about all the steps around picking up a mug to drink water do you? Your parents taught you how to pick up the mug as an infant by training you over a period of time and nowadays, you just *intend* and the action carries through automatically.

Experts said wrestling move.](https://preview.redd.it/50uo1sr3x4u81.png?width=1387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4ae94ed5d193bf2057ac2bec118b61c8296f62f)\n\nCarlos was fond of Olmec figurines, showing us pictures of one or two from time to time.\n\nThe Olmecs had the oldest government in the Americas, and were the half of the peoples who crossed over the frozen land masses above Alaska, and migrated into the Americas.\n\nHalf went west, and became the Luiseno.\n\nHalf went down the middle, and ended up on the east coast of Mexico, becoming the Olmec.\n\nFor this particular figurine, he said that was a Tensegrity move.\n\nBut others had suggested it was a wrestler instead.  And Olmec art often includes wrestlers.\n\nI found myself a little in doubt about the Tensegrity claim,  because it didn't fit my idea (at the time) of a \"Tensegrity move\".\n\nAlthough I had to allow that Carlos knew this from doing \"re-runs\" of Olmec history.  You can literally go back and watch it live.\n\nI've done it!  Silence is the key.  In perfect silence, you \"sense something\", and \"turn your head\".\n\nAnd you zip into a 100% realistic reliving of the past.  You can even \"zip\" back once, and try it again, and it works!\n\nMy inorganic being told me, don't do that sort of thing more than twice!  Didn't say what the danger was.\n\nYou don't necessarily know who you are reliving.  And you can't seem to alter the flow of events.\n\nWhich is frustrating, because you don't even look up to see who you are talking to.  You \"know\" who that is, and have no reason to scan their face, so your body snatcher companion can remember it after the \"re-run\" is over.\n\nThe person you are reliving, doesn't even know you've come along for the ride.\n\nBut you get to see in general what was going on, from one person's point of view.\n\nI tried this \"wrestling\" move myself last night, and was surprised to find it produces DRASTIC results when you are near to Silent Knowledge.  It flows energy from back to front, due to the arching of the shoulders, and then \"frames\" it due to the position of both arms.\n\nYou find yourself looking down a magical \"beam\" of sorts made of very fine pinkish \"dots\".\n\nThousands of them, leading off into the distance.  And the beam is around 3 feet square, with no end to the length projecting out from your chest.\n\nI tried it on a remote viewing target I've been using, and saw 2 figures highlighted in the pink.\n\nIt was 2 people, but no facial details.\n\nStill, the best view I'd gotten of them in a few weeks. They're around 1000 miles away.\n\nI used to do that with Cholita but she was only 30 feet away, through 2 walls in our home. And she \"blocked\" it after I stupidly told her what I had learned to do.\n\nThis shoulder position is definitely a \"thing\" you would discover by accident if you learned to move your assemblage point that far, and you'd then keep it in the back of your mind as useful in the future.\n\nIt's mildly like \"lobster strike\".\n\nBut still I had some doubts, as of 3AM this morning.\n\nBut not about the Olmecs practicing our form of  sorcery in general.  That's very clear.\n\nOlmec figurines are rather amusing because if you look at them, you realize they are indeed practicing our very form of magic.  And looking at figurines from other cultures, you can see they did not.\n\nHere's a sorcerer playing with his double, the same way I do nearly nightly using the affection pass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[You can hold up your double and \\\\\"use his eyesight\\\\\" to aid you.](https://preview.redd.it/8k9y5scvx4u81.png?width=350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=921defc12070caef75f7703adf07df2b76a00b4c)\n\nAnd yet, the top level of \"bad players\" in the Castaneda community, like Kachora, \"Colorado Carlos\",  or the \"impeccable is all you need\" devil's weed or mushroom sorcerers, are totally fixated on the first 4 books and the idea that this is Yaqui.\n\nGot Carlos criticized over that.  And in fact, he went looking for an \"informant\" for his PhD thesis on how to use power plants.  That's how he ran into don Juan, a Yaqui Indian.\n\nStudying native Americans was all the rage at the time!  My father was involved in the same sort of thing, which put me into contact with 2 sorcerers at Morongo.\n\nSo I fully understand what Carlos wanted, and why he wanted it.\n\nI suppose it was a tiny bit like your university saying you could get a PhD on \"exotic dancers\".\n\nElsewhere that PhD might be considered dubious.\n\nSo if it's allowed, why not???\n\nIn a similar way, studying the use of drugs was \"socially marginal\".\n\nEven in that period when Einstein was popping gel tabs made by Owsley Stanley.\n\nIt still wasn't \"mainstream\".\n\nBut the UC System realized all of the native American knowledge would soon be lost if someone didn't try it preserve it.  So it was ok to go research that sort of topic.\n\nDon Juan was approached by Carlos, after he was perhaps \"turned away\" at Morongo.  UCR was studying them.\n\nNow as you all ought to know, don Juan was NOT a \"Yaqui shaman\".\n\nHe was  a Yaqui, long moved to Mexico, who happened to have a very old form of sorcery, which was taught in lineages.\n\nAnd his lineage had contained all kinds of strange people.  A Chinese pirate, a catholic church Bishop, some Mazatec Indians,  and at least 2 Yaqui in the current generation.\n\nBut it was not in any way a \"Yaqui way of knowledge\".\n\nFrankly, and no offense meant to Native Americans, any shamanism I've heard about is totally impotent these days.  They seem to have lost the \"old seer\" knowledge, but retained the rituals and power plants used by the \"Men of Knowledge\".\n\nThe \"profitable\" kind of Olmec magical practices.\n\nAs proof, even Maria Sabina wasn't all that hot.\n\nIf you could \"study with her\", you'd be making a huge mistake, seeing as how the real thing is also available.\n\nShe had to use drugs to meet with her spirits, probably did it with eyes closed, and when she \"felt bad\", she claims they were lost to her.  I'm not sure they ever came back.\n\nThat means, she never moved her assemblage point beyond the bottom of the back.  And she only got it there with drugs.\n\nMeaning, she didn't even know about the assemblage point, or that you could go further, or that you could do it with internal silence instead of drugs.\n\nThat's the current state of Shamanism as far as I know. It's lost the amazing levels of magic the Olmecs had.\n\nExcept for a \"handful of lineages\", still hiding out.\n\nHiding.\n\nDon't be gullible.  If some man claims to be part of \"a different lineage\", he's a fraud.  Hide your charge card.\n\nBut Don  Juan simply had no choice but to tell Carlos it was \"Yaqui Knowledge\", because he'd been waiting a long time for a double male to create a new lineage.  And the truth would have caused Carlos to go elsewhere.\n\nHe couldn't do his PhD thesis based on the crazy history of lineages!\n\nSo he taught him on that basis. That it was just common \"run of the mill\" Native American shamanism.\n\nFortunately for us, that trapped the worst of the bad men out there in an obsession with \"Cultural Appropriation, and \"The Yaqui don't smoke mushrooms!\"\n\nNonsense basically.  And the ones who didn't care took drugs, and pretended to be \"impeccable warriors\".\n\nBoth kinds of bad guys out of our hair!\n\nBut don Juan also taught him using the Toltecs as an example, and so the next level of bad guys in our fan base became obsessed with \"TOLTEC!!!!\"\n\nIf someone wants to steal and has a book, there's a very good chance that word is on the cover.\n\nThey again jumped to the wrong conclusion.  The Toltecs were merely the last time sorcery was out in the open, practiced by an entire civilization.\n\nBut the Toltec were wiped out.  Not by the Spanish.  By other Indians.\n\nAnd the lineages were formed.\n\nTHAT'S our sorcery.  The Lineages.\n\nAnd if you go back to the source, it's 7,000-10,000 year old Olmec proto-Siberian Beringian magic.\n\n7000 because the old seer is 7000 years old.  10,000, because the Luiseno on the west coast are that old, and our sorcery ancestors came down with them, but went a different path at the top of the USA.\n\nFortunately,  the other \"worst among us\" are all obsessed with \"Toltec!!!!!\"  So they also got distracted off.\n\nThat means anyone studying in this subreddit can easily spot the bad guys.\n\nIf they don't know it's Olmec,  there's no chance in hell they have any actual knowledge.\n\nBut what about this wrestler statue?  Could it really be a sorcerer, as Carlos claimed?\n\nYep.  Check the last word in the page.  And keep in mind, \"shaman\" also doesn't really apply to us.  Shaman is more like the \"Men of Knowledge\".  Those were shaman.    Ours is \"sorcery\", and technically, the \"Mastery of Intent\" form of sorcery.  Unique to the Olmec!\n\nYou can find the rest over here:  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23760521](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23760521)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/asri1t8hv4u81.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffc01bc718c142ec40b9c8f54536e88b9629be6f\n\nWhile researching this, I found these!

href=\"https://preview.redd.it/50uo1sr3x4u81.png?width=1387&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b4ae94ed5d193bf2057ac2bec118b61c8296f62f\"&gt;Carlos said tensegrity.  Experts said wrestling move.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was fond of Olmec figurines, showing us pictures of one or two from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Olmecs had the oldest government in the Americas, and were the half of the peoples who crossed over the frozen land masses above Alaska, and migrated into the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Half went west, and became the Luiseno.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Half went down the middle, and ended up on the east coast of Mexico, becoming the Olmec.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For this particular figurine, he said that was a Tensegrity move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But others had suggested it was a wrestler instead.  And Olmec art often includes wrestlers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found myself a little in doubt about the Tensegrity claim,  because it didn&amp;#39;t fit my idea (at the time) of a &amp;quot;Tensegrity move&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I had to allow that Carlos knew this from doing &amp;quot;re-runs&amp;quot; of Olmec history.  You can literally go back and watch it live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done it!  Silence is the key.  In perfect silence, you &amp;quot;sense something&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;turn your head&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you zip into a 100% realistic reliving of the past.  You can even &amp;quot;zip&amp;quot; back once, and try it again, and it works!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My inorganic being told me, don&amp;#39;t do that sort of thing more than twice!  Didn&amp;#39;t say what the danger was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t necessarily know who you are reliving.  And you can&amp;#39;t seem to alter the flow of events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is frustrating, because you don&amp;#39;t even look up to see who you are talking to.  You &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; who that is, and have no reason to scan their face, so your body snatcher companion can remember it after the &amp;quot;re-run&amp;quot; is over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The person you are reliving, doesn&amp;#39;t even know you&amp;#39;ve come along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you get to see in general what was going on, from one person&amp;#39;s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried this &amp;quot;wrestling&amp;quot; move myself last night, and was surprised to find it produces DRASTIC results when you are near to Silent Knowledge.  It flows energy from back to front, due to the arching of the shoulders, and then &amp;quot;frames&amp;quot; it due to the position of both arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You find yourself looking down a magical &amp;quot;beam&amp;quot; of sorts made of very fine pinkish &amp;quot;dots&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thousands of them, leading off into the distance.  And the beam is around 3 feet square, with no end to the length projecting out from your chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried it on a remote viewing target I&amp;#39;ve been using, and saw 2 figures highlighted in the pink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was 2 people, but no facial details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, the best view I&amp;#39;d gotten of them in a few weeks. They&amp;#39;re around 1000 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to do that with Cholita but she was only 30 feet away, through 2 walls in our home. And she &amp;quot;blocked&amp;quot; it after I stupidly told her what I had learned to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This shoulder position is definitely a &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; you would discover by accident if you learned to move your assemblage point that far, and you&amp;#39;d then keep it in the back of your mind as useful in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s mildly like &amp;quot;lobster strike&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still I had some doubts, as of 3AM this morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not about the Olmecs practicing our form of  sorcery in general.  That&amp;#39;s very clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Olmec figurines are rather amusing because if you look at them, you realize they are indeed practicing our very form of magic.  And looking at figurines from other cultures, you can see they did not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a sorcerer playing with his double, the same way I do nearly nightly using the affection pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8k9y5scvx4u81.png?width=350&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=921defc12070caef75f7703adf07df2b76a00b4c\"&gt;You can hold up your double and \\&amp;quot;use his eyesight\\&amp;quot; to aid you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, the top level of &amp;quot;bad players&amp;quot; in the Castaneda community, like Kachora, &amp;quot;Colorado Carlos&amp;quot;,  or the &amp;quot;impeccable is all you need&amp;quot; devil&amp;#39;s weed or mushroom sorcerers, are totally fixated on the first 4 books and the idea that this is Yaqui.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got Carlos criticized over that.  And in fact, he went looking for an &amp;quot;informant&amp;quot; for his PhD thesis on how to use power plants.  That&amp;#39;s how he ran into don Juan, a Yaqui Indian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Studying native Americans was all the rage at the time!  My father was involved in the same sort of thing, which put me into contact with 2 sorcerers at Morongo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I fully understand what Carlos wanted, and why he wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it was a tiny bit like your university saying you could get a PhD on &amp;quot;exotic dancers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere that PhD might be considered dubious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if it&amp;#39;s allowed, why not???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, studying the use of drugs was &amp;quot;socially marginal&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even in that period when Einstein was popping gel tabs made by Owsley Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It still wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;mainstream&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the UC System realized all of the native American knowledge would soon be lost if someone didn&amp;#39;t try it preserve it.  So it was ok to go research that sort of topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan was approached by Carlos, after he was perhaps &amp;quot;turned away&amp;quot; at Morongo.  UCR was studying them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now as you all ought to know, don Juan was NOT a &amp;quot;Yaqui shaman&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was  a Yaqui, long moved to Mexico, who happened to have a very old form of sorcery, which was taught in lineages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And his lineage had contained all kinds of strange people.  A Chinese pirate, a catholic church Bishop, some Mazatec Indians,  and at least 2 Yaqui in the current generation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was not in any way a &amp;quot;Yaqui way of knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, and no offense meant to Native Americans, any shamanism I&amp;#39;ve heard about is totally impotent these days.  They seem to have lost the &amp;quot;old seer&amp;quot; knowledge, but retained the rituals and power plants used by the &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;profitable&amp;quot; kind of Olmec magical practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As proof, even Maria Sabina wasn&amp;#39;t all that hot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you could &amp;quot;study with her&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;d be making a huge mistake, seeing as how the real thing is also available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had to use drugs to meet with her spirits, probably did it with eyes closed, and when she &amp;quot;felt bad&amp;quot;, she claims they were lost to her.  I&amp;#39;m not sure they ever came back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means, she never moved her assemblage point beyond the bottom of the back.  And she only got it there with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, she didn&amp;#39;t even know about the assemblage point, or that you could go further, or that you could do it with internal silence instead of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the current state of Shamanism as far as I know. It&amp;#39;s lost the amazing levels of magic the Olmecs had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except for a &amp;quot;handful of lineages&amp;quot;, still hiding out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hiding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be gullible.  If some man claims to be part of &amp;quot;a different lineage&amp;quot;, he&amp;#39;s a fraud.  Hide your charge card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Don  Juan simply had no choice but to tell Carlos it was &amp;quot;Yaqui Knowledge&amp;quot;, because he&amp;#39;d been waiting a long time for a double male to create a new lineage.  And the truth would have caused Carlos to go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He couldn&amp;#39;t do his PhD thesis based on the crazy history of lineages!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he taught him on that basis. That it was just common &amp;quot;run of the mill&amp;quot; Native American shamanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for us, that trapped the worst of the bad men out there in an obsession with &amp;quot;Cultural Appropriation, and &amp;quot;The Yaqui don&amp;#39;t smoke mushrooms!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nonsense basically.  And the ones who didn&amp;#39;t care took drugs, and pretended to be &amp;quot;impeccable warriors&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both kinds of bad guys out of our hair!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don Juan also taught him using the Toltecs as an example, and so the next level of bad guys in our fan base became obsessed with &amp;quot;TOLTEC!!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone wants to steal and has a book, there&amp;#39;s a very good chance that word is on the cover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They again jumped to the wrong conclusion.  The Toltecs were merely the last time sorcery was out in the open, practiced by an entire civilization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the Toltec were wiped out.  Not by the Spanish.  By other Indians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the lineages were formed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT&amp;#39;S our sorcery.  The Lineages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you go back to the source, it&amp;#39;s 7,000-10,000 year old Olmec proto-Siberian Beringian magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7000 because the old seer is 7000 years old.  10,000, because the Luiseno on the west coast are that old, and our sorcery ancestors came down with them, but went a different path at the top of the USA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately,  the other &amp;quot;worst among us&amp;quot; are all obsessed with &amp;quot;Toltec!!!!!&amp;quot;  So they also got distracted off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means anyone studying in this subreddit can easily spot the bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s Olmec,  there&amp;#39;s no chance in hell they have any actual knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what about this wrestler statue?  Could it really be a sorcerer, as Carlos claimed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep.  Check the last word in the page.  And keep in mind, &amp;quot;shaman&amp;quot; also doesn&amp;#39;t really apply to us.  Shaman is more like the &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot;.  Those were shaman.    Ours is &amp;quot;sorcery&amp;quot;, and technically, the &amp;quot;Mastery of Intent&amp;quot; form of sorcery.  Unique to the Olmec!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find the rest over here:  &lt;a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23760521\"&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/23760521&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/asri1t8hv4u81.png?width=686&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ffc01bc718c142ec40b9c8f54536e88b9629be6f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/asri1t8hv4u81.png?width=686&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ffc01bc718c142ec40b9c8f54536e88b9629be6f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While researching this, I found these!

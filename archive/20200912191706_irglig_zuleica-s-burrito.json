They covered them from neck to toes. She ordered them next to sit back to back on a mat in the same alcove where I myself used to sit. She told them that their task was to gaze at the darkness until it began to acquire a hue\"  \n\n\nbeing wrapped in a cotton cover seems helpful for zuleica's technique at least thats the main difference i could pinpoint by doing an analysis of my successful practices, every time i had deep assemblage point movements was when tightly wrapped in my covers  \n\n\nhere's the experience from my practice time today ( im not sure in which order the first 2 lucid dreams happened, if you are interested only about the dark room practice skip to the last part )  \n\n\n\\-i was in my practice room, and both my parents were there but looked kind of strange and shady ,so i told them to go out, then i noticed i was way bigger then them and i remembered that in carlos books dj points our that the dreaming double is bigger then the normal body, so i followed my parents but they escaped and closed themself in a room, i opened the room and i saw them waiting for me staring, it felt kind of scary, so i understood they were iob and not my parents, after realizing this i don't remember exactly what happen cause i blanked out\n\n\\-i realized i was watching one of the most beautiful night skies  i have ever seen there were stars, galaxies, comets and it had all kinds of colors from purple to deep blue and black, i was in a giant space station with glass roof floating in the middle of this beautiful cosmos, i looked around myself and i realized i was inside a kayak inside a flowing river/ water ride then my kayak started being pulled by the water current, i was going very fast it was like a water park ride , it felt like i was falling , and the more i fell the more silent  i got (like last experience i posted, i guess for me getting silent feels like im falling), the water ride lasted very long i can't fully remember all the stuff i saw i just remember i was going in a water ride in space then i entered a deep block of fog then i found myself in a subterranean water river, but more then what i was seeing itself the most interesting part for me is the intensity of the sensation of falling/ getting silent after falling like this for a while, the images of the dream disappeared and only the sensation of falling remained\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthen i found myself in my practice chair  i watched around my room , it was kind of lighted up , i could recognize my bookshelf on my left, but then i watched around and saw bookshelves on all sides of the room (which is not the case in my normal room) so i tried to get up from my chair but couldn't, my body was too heavy but the difference from last time is that i managed to move both my arms and legs, puffs of colors were flying around the room, so i started scooping them and smearing them on my body, then a bar of light with darkness flowing out of it came flying towards me, so i scooped it up too, at the bottom of the right side of the room there was a strong orange light and near it there was a teddy bear with black eyes, im not sure why but either the light or the teddy bear were very scary so i gazed away from them , then i started noticing that if i didn't keep moving my arms and legs to scoop colors i was loosing lucidity and a blackness started expanding from the middle of the room, if i scooped colors it receded , i managed to do it for a while then i was too tired and the blackness enveloped me and the practice ended (this last segment didn't feel like the 2 dreams i posted above, but it felt totally different )  \n\n\n[the bar of light was around 20 inches in

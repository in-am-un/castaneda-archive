[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "When Carlos first wrote his books, there was a flurry of interest.  When he started workshops, it got even hotter.\n\nUnfortunately, it's so much work that people, especially after hearing Carlos was \"a fake\", moved on to something else.\n\nWelcome back!\n\nWhile you were out, you might have taken up some other hobbies, like Buddhism, Daoism, Hinduism, Wicca, Magick, or even Martial Arts.\n\nUnfortunately, those teach you the way they teach, so you might have picked up some habits and misunderstandings you could do without if your true interest is Carlos' sorcery.\n\n1. You don't need to \"visualize\" sorcery phenomena.  They'll be real, not imagined.  Don't visualize colors in the darkness. Look for colors in the darkness.   Don't imagine inorganic beings. One will scare the hell out of you. Then you'll know there's one around.\n2. Meditative states are not silence.  At best, they're like a drug that pushes you to a specific experience.  It might be cool, but it's moved your assemblage point there, not taught you to move it anywhere you need. For example, I have a sister in law who sees hypnogogic heads after smoking medical marijuana. She's asked me to show her what she can do with it.  Nothing.  That's the problem.  It is what it is.  Consuming power plants is not the same as learning to move the assemblage point.\n3. It's not a job opportunity despite how other systems work.  You don't \"put in your time\", and end up the \"Bishop\" of a small branch.  But if you make it work, you won't care what job or title you have!   Those concerns come from being poverty striken, the normal condition of most  humans.  Once you aren't poverty striken (I'm not talking about money here), your priorities will change.\n4. Evangelizing is not a good idea.  No one will be interested, and they'll make up stuff to ruin your reputation so they can feel better about going back to sleep.  If you've ever tried to wake up a stubborn person who spends all day in bed, you know what happens. They'll curse you from amidst their slumber.\n5. There's no funny outfit to wear in sorcery.  No hair style, no jewelry, no medicine bags.  Those are your choice, but when you run into a sorcerer with \"style\", you're probably not looking at an actual sorcerer.  My favorite bad sign is a feather in the hat.   However, I have seen some young women giving a retro salute to hippies with medicine wheel earrings.  Those are ok by me.\n6. Sorcery is not inclusive.  Everything and everyone aren\u2019t ok.  That's only true in systems which need donations to survive.  Carlos regularly tossed people out on their butt, for something even as small as a single phrase.\n7. There are no procedures in Sorcery.  Only motivational compositions.   Those are things someone who can already get there put together, to keep people interested until they actually decided to commit.  The possibilities are endless, so if you find yourself in a position to teach, find out what interests the person you wish to help.\n8. The truth is not as important as the knowledge.  The knowledge is not connected to any particular view point.\n9. You aren\u2019t special.   Other systems give that feeling, because you have money in your pocket.  The truth is, you\u2019re a burden on whoever has to teach you.  All they can hope for is, you don\u2019t flake out.\n10. It's not permanent.  It never will be.  If you stop working, you lose it.  Fortunately, some of it is lost slowly.  But some is lost in a couple of days.  And some can be lost in an instant, if your assemblage point moves to the same self-pity saturated place it started.\n11. There aren\u2019t any sutras or spells.  The spirits out there are so different from us, they can\u2019t understand the context.  The closest thing to a creator in Carlos\u2019 system cares just as much about insects as it does us and doesn\u2019t have promises saved up for humans alone.\n12. There aren\u2019t any Holy men.  No one to bow to, no one to respect when they don\u2019t seem to deserve it.  No Master to defend.  No parasite living off the followers.\n13. There isn\u2019t any hazing.  It\u2019s not an Asian system where you have to earn status. Status is worse than useless to sorcerers.\n14. There aren\u2019t any secret tapes.  No SHA256 encoded secret video of sutras handed down from the buddha himself.  No ancient scrolls (copies available for a small fee).  Such things are marketing ploys to raise funds.  If someone wrote something down,  it was probably in the hope of selling a few copies.\n15. Whoever is teaching you cannot send you to hell if he\u2019s displeased.  Believe it or not, some Tibetan monks make that threat (especially to young women).  A sorcerer avoids condemning people, because he knows it creates attachments likely to condemn him.\n16. There are no politics required.  If your system has a political party in mind, I suggest it\u2019s a political organization.  Politics = noisy internal dialogue.\n17. There are no wise men.  Men who are knowledgeable about the perceptions of humans that are typically ignored are not wiser anymore than someone who can run really fast is wiser than those who can only walk.\n18. There aren't any things to ignore when practicing.  No places you should not look, no sensations you should try to avoid, no spirits you need to fear, and oddly, no fixed path you need to remain on.\n19. There isn't any object you can hang over your bed to ward off evil spirits or to bring blessings. No catholic candles to burn, unless you need something to gaze at.\n20. You cannot appease your internal dialogue. You can\u2019t become a \u201cgoddess\u201d and absorb sorcery because of your awesomeness.  You can\u2019t develop a fearsome reputation among men and make progress based on that.  You can\u2019t belong to a group of like-minded people and move forward with them.  Any progress comes from eliminating the internal dialogue by your own efforts, and anything that keeps you focused on it, for pleasure, status, or otherwise, is a hindrance.  Well, there are some exceptions to this particular rule, so it should only be considered a headsup.\n21. There are no ascended masters. Wait... Maybe there are.  Dreaming can get really weird once you can stop the internal dialogue, and retain consciousness while asleep.  But if you talk about ascended masters too often, you might have a noisy internal dialogue.\n22. There are no new book additions to Carlos' lineage. No lost naguals (Tony aside).  Well, this one is just my opinion, but it's a fairly good bet that anyone claiming to have learned from Carlos, who isn't mentioned in workshop notes, is likely just trying to earn money.  Remember, a real nagual can move someone's assemblage point, and if they want to pass on what they know, they just pick someone appropriate and deludge them.  If they're trolling for ratings, you should avoid becoming a meal ticket for them.\n23. \"A good night's sleep\" is not the most important thing for your health.  There's no magic pillow.  Only ones you can put under your butt, to prop you up as you practice silence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: four times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What You Don't Need For Learning Sorcery", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_bp5y5d", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 36, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1558028089.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1557966889.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Carlos first wrote his books, there was a flurry of interest.

Travel was very difficult back then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Chinese found his &amp;quot;teachings&amp;quot; hundreds of years later, which were actually only written down hundreds of years after the historical Buddha died of food poisoning most likely).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So who knows what got written down, compared to what he was actually teaching.  In order to steal money for himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Chinese hyped him up to godlike status.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as they did with Tai Chi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which wouldn&amp;#39;t last 10 seconds against an actual fighter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the rub of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asian martial arts have the potential to bring out the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, &amp;quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&amp;quot; would NOT be an exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible to do what you see in that film, if you can shrink the tonal and bring out the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just that no Chinese can do that.  Especially not any &amp;quot;Masters&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they can&amp;#39;t be taught.  Aren&amp;#39;t interested in anything that implies they aren&amp;#39;t already &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot;.  I tried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A Chinese mindset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; tai chi someday?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No Chinese man is going to do that. As Carlos said, &amp;quot;Chinese men are really screwed up!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I can attest to, having an office in a Chinese country that I have to visit from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fixing Tai Chi is just a hobby, if you want it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tai Chi won&amp;#39;t help you at all.

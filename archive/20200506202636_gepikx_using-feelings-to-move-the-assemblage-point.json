Something spectacular, at least the first time or two.\n\nSo how do you know what you can do? Is it only what Carlos showed us?\n\nIf that were true, it would only be because he already put his *intent* into it, so it\u2019s easier for us to do that too.\n\nBut there are so many traces of intent floating around, and in silence it\u2019s so easy to pick up on them, that you can\u2019t make any sort of rule on how you might be able to use intent, on a given day.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re struggling to compress colors into a large enough chi ball to toss, and you notice that if you look to the left you see a mountain top.\n\nIn fact, when you turn your head left you\u2019re standing on it.

They are a self-contained entity.\n\nInorganic beings have consciousness, but no organic body. And yet, they are still an entity.\n\nIntent has consciousness.

In dreaming, it might leave a pile of clothes, but the main body will be gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s not a phantom, you see lights in its place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even in dreaming.  But in dreaming and seeing, it can get a little muddier than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In waking dreaming, it either goes away and doesn&amp;#39;t come back, or it mutates into lights floating around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typically above you, although I&amp;#39;ve seen Minx hover near the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the Tensegrity moves are clearly designed to cause you to look around for such effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes stretching (Pandiculating) helps redeploy enough energy to see that collection of little lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The normal prejudice would be to believe than when you stretch, especially if it&amp;#39;s dark, your eyes get some blood rush, and you can see weird lights for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re all used to them, so that we think it&amp;#39;s just useless stuff involving the way the body works, like farting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Howard took advantage of it to some extent, since his &amp;quot;light of life&amp;quot; technique is essentially a pandiculation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you lean back, curving the spine, and look upwards in darkness, you&amp;#39;re liable to see 4 of 5 colorful pieces of light, tightly floating together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A milder version of &amp;quot;seeing stars&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, you can scoop those lights down, and hold them in your hand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of hard to explain why eye junk can be manipulated that way.  One second you&amp;#39;re telling yourself it&amp;#39;s nothing, just caused by stretching too far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next, you&amp;#39;re holding it in your hand, gazing into it like it were a window to another world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gepikx", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gepikx/using_feelings_to_move_the_assemblage_point/fpt12id/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1588883023.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1588883023.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fpssgk9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "calixto_mooneeeee", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fpsnbyw", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5kwod04j", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;But I tested Carlos' technique for telling a phantom from the real thing, and it was in fact a real being there.\n\nWhat is about this technique?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fpssgk9", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But I tested Carlos&amp;#39; technique for telling a phantom from the real thing, and it was in fact a real being there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is about this technique?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gepikx", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gepikx/using_feelings_to_move_the_assemblage_point/fpssgk9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1588878852.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1588878852.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fpsnbyw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fpr7ubr", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Panic on the way to becoming silent is normal.\n\nIt can get very **personal** too.\n\nMeaning, if I were to explain what bothers someone else, it would seem silly to you.\n\nAnd when you find what's bothering you, you might not want to tell anyone.

One viewing and some emanations mix, so the connection is there.  Same as the IOBs just want to be noticed. One time will do the  job!  But usually they can&amp;#39;t even get the first recognition from normal people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can neglect your IOB, and it fades away.  I suspect the glow of awareness of shared emanations finally cools off entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, seems unproductive to theorize about this too much because people are always looking for a way to get out of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll start waiting for in person meetings, so they can get zapped by someone else who actually did the hard work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;the sorceress \u201conly\u201d needs to believe in herself and her natural abilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita says Florinda taught her, &amp;quot;You just KNOW you are a witch, and then you are. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which agrees with those inspirational quotes about the inverted funnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s harder to do  than it sounds, because the river of shit always tries to pull you back in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just WANTING to believe, is not going to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is probably why Cholita says you have to &amp;quot;KNOW&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Know is a step above wanting to believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m out in the deep end of the orange zone, witnessing miracles all night long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even post most anymore!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But each night I start out in the blue region, with doubt and self pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those go away in 2 minutes. But if I skipped a day, it would take 10 minutes. If I skipped months, I&amp;#39;d be back to square zero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And oddly, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much magic you&amp;#39;ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The blue zone is designed to deny such things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully witches are better at &amp;quot;slipping through the cracks&amp;quot; than male sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe they don&amp;#39;t get pulled back into the mud as easily?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/spbkly/a_horrible_discovery/hwocb7a/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1644690801.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_spbkly", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hwmisn0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Choice-Shoe-1475", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1644657608.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hwk8w28", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_8o4sl1t7", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Carlos saw Don Genaro because Don Genaro double wanted to.

The &amp;quot;audience&amp;quot; was actually the IOB world, and Cholita was on the other side of that, enjoying the phantom house again, with Minx.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be curious to see if it&amp;#39;s ever the same again after being &amp;quot;crushed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita gave me entry to her &amp;quot;flat zone&amp;quot; once more that I didn&amp;#39;t report, before that event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings up a possibility. Pandora&amp;#39;s phantom  house can be &amp;quot;repaired&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;blowing it up like a tire&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just get the IOBs to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is all far out on the &amp;quot;deep end&amp;quot;, so I really need some of  you to work harder.  Just to give me confidence it&amp;#39;s all not too crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually I just go to the books or workshop notes for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I doubt we&amp;#39;d find anything on &amp;quot;how to fix a sorcery flat tire&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless, there&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;tip&amp;quot; in that story from the books. One Juann could make use of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m remembering the story correctly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To go somewhere in the double, materialize the IOB around you in the darkroom first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One night I materialized one IOBs world, and then Fancy&amp;#39;s tried to insert itself.  There was a little &amp;quot;battle&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought it was them, but maybe it was me.  The first world gave me dark energy, and I ended up where I most wanted to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was trying to find an exit in Fancy&amp;#39;s frozen ice cave. It wanted to see where it was located.

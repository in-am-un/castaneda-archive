You have to zip over to it. If you can't find a suitable mountain, zip to the highest point you can find on a nearby building, and look for mountains from there.\n\nThe point is of course, that the techniques don't matter much.  And so focusing your attention on them too much is like a placebo. It keeps your mind occupied, and reduces the likelihood you'll actually get some solid *dreaming*.\n\nThe main thing is to take dreaming as real, and explore it.  The hard part is achieving lucidity.\n\nThis is fun.  Maybe we should talk more about dreaming, and less about Zuleica?\n\nI have a thought in this regard.\n\nDreaming is a good substitute for power plants, in people who aren't so rigid that they're stuck in the Tonal.\n\nBut for people who get nothing at all during meditation, can't ever find their hands, and don't recall any weird stuff they did as children, power plants are appropriate.\n\nAnd shrooms are very easy to grow.

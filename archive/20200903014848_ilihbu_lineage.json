But not a single experience ever truly convinced me they are real.\n\nMost likely I never dreamed of \"inorganic beings\" in all of my hundreds of dreaming experiences simply because... I didn't really believe in them. The corollary would be:  I think people who dream of inorganic beings do so simply because... they do believe in them.\n\nAnd most people who believe in them read about it in the Art Of Dreaming \\*\\*before\\*\\* experiencing them in dreaming.\n\nBasic finding:  in dreaming, you can meet God if you believe in God, go to heaven if you believe in heaven, meet the spirit if you believe in it, travel through outer space if you believe you can, etc. You can do whatever you believe you can, or really want (maybe anything that captures your imagination). That principle stacks up against all of my own experiences, and I think there is no credible evidence to the contrary.\n\nFor anyone to convince me otherwise they would need to do things in the real physical world related to dreaming, or prove shared dreaming is possible.  No one did that - not Carlos, not his witches, not his apprentices, not my friends, no one.\n\nFor all the talk of shared dreaming, and all my dreaming with \"sorcerers\" and \"witches\", including Carlos, there was not one experience that completely convinced me shared dreaming is real.\n\nSo back to \"the line\".  To get me to cross, someone would have to prove dreaming CAN affect the physical universe we all share, OR prove dream worlds CAN be shared.\n\nDan and others here have convinced themselves dreaming phenomena are real. I've already read a lot of the accounts here, and still don't understand how they are so convinced.\n\nI know very well how many amazing things can \\*seem\\* real in dreaming. I also know very well how exciting aware dreaming can be, especially when you first learn and start getting good at it.  At first, it seemed incredible to me too.  I thought I was a real Luke Skywalker.\n\nAnd dreaming awake or lucid dreaming asleep makes little difference to me - similar brain functions are involved either way.\n\nPeople here appear to believe waking dreaming significantly differs from lucid dreaming. I was only able to enter dreaming from waking a few times over the years. I can count the times on one hand, but those few experiences did not \\*feel\\* that different to me. Perhaps because I did a lot of lucid dreaming using a \"disciplined\" method.  To me, entering dreaming from waking felt similar to many of the more realistic-seeming dreaming experiences I had involving \"waking up\" in exact copies of my room, and I had many of those experiences too.\n\nBecause I used \"waking up into new dreaming scenes\" as a main method of changing dreaming scenes, I had lots of experiences with false awakenings and sleep paralysis. I frequently experienced multiple false awakenings (it's natural to believe you're awake when you JUST woke up. That's especially true when you \"wake up\" in the room you went to sleep in).  Indeed, those were always the most realistic dreaming experiences.  So the intense realism of waking dreaming was nothing new to me.\n\nI experienced sleep paralysis many times too. After the first 3 or 4 times (slightly disturbing), I realized all you really need to do when this happens is to relax and \\*intend\\* either to wake up or to slide back into dreaming again.\n\nI didn't see you guys mention how in sleep paralysis you can open your eyes and see the real room.  You may also see hypnagogia super-imposed on the room and this often freaks people out (believing it's real). That hardly ever bothered me, but a few times I \"woke up\" to a face staring at me and jerked awake believing an intruder was there. Once it was a phantom and once it was my 6-year-old whom I punched before realizing it.\n\nThe secret to sleep paralysis is just don't panic and don't jump to ridiculous conclusions. Relax completely and intend either to wake up or to go back into dreaming.\n\nNow about \"reading infinity\".... The quote below is from the book \"No Man Knows My History - The Life of Joseph Smith\" by Fawn M. Brodie:\n\n\"Joseph Smith...would put the seer stone into a hat, and put his face in the hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the darkness the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing.  One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English... Thus the book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.\"\n\nSo there's a historical precursor to \"reading infinity\".  You want to convert to Mormonism now?  :)  This might even be where Carlos got the idea?\n\nCarlos: \"...the dot of pomegranate expands and finally explodes into thoughts or visions, or in the case of a literate man, into written words; sorcerers either see visions engendered by energy, hear thoughts being voiced as words, or read written words.\" (Active Side)\n\nI would just ask you to notice how Joseph and Carlos read \\*\\*completely different things\\*\\* using such methods.\n\nThe simplest explanation: what they \"read\" merely corresponded to their own beliefs.  (Notice, it's not what they \"know\" either; it's what they believe. Big difference.)\n\n\"Reading infinity\" is a thing I thought I was about to succeed in as a believer in the 90s. I could see \"lavender clouds\" and the \"pomegranate dot\" Carlos talked about and could even read words scrolling out of the images - although it was nearly impossible to make sense of them.\n\nIt is still easy for me to see such things. If I get up to pee at night, I can see \"purple clouds\" with my eyes closed or open. If I get up and walk around the room I can still see them;  it doesn't even have to be very dark and I don't even have to be silent.\n\nJust last week I did that, and even got to where I could start to see \"faces\" in the \"purple clouds\".  I think that's probably a fairly common visual phenomenon, and I don't think it's that hard to see such things.  I certainly don't think it turns into \"inorganic beings\".\n\nThat same night, I went back to sleep and did some lucid dreaming (that's still how I do dreaming) where I was with some people in a dark corner of an office all looking at hypnagogic images on a wall together.  :)\n\nLearning to see the same forms over and over in dreaming imagery, as Dan apparently has (to some degree), is probably what convinces him there's reality in what he perceives.  I'll admit that's impressive, for the tendency is for the imagery to morph around.\n\nI can see \"bright white dots\" if I focus on looking for them. I regularly see blotches of color and strange swirls and waves. I can see things looking at the sky, the ceiling, the walls, or darkness. I see detailed \"hypnagogia\" going to sleep or waking up. Gazing in darkness, it makes little difference whether my eyes are open or closed, suggesting that such \"sights\" relate to how the brain interprets visual information.\n\nI'm sure people can \\*\\*make\\*\\* what they see or read in hypnagogia seem to make sense (just as Joseph Smith did), and I know you can enter waking dreaming via those hypnagogia. I've entered dreaming that way a few times, but find it difficult and to succeed conditions need to be just right (that's not how I learned it).  To be clear, I first learned dreaming by doing three main things:\n\n1. Practicing \"the right way of walking\" for hundreds of hours.  (My map said to.)\n2. Intending to become aware while inside dreams.  (And I got good at it.)\n3.

But not a single experience ever truly convinced me they are real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most likely I never dreamed of &amp;quot;inorganic beings&amp;quot; in all of my hundreds of dreaming experiences simply because... I didn&amp;#39;t really believe in them. The corollary would be:  I think people who dream of inorganic beings do so simply because... they do believe in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And most people who believe in them read about it in the Art Of Dreaming **before** experiencing them in dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basic finding:  in dreaming, you can meet God if you believe in God, go to heaven if you believe in heaven, meet the spirit if you believe in it, travel through outer space if you believe you can, etc. You can do whatever you believe you can, or really want (maybe anything that captures your imagination). That principle stacks up against all of my own experiences, and I think there is no credible evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For anyone to convince me otherwise they would need to do things in the real physical world related to dreaming, or prove shared dreaming is possible.  No one did that - not Carlos, not his witches, not his apprentices, not my friends, no one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For all the talk of shared dreaming, and all my dreaming with &amp;quot;sorcerers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;witches&amp;quot;, including Carlos, there was not one experience that completely convinced me shared dreaming is real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So back to &amp;quot;the line&amp;quot;.  To get me to cross, someone would have to prove dreaming CAN affect the physical universe we all share, OR prove dream worlds CAN be shared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dan and others here have convinced themselves dreaming phenomena are real. I&amp;#39;ve already read a lot of the accounts here, and still don&amp;#39;t understand how they are so convinced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know very well how many amazing things can *seem* real in dreaming. I also know very well how exciting aware dreaming can be, especially when you first learn and start getting good at it.  At first, it seemed incredible to me too.  I thought I was a real Luke Skywalker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And dreaming awake or lucid dreaming asleep makes little difference to me - similar brain functions are involved either way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People here appear to believe waking dreaming significantly differs from lucid dreaming. I was only able to enter dreaming from waking a few times over the years. I can count the times on one hand, but those few experiences did not *feel* that different to me. Perhaps because I did a lot of lucid dreaming using a &amp;quot;disciplined&amp;quot; method.  To me, entering dreaming from waking felt similar to many of the more realistic-seeming dreaming experiences I had involving &amp;quot;waking up&amp;quot; in exact copies of my room, and I had many of those experiences too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because I used &amp;quot;waking up into new dreaming scenes&amp;quot; as a main method of changing dreaming scenes, I had lots of experiences with false awakenings and sleep paralysis. I frequently experienced multiple false awakenings (it&amp;#39;s natural to believe you&amp;#39;re awake when you JUST woke up. That&amp;#39;s especially true when you &amp;quot;wake up&amp;quot; in the room you went to sleep in).  Indeed, those were always the most realistic dreaming experiences.  So the intense realism of waking dreaming was nothing new to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I experienced sleep paralysis many times too. After the first 3 or 4 times (slightly disturbing), I realized all you really need to do when this happens is to relax and *intend* either to wake up or to slide back into dreaming again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t see you guys mention how in sleep paralysis you can open your eyes and see the real room.  You may also see hypnagogia super-imposed on the room and this often freaks people out (believing it&amp;#39;s real). That hardly ever bothered me, but a few times I &amp;quot;woke up&amp;quot; to a face staring at me and jerked awake believing an intruder was there. Once it was a phantom and once it was my 6-year-old whom I punched before realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The secret to sleep paralysis is just don&amp;#39;t panic and don&amp;#39;t jump to ridiculous conclusions. Relax completely and intend either to wake up or to go back into dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now about &amp;quot;reading infinity&amp;quot;.... The quote below is from the book &amp;quot;No Man Knows My History - The Life of Joseph Smith&amp;quot; by Fawn M. Brodie:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Joseph Smith...would put the seer stone into a hat, and put his face in the hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the darkness the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing.  One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English... Thus the book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s a historical precursor to &amp;quot;reading infinity&amp;quot;.  You want to convert to Mormonism now?  :)  This might even be where Carlos got the idea?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos: &amp;quot;...the dot of pomegranate expands and finally explodes into thoughts or visions, or in the case of a literate man, into written words; sorcerers either see visions engendered by energy, hear thoughts being voiced as words, or read written words.&amp;quot; (Active Side)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would just ask you to notice how Joseph and Carlos read **completely different things** using such methods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The simplest explanation: what they &amp;quot;read&amp;quot; merely corresponded to their own beliefs.  (Notice, it&amp;#39;s not what they &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; either; it&amp;#39;s what they believe. Big difference.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Reading infinity&amp;quot; is a thing I thought I was about to succeed in as a believer in the 90s. I could see &amp;quot;lavender clouds&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;pomegranate dot&amp;quot; Carlos talked about and could even read words scrolling out of the images - although it was nearly impossible to make sense of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is still easy for me to see such things. If I get up to pee at night, I can see &amp;quot;purple clouds&amp;quot; with my eyes closed or open. If I get up and walk around the room I can still see them;  it doesn&amp;#39;t even have to be very dark and I don&amp;#39;t even have to be silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just last week I did that, and even got to where I could start to see &amp;quot;faces&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;purple clouds&amp;quot;.  I think that&amp;#39;s probably a fairly common visual phenomenon, and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s that hard to see such things.  I certainly don&amp;#39;t think it turns into &amp;quot;inorganic beings&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That same night, I went back to sleep and did some lucid dreaming (that&amp;#39;s still how I do dreaming) where I was with some people in a dark corner of an office all looking at hypnagogic images on a wall together.  :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learning to see the same forms over and over in dreaming imagery, as Dan apparently has (to some degree), is probably what convinces him there&amp;#39;s reality in what he perceives.  I&amp;#39;ll admit that&amp;#39;s impressive, for the tendency is for the imagery to morph around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see &amp;quot;bright white dots&amp;quot; if I focus on looking for them. I regularly see blotches of color and strange swirls and waves. I can see things looking at the sky, the ceiling, the walls, or darkness. I see detailed &amp;quot;hypnagogia&amp;quot; going to sleep or waking up. Gazing in darkness, it makes little difference whether my eyes are open or closed, suggesting that such &amp;quot;sights&amp;quot; relate to how the brain interprets visual information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure people can **make** what they see or read in hypnagogia seem to make sense (just as Joseph Smith did), and I know you can enter waking dreaming via those hypnagogia. I&amp;#39;ve entered dreaming that way a few times, but find it difficult and to succeed conditions need to be just right (that&amp;#39;s not how I learned it).  To be clear, I first learned dreaming by doing three main things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Practicing &amp;quot;the right way of walking&amp;quot; for hundreds of hours.  (My map said to.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Intending to become aware while inside dreams.  (And I got good at it.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Finding my hands, and then carefully examining the objects inside dreaming scenes (again, what my map said to do).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never met another person who did number 3 above verbatim as written anywhere near as many times as I did.

Carlos had used the terms \"intent\" and \"spirit\" before, but never wrote about \"it\" as a pervasive impersonal force in detail until then.  In earlier books, \"spirit\" usually refers to \"personal spirit\".  \n\nI first had an experience of \"the spirit\" inside lucid dreaming soon after first reading that book, purchased as a first edition right when it was released. \n\nFor me, the spirit \"descended\" only in dreaming states (\"shrouded\" as the book says).  Sometimes it literally took me places, overriding my personal will.  It taught me how to fly in dreaming (by \"beckoning the feeling\" of flying it had shown me).  If I try to describe better how it \\*felt\\*, I cannot do better than how Carlos described it, although he barely described it at all.\n\nHis description:  \"The only way to know intent... is to know it directly through a living connection.\"\n\nIn later books, Carlos described it as a \"vibratory force\" (Magical Passes). He also called it \"a tremor in the air\".  (Active Side)\n\nTo most people that probably sounds vague and incomprehensible. To me, in 1987 when it first touched me and took me flying and sometimes even controlled my actions in dreaming, those are almost perfect descriptions of what it \\*felt like\\*.  It felt like an encompassing \"vibratory tremor in the air\" that would \"hold\" my dreaming body.  It would encompass me and transport me to dreaming scenes. \n\nI didn't want to be a \"storm trooper\". I wanted to be \"a Jedi\".  :)\n\nWhen all this happened I was already two years into having \"a romance with knowledge\", having decided to return to college at age 28.  I was 31 in 1987 and thought I was literally learning to use \"the force\", although it was more like it was using me. \n\nEspecially inspiring was TPOS quote:   \"But there are examples of people, sorcerers or average men, who need no one. They get peace, harmony, laughter, knowledge, directly from the spirit. They need no intermediaries.\"  I thought that was who I was, since it seemed literally true.\n\nMy orientation was also \"poetic\" and had been, for years.  Carlos's poetic side greatly appealed to me, but I felt temperamentally closer to don Juan.  I had no desire to lead anyone and was more like a \"man behind the scenes\" type.  \n\nIf any of this path is real, I say what matters most is intent - not weird female beings living in tunnel worlds trying to imprison males.  Even if that did exist, I'm not sure I'd want much to do with it.  My orientation was more like don Juan's was later said to be.\n\nAside from how confusing it was for Carlos to tell us not to read his books (when all I had done for 10 years was based on them), it began to bother me for a different reason that I will explain.\n\nIn 1993, when The Art of Dreaming (TAOD) was published, I had been practicing dreaming for about 8 years. I'd had probably a couple of hundred lucid dreaming experiences by then, all of them inspired by CC's book instructions.  I had not yet read LaBerge or any other lucid dreaming authors.\n\nA great deal of that dreaming 1985-1993 involved switching between multiple dream scenes, using various methods of changing dreams, and then careful examination of the objects in the dream scenes, while gazing periodically at my hands, just as I'd been told.\n\nI don't know how many times I used that \"hand gazing technique\" verbatim -  probably a hundred times or more, enough that it had begun to seem a bit pointless since it wasn't even challenging any more, so I started focusing on more fun activities (like flying and other things that are impossible in waking). \n\nI developed many ways of intentionally changing scenes (before reading AOD which discusses that).  I had learned naturally that dreaming scenes often change by themselves without my own intent and without any overt intervention by \"it\".  First I just learned to cope when scene changes happened, and later learned to intend scene changes.\n\nOne thing that bothered me when I read TAOD was how in all the dreaming I'd done for years I had never seen anything like \"inorganic beings\". I was surprised to hear that these beings supposedly take an interest in dreamers at the \"2nd gate\", especially males.  \n\nThey hadn't taken any interest in me.  And I had carefully examined hundreds of dream objects in aware dreams and had changed scenes over and over while doing it. Nothing ever 'sizzled' or 'whizzed' or 'spoke in my ear' or 'whisked me away' (except \"the spirit\", which I'd read about in 1987).\n\nEventually my chief question became:  had I dreamed of \"the spirit\" simply because I'd read about it and it appealed to me?  Also, could it be that I had never dreamed of \"inorganic beings\" simply because I had \\*\\*not\\*\\* read about that (yet)?  \n\nThese concerns eventually led me to believe it was likely that everything I ever experienced in dreaming were just constructs of my own beliefs and likings.\n\nThroughout the first 8 years I practiced dreaming regularly, much of it at the so-called \"2nd gate\", I'd simply never been told that \"inorganic beings\" show up in dreaming.  So I never encountered any.  That is the simplest explanation.\n\nMeeting Carlos and studying under him beginning in Summer 1995 changed little in my dreaming. I had around 50-60 more aware dreaming experiences over the 2 years we studied with Carlos, but still no inorganic beings ever showed up. (Again, in spite of how they supposedly want male dreamers and now I even had a \"nagual\" and \"witches\" who claimed to live with them).  But... nope.  Still, no inorganics in my dreaming. \n\nIt's like... my mind just didn't really believe in them, so for me they didn't exist. No \"fliers\" ever showed up either.  My dreaming seems to reflect my own beliefs nearly exactly.\n\nIn the end, I decided that's one of the main limitations of dreaming: it simply reflects your own beliefs, wishes, and fears. It reflects your entire consciousness:  both your unconscious and conscious beliefs. Now that's cool and all - but not a revolution.\n\nWhen I first heard about \"fliers\" from Carlos in 1995, I decided he'd invented them as a \"worthy opponent\" for hundreds of students (I even wrote that in a forum then). In one post here, Dan said he believes that too.  So is that another \"add-on\"?  How many more do you suppose there are? How can you tell add-ons from real elements?\n\nCan you imagine a scientist going by such criteria?  \"Oh, I've experienced magnetic fields and I've manipulated electrons and photons in my research, but I don't believe quarks and gluons exist. I think my professors made those up to challenge me.\"  Yeah... right.  \n\nOne major thing did change in my dreaming while studying with Carlos. Many of my dreaming experiences began to involve other members of Carlos's group, including Carlos, and the witches. I began to have dreaming experiences with other members of our class. I even had a couple involving Dan. :)\n\nTalk about \"private\" classes?  I got to where I was attending realistic \"Tensegrity practices\" IN dreaming.  :)   I even \"discovered\" some of my own passes while dreaming.\n\nI was shown some strange things by Taisha in dreaming. I had dreaming experiences with Florinda, Nury, Nyei, Zaia (with Carola), Ellis, and others.\n\nAnd that's only what I can recall (if there is any reality to \"heightened awareness\", supposedly when dreaming with sorcerers I wouldn't be able to remember most of it until later in my training, right?).\n\nBut was any of it actually \"shared dreaming\"?  I don't know. It was never confirmed.  \n\nPeople love to assume they can share dreaming if they have experiences with people they know that seem to roughly correspond in each others' minds. But every time I've been able to rigorously analyze such claims they turn out to be fuzzy and flimsy. I was never able to validate that any dreaming was truly shared. None.\n\nThe simplest explanation is that it doesn't happen.\n\n(To be continued...)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g7fccvo", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first read about &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; in 1987 in The Power of Silence (TPOS).

My dreaming seems to reflect my own beliefs nearly exactly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, I decided that&amp;#39;s one of the main limitations of dreaming: it simply reflects your own beliefs, wishes, and fears. It reflects your entire consciousness:  both your unconscious and conscious beliefs. Now that&amp;#39;s cool and all - but not a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I first heard about &amp;quot;fliers&amp;quot; from Carlos in 1995, I decided he&amp;#39;d invented them as a &amp;quot;worthy opponent&amp;quot; for hundreds of students (I even wrote that in a forum then). In one post here, Dan said he believes that too.  So is that another &amp;quot;add-on&amp;quot;?  How many more do you suppose there are? How can you tell add-ons from real elements?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine a scientist going by such criteria?  &amp;quot;Oh, I&amp;#39;ve experienced magnetic fields and I&amp;#39;ve manipulated electrons and photons in my research, but I don&amp;#39;t believe quarks and gluons exist. I think my professors made those up to challenge me.&amp;quot;  Yeah... right.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One major thing did change in my dreaming while studying with Carlos. Many of my dreaming experiences began to involve other members of Carlos&amp;#39;s group, including Carlos, and the witches. I began to have dreaming experiences with other members of our class. I even had a couple involving Dan. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talk about &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; classes?  I got to where I was attending realistic &amp;quot;Tensegrity practices&amp;quot; IN dreaming.  :)   I even &amp;quot;discovered&amp;quot; some of my own passes while dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was shown some strange things by Taisha in dreaming. I had dreaming experiences with Florinda, Nury, Nyei, Zaia (with Carola), Ellis, and others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s only what I can recall (if there is any reality to &amp;quot;heightened awareness&amp;quot;, supposedly when dreaming with sorcerers I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to remember most of it until later in my training, right?).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But was any of it actually &amp;quot;shared dreaming&amp;quot;?  I don&amp;#39;t know. It was never confirmed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People love to assume they can share dreaming if they have experiences with people they know that seem to roughly correspond in each others&amp;#39; minds. But every time I&amp;#39;ve been able to rigorously analyze such claims they turn out to be fuzzy and flimsy. I was never able to validate that any dreaming was truly shared. None.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The simplest explanation is that it doesn&amp;#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(To be continued...)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ilihbu", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ilihbu/lineage/g7fccvo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1601662618.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g49wnab", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "JohnThursday2020", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1599430866.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ilihbu", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_5vqvkvdv", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "A big problem with lineages is how they're based in authority.

That reason:   the spirit dictates and you acquiesce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus, we always come to a question like:  what is the spirit?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, the nagual throws you in the river, and you either get it or you don't.

In fact, Carlos stated that his books were written by that ultimate authority, \"intent\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA question:  if Carlos had not \"acquired membership\", as he just said, how could he do that?   But the nagual has authority, so we must take his word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUno Mismo Interview, 1997:  \"It is intent which decides a shaman's production, whether it be literary or of any other kind...

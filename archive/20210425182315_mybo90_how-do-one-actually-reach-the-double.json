Remember, the double is the portion of us which escaped imprisonment here. It's a separate portion of our energy.\n\nThe \"energy body\" is a conversion of the trapped portion, to a more freeing body type. We \"redeploy\" its energy from the outside, to the inside.\n\nNothing to do with the escaped portion of energy.\n\nAnd, since I've seen both of those many times, the usual \"worry\" about contradictions which plagues the Castaneda community does not apply.\n\nThat would be the \"oh no, we don't understand this, and that's why it's not working!\"\n\nIt is working now.\n\nSo I suppose, we can try to figure out why there's some disagreement.\n\nBut it's a tall order.  I always found the women's comments to be opposed to what I believed Carlos had said in the past.\n\nBut it's always turned out they weren't.\n\nIt would be nice to compare your quotes against other quotes indicating they are not the same thing, so we can try to refine this.\n\nSo SAVE THOSE, in case they get burried.\n\nAnd, darkroom gazing lets you experience the two of them, so it's probably the best way to understand this in the long run.\n\nSo far we've seen that the double sort of \"mixes in\" with your physical body in the darkroom, reaching out to help with things.\n\nI've seen it sitting on the edge of the bed, and yet, my physical body is the one that converts to the energy body, when you glance down to switch over.\n\nAnd we're mainly building the \"energy body\", so we can switch over to it.\n\nAnd when you switch over, your tonal body disappears.

Generous even, when it&amp;#39;s aware of my presence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her double can move solid objects, but not with much force.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they can be solid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;#39;re talking about weird stuff, did anyone notice the contradiction in our understanding?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It flowed through here recently, as a random topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we are simply awareness granted to us by the Eagle, swimming around exploring the body of the Eagle (the dark sea), and then we accidentally collided with the intent of this world, and &amp;quot;were born&amp;quot;, how did we end up with a physical body we can&amp;#39;t seem to get rid of?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did we pick up matter from this place, and our physical body is just that matter?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The IOBs have to make 2 tries to kidnap us. Once to kidnap our awareness, but then they have to send back 10 of  their buddies, to snatch the physical matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do they even want that stuff?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you switch to a cyclic being, which Carlos explained you could keep if you wanted, what happens to the physical matter here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You go into a coma?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But worst of all, how come the 3rd attention &amp;quot;unifies&amp;quot; the planet of the kidney, with the planet of the liver, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How come those matter at all?  Are they not merely physical matter we picked up here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somehow they&amp;#39;re important to our transformation?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that it matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing else out there. No magic in any other system, that&amp;#39;s worth even a little of our effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if there&amp;#39;s a seeming contradiction, that only matters as much as baby cockroaches running out of the lid of the ketchup bottle when you open it, at your favorite restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With no other places to eat in 100 miles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;ve actually seen that.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what sort of &amp;quot;heaven&amp;quot; you go to, is a completely different topic, if you want real magic in your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;quot;contradictions&amp;quot; people occasionally bring here, as if it&amp;#39;s something to worry about, are pointless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have no place to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jeremy was the king of &amp;quot;contradictions&amp;quot;.  21 instead of 20.

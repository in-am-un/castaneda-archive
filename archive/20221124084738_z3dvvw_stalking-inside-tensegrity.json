And nearly the loss of the whole thing, when people freely trashed the reputation of Carlos, pointing out it doesn't work.\n\nNot anymore!  It's revenge time.\n\nSorry Yoda.\n\nAnd no one can challenge the \"I'm a stalker\" lie,   because just a tiny temper tantrum to bully them to stop it, works.\n\nOr so fakers believe.\n\nIt's the old, \"How can you possibly know I'm making things up?\"\n\nWorks everywhere else!\n\nWell...\n\nNot only can we know, but it's so obvious that people who make it to the red zone, are literally blushing red when they read that kind of pretending.\n\nEmbarrassed for the \"stalkers\".  And seeing how hopeless it is that they'll ever learn.\n\nYou have to understand clearly what our situation is, to gain the right perspective and fight off the common enemies on the path.\n\nThere's fear of course.  And then \"clarity\".\n\nI don't quite get the clarity one. It's possible that's just a \"Man of Knowledge\" delusion.\n\nBecause the cure for clarity is easy!\n\nMore silence.\n\nNothing stays the same, with more silence.  Any \"coolness\" you managed to discover, any stunning magic you can pat  yourself on the back over which might lead to arrogance or too much self-confidence so that you stop being creative in figuring out how to move further, is overcome just by remembering to gain deeper silence.\n\nCarlos became greedy for more silence, even becoming fry cook \"Joe Cordoba\", the master of eggs.\n\nTaisha became a homeless woman.\n\nThey engaged in stalking, to deepen their silence.\n\nThen there's Amy's book.\n\n\"The abomination\" which Carlos gleefully nagged Amy to write on his death.  Trust me, I saw it coming years before it was published. Carlos didn't hide that he wanted her to do that.\n\nWhat has that to do with stalking?\n\nIt's indirect, but some of you will be able to see this.  And I'd like to save it here for me to remember later,  to animate.\n\nDon't think Carlos didn't try that.  He resorted to having someone paint a picture of \"Reading Off the Wall\", and even handed it out at workshops.\n\nBut the software back then couldn't possibly support the kinds of things we can do now.\n\nWe can \"tell stories\".  Teach sorcery through stories!\n\nAs it always has been, in the advanced stages.\n\nThere's the \"abstract cores\".\n\nWhich naturally bad men stole so they could pretend to have \"uncovered\" more of those, and steal based on the misunderstanding of Castaneda fans that sorcery is something ordinary and you can learn it just by becoming an expert on the inventory of sorcery \"facts\".\n\nFake students believe that being able to name off all the cores, and even give the story that goes with each, is any progress in the path of learning sorcery.\n\nIn fact, it's just the path to becoming a fraud and plaguing the community by discouraging people from facing the facts.\n\nYou have to follow instructions and work hard. There is no other path.\n\nAnd so if you try to do what we're doing in here, it's a constant battle to figure out how to make people be serious without triggering the inevitable tantrums people use to blackmail others not to expose their pretending.\n\nThey \"want something\" from this subreddit.\n\nBut it's not magic.  Likely they don't really even believe that crap.\n\nSo back to Amy's book.\n\nHow do you handle a needy person?  Who comes here, won't read old posts, and wants to ask questions they could easily answer themselves by taking advantage of the wiki.\n\nThey beg for help, using questions that stink of \"poor me, I suffer so much.  Please help me.\"\n\nRight there, that person is doomed. They'll never learn.\n\nAt least not by our method.\n\nThe old seers never faced that at all.\n\nThey got \"apprentices\" as children.  I'd estimate that the age you see in Star Wars, is correct.  That's possibly our old witch Soledad at work.\n\n4 or 5 years old looked like the tops to me, if you extrapolated the \"younglings\" Yoda was teaching back to when they must have started.\n\n3 year olds are programmed to want nothing more than to please the adults around them, and they don't question anything.  And their biggest \"book deals\" involve pleasing their bad boy uncle.\n\nThere were \"Men of Knowledge\" back then too, but those guys were lame profiteers.\n\nThere's no profit in small children.\n\nSo their situation with \"benefactors\" ought to be tossed out entirely, if you want to actually learn.\n\nAnd if you found a man out there who pretended to be your benefactor, I have to be quite frankly suggest he's after your butt.\n\nHe'll drug you up, and date rape you.\n\nSo please don't be so proud that \"I have a benefactor\".  Nearly everyone sees through that fiasco.\n\nAnyone with any success seeing magic has silenced enough to instantly know, that man is screwed.  A \"benefactor\" is the sign of failure.\n\nA total misunderstanding.\n\nOne might not care how many fish you lose when you cast as broad of a net as this subreddit does.\n\nBut it's hard to just give up on people.\n\nIt's also very unpleasant to deal with them.\n\nThat is literally what killed Carlos.\n\nThere's no doubt in that, he told us more times than I can recall.\n\nThat his only chance to survive his cancer was to \"jump grooves\".\n\nVery advanced and super cool, but back then it sounded nutty.\n\nThese days, any of you has a chance to visibly see what he was talking about.\n\nBut he didn't have enough energy left.\n\nAnd the workshop and private class crowd never managed to raise their energy level above their ankles.\n\nThose who got it that high wasted it immediately, within a week.  He even warned us, each time appraising our levels so we could think back to what we did just yesterday that could have bled off the energy he saw we had gained.\n\nClasses were often that close together.  Deliberately I suspect.  It was \"real time teaching\" and we failed.\n\nLeaving Carlos doomed.\n\nYou could tell when he realized he had to die.  He started to promise to show us magic directly.\n\nWhich he did, despite everyone thinking he had failed.\n\nBack to Amy's book.  How did Carlos deal with crappy recruits?\n\nHe couldn't do as often happens in here.\n\nThe women don't like it, but we can say \"Get lost butthead.  There's no chance in hell for you and you'll only drag everyone else down.\"\n\nIt really pisses people off because no other \"system\" is going to do that.  They need every customer they can get!\n\nEven down in the bowels of the oddest \"magic\" subreddit, such as the TM subreddit surviving after all this time without Maharishi around to wave daisies at hippies, they're welcoming and helpful. Unless you question them.  Then their heads start to explode.\n\nBecause Maharishi set up little franchises. Anyone who completed \"teacher training\" ($3000+ in the 70s) can teach that simple form of meditation. Which is not customer tailored at all.\n\nIt's simply the mantra \"Aing\".  An internal dialogue substitute to reduce the chatter. You do a little ceremony with some burning camphor, chant, and you get to charge $1200.\n\nSo naturally new people are WELCOME in the TM subreddit.\n\nSame for all the other pretend magic. It may not be obvious, but there's always profit motivation  at the bottom of it.\n\nBecause in fact they have no magic. So there's no \"Oh my god, magic is so cool!\" motivations.\n\nNo desire to \"save this for mankind\".\n\nIt's only profit masked as spirituality.\n\nI'm kind of reminding myself of what I just \"saw\" in the air a while ago, as a multimedia style presentation of silent knowledge.  You can get lost in that!  And lose most of it.\n\nI don't want to forget this because it will work out well in animations.\n\nIf you had an animation for gymnasts, and at the end the gymnast loses balance on \"touch down\", ruining the entire routine as far as the audience goes, a person learning from the video isn't insulted or upset by an animated commentator saying, \"Gee Bob, that touchdown really failed.  That's got to hurt!\"\n\nBut in person, it leads to crying in the locker room.\n\nSo animations can be brutal to the characters, and the audience can learn from it without tears.\n\nIn person, people are such cry babies it's no wonder only people who are profit motivated will put up with trying to teach.\n\nBut the old seers didn't have that consideration. They were given pre-school age children.  Who were eager to copy and follow instructions.\n\nThe new seers likewise didn't try to teach individuals.\n\nBecause it's impossible!\n\nThis subreddit is proof of that.  Only 1 in 100 who claim to be interested will actually try.\n\n10 of those are angry babies seeking attention.  Who aren't even serious.\n\nWith a flow of 2000 a year, there's no way anyone can afford to worry about individuals.\n\nAnd no way to help them.\n\nIt's not possible to teach sorcery to an individual.  No one can do that.\n\nAnd not the lineages either.\n\nThey were \"given\" people by the spirit, each selected to replace a member of the old lineage because of an energetic configuration only a seer could see.\n\nAnd then they found some deception to keep that person around, while the Nagual drugged them up with the Nagual's blow and taught them in deep heightened awareness.\n\nWhere the very air exudes magic and knowledge.  And bliss beyond a Yogi's wildest dreams.\n\nWith eyes open, eating food at a little restaurant.\n\nIt's light years beyond any other system.\n\nEasy to teach even the worst person in that state.\n\nIf the tonal side of their apprentices  caused too much trouble even for the lineages, they had 15 powerful sorcerers to use to trick and guide them.\n\nMost unknown to the apprentice.\n\nAnd at the worst if a person was serious trouble, one of the waking dreamers in the group would just pick them up by the back of the neck, and toss them into the second attention to survive on their own.\n\nFor an attitude adjustment.\n\nBy the way, Cholita can do that.  So don't doubt it.  I've been \"tossed\" a few times.\n\nIt's very scary until you realize what a rare gift it is to be around someone that powerful.\n\nEven if they're crazy.\n\nI hope it's clear, no one has ever done what we're trying to do here.\n\nExcept Carlos.\n\nWhich brings me to Amy's book.\n\nAmy's book preserves what no one would have written notes about in any detail.\n\nWhat no one would notice or care about.\n\nHow Carlos dealt with teaching cry babies.\n\nHer book comes off to people as an \"expose\" on how horrible and twisted this \"cult leader\" was.\n\nBut the truth is, all of sorcery comes off as an evil fraud.\n\nYou'll find out when you're up to your ears in magic so startling, it exceeds that of any religion out there.\n\nKicks the butt of it all!\n\nAnd while the world loves their religion, they won't want to hear about the real thing.\n\nHow can that be?\n\nJust wait for it.  You'll get to see.\n\nIt's a mistake to even try to interest the people you know, for all the reasons just explained and more.\n\nBut it's good practice in dealing with circular reasoning from someone who is stuck at the blue line on that J curve diagram we use to teach people. Given to us by Carlos.\n\nIf you make an astonishingly good effort to explain it, so that they have to admit it doesn't sound as crazy as they first thought, you get a \"breakthrough\".\n\nThey'll say, \"Well then, we need to document this!  Prove it.  How can we do that?\"\n\nWhat???!\n\nThe first inclination of anyone who doesn't turn and walk away to trash your \"mental health\" from then on, is \"how can we profit from this, financially and with fame.\"\n\nIt's hopeless.\n\nTo even try to \"talk them down\" from that thought, requires even more energy.\n\nYou'd have to explain why \"the book deal mind\" kills any ability to move the assemblage point. Convince them that's just not a \"lame excuse\" like other systems use to explain why they don't actually have any magic you can see.\n\nAnd so that while it's possible to \"prove it\", seeing as how Cholita defies reality, thinking of doing that from the start means a person can never learn.\n\nAnd if someone put that out of their own mind for decades, so they could learn, by the time they reached Cholita's skill level they would have no interest at all in \"proving magic\" to anyone.\n\nWhy?\n\nMoney isn't worth anything, compared to magic.  And if pursuing it causes you to experience less magic, it's a tragic loss.\n\nYou can't gain actual students that way.\n\nTry to \"prove it\", so that you get stuck with a student who will only make you miserable and then fail to learn anything at all?\n\nAs Carlos had.\n\nIf this all sounds harsh, it wouldn't in a well done animation.\n\nIt would seem more like an Aesop's fable, with a valuable moral lesson hidden in the story.\n\nSuch as, evil witches can be burned up in ovens, and will try to lure you with candy.\n\nWait...\n\nWrong fairy tale.\n\nBut fortunately we have Amy's book to help us understand how Carlos dealt with individuals.\n\nI have no idea how much there is in it, of that.\n\nBut anytime Carlos paired people off, or had them engaged in a project together, he was trying to turn cry babies into teachable students.\n\nNow you might be thinking, \"What the hell does this have to do with the puffs??\"\n\nEVERYTHING.\n\nI got a little rush of Yoda excitement there, getting to say that!\n\nHow did his speech go?\n\n\"Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to SUFFERING.\"\n\nAmy's book hopefully shows how Carlos dealt with the neediness and bad motivations of people, by trying to give them practical tasks or \"companionship\".\n\nAnd the magical side of that is right there in the puffs.\n\nStaring you right in the face!\n\nHere's the rules:\n\nFirst rule: If you see ANYTHING that isn't really there, in silence, it will move your assemblage point down the J curve.\n\nYou need the silence so that assemblage point can move.  Your internal dialogue is all about the blue line on the J curve diagram.  So while it's running you are \"tied to the dock\".  Your raft can't drift in the dark sea of awareness.\n\nSecond rule:  if you treat anything as \"real\", your assemblage point moves sideways to make it more real.\n\nSo first you look for puffs, and those will pull you to the green line if you are silent.\n\nThen you get to deepen your silence, by observing how brilliant the puffs are. You now have a \"puff meter\" to measure your progress.\n\nSecond rule comes into effect.\n\nYou see a very brilliant puff, and know you are now in the red zone where shapeshifting is possible.\n\nTreat it as real!\n\nIt's a magic ball.\n\nGrab it, stretch it, flip it into the air, and it will settle down to materialize all sorts of cool stuff.\n\nI made a little \"clown car\" once.  Just wondering if I could.\n\nI turned into a frog a day or two before that, but there was no way to know I was actually a frog.  And I didn't want to hop outside and eat bugs, even I could have opened the door.\n\nSo I made a clown car just 2 feet high!  Right on the floor of my darkroom.\n\nThen I wondered how many clowns can fit in that car.\n\nTo summarize, I treated a puff as real, and so my assemblage point shifted horizontally in the deep red zone.\n\nMAGIC SUPREME down there.\n\nSo I manufactured a clown car for real.  Please don't whine to me that you can't \"feel the puffs\", so how can you stretch them?!\n\nThat's blue line thinking.  If you get to the red you'll figure out how.  Mostly, not care if you feel them since you can see it working.  But in fact, you can ALSO feel them if you are super silent.  More silence than needed just to stretch one.\n\nThen I treated it even more real!\n\nBy just casually assuming real \"mini clowns\" could get into it and drive away.  And I could count them.\n\nSo I shifted horizontally even further just by accepting it as real and thinking about it BEYOND, \"That's soooo cool!\"\n\nI started to think about how to use it.\n\nI thought of it as \"real\" by my willingness to fantasize about trying to stuff clowns in there.\n\nI shifted further right, and shape shifted to just 1.5 feet tall.\n\nAnd unfortunately got into the little car.\n\nFortunately, there were no clowns around.  Clowns are evil.\n\nBig mistake to climb in.\n\nThat's entry to dreaming.  That's literally \"passing through the wall of fog\".\n\nI lost my rationality.\n\nMy link to the memory used in our normal life did not join me, so I drove off into oblivion.\n\nWoke up the next morning with virtually no memory of that at all.\n\nStalking is the driving force here.  It was stalking, to pretend a puff can be real.\n\nIt was even better stalking to pretend, you can form a puff into a real object.\n\nAnd then stalking supreme, to get into it and drive away!\n\nTHAT'S stalking.\n\nPranking other people is not.\n\nWe miss the nature of the stalking events in the books.\n\nWe fail to see that when Carlos first met some of the lineage's people and they pretended to be shoppers he just bumped into on the street, spilling their packages, they were pretending to be that so well he couldn't tell.\n\nThey literally \"took it as real\".\n\nThey taught him how to move his assemblage point sideways.  The way sorcerers do.\n\nKeep in mind, you MUST do that when your assemblage point is so far along on the J curve, that reality is unstable.\n\nBut all the readers saw was,  they got to make fun of Carlos for being inferior to them.\n\nHe wasn't \"in on their secrets\".\n\nThe Castaneda community went straight for the book deal. For attention seeking.\n\nFor sitting on a little \"Zen Master\" throne, to lord it over the sad monks while barely tolerating their ignorance.\n\nVery ugly.\n\nBut in fact, climbing into clown cars is the truth of stalking.  You might even get a little red nose, so that you don't think to get a fat head over it.\n\nMaking something that is clearly not there, and not real, become real by treating it as such.\n\nAnd not just as make believe, so you can use that story later to impress your friends at how cleverly you work with sorcery.\n\nThere's so much more to this.\n\nWhat you see that isn't there becomes real.\n\nBut then, how you feel about it becomes real.\n\nIt's the \"next level of stalking\" in darkroom.\n\nAll attained, using Tensegrity.\n\nSo it's really, the stalking hidden in tensegrity.\n\nDon't believe me?\n\nGo watch Jadey form her \"energy body knees\", in the Affection for the energy body pass.\n\nShe forms a head too, as if you can mold puffs and they stay in place.\n\nShe literally sculpts herself, and then gives it a big hug at the end as if it were now real.\n\nAnd possibly Little Smoke the entity approves, since she knows we're trying to save the teachings, and gives us a demo of  the gurgling teapot that Carlos also showed us in private classes.  Right in that video.\n\nAnalyze that.  There's at least 2 levels of stalking there.\n\nBut there's more!  The levels of stalking never end in darkroom.\n\nI'll try to list them.\n\nI got a lecture on it just a while ago.\n\n1 Treat it as real.\n\n2 Use it as real.\n\n3 Expect it's context all around you.\n\n(that engages the will)\n\n4 Accept what it now is, with no trace of doubt.\n\n(it's your new reality so don't reject the emerging Nagual, or the abstract).\n\n5 Accept that there are others there with you.\n\n(don't pee your pants when the double shows up or you find yourself with the inorganic beings, in their world).\n\nPeople say, the books don't have much on stalking.\n\nTrue.\n\nIt's in the tensegrity!\n\nAND, in Amy's book.\n\nJust don't expect me to read that monstrosity.\n\nI'll go find that Yoda picture...\n\nWhich illustrates how to motivate women.\n\nInspire them!\n\nNot that Yoda inspires the women.\n\nThat's just my obsession because of Cholita's weird connection to Carlos selling imported art and Soledad using money to influence Hollywood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Stalking Inside Tensegrity", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Stalking"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"uqjj93almu1a1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uqjj93almu1a1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06f2adb08d1a378995782c19d66e3cf71e5a208b"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uqjj93almu1a1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ddc62ede9248af2ad10311145529b62dffa35c4"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uqjj93almu1a1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0b1888af5c943704c065fae505a7529e73dc720"}, {"y": 480, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uqjj93almu1a1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bea2e618c24a86fa0657f7b780f831c0f357e28c"}, {"y": 720, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uqjj93almu1a1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=650178e9ffa5bab8780b14c5a7fee97ebf324367"}, {"y": 810, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uqjj93almu1a1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07452a1b7e092aa90934adbc73f374111276f74b"}], "s": {"y": 1125, "x": 1500, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uqjj93almu1a1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebee5e89b8784bc91e7497b7f4f77a8e6e7e4390"}, "id": "uqjj93almu1a1"}}, "name": "t3_z3dvvw", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Stalking", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/T5aQJUf2UUjuSLJRkTJmgNacT1iAtQQQ6ow55SIBFoc.jpg", "edited": 1669305179.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1669276058.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uqjj93almu1a1.png?width=1500&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ebee5e89b8784bc91e7497b7f4f77a8e6e7e4390\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/uqjj93almu1a1.png?width=1500&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ebee5e89b8784bc91e7497b7f4f77a8e6e7e4390&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stalking&amp;quot; is one of those sorcery topics you can pretend to be doing, in order to make excuses for why you aren&amp;#39;t doing something that actually produces magical results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire Castaneda community did pretending like that, resulting in total failure to learn real magic.

And seeing how hopeless it is that they&amp;#39;ll ever learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to understand clearly what our situation is, to gain the right perspective and fight off the common enemies on the path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s fear of course.  And then &amp;quot;clarity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t quite get the clarity one. It&amp;#39;s possible that&amp;#39;s just a &amp;quot;Man of Knowledge&amp;quot; delusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the cure for clarity is easy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing stays the same, with more silence.  Any &amp;quot;coolness&amp;quot; you managed to discover, any stunning magic you can pat  yourself on the back over which might lead to arrogance or too much self-confidence so that you stop being creative in figuring out how to move further, is overcome just by remembering to gain deeper silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos became greedy for more silence, even becoming fry cook &amp;quot;Joe Cordoba&amp;quot;, the master of eggs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taisha became a homeless woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They engaged in stalking, to deepen their silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s Amy&amp;#39;s book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The abomination&amp;quot; which Carlos gleefully nagged Amy to write on his death.  Trust me, I saw it coming years before it was published. Carlos didn&amp;#39;t hide that he wanted her to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What has that to do with stalking?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s indirect, but some of you will be able to see this.  And I&amp;#39;d like to save it here for me to remember later,  to animate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t think Carlos didn&amp;#39;t try that.  He resorted to having someone paint a picture of &amp;quot;Reading Off the Wall&amp;quot;, and even handed it out at workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the software back then couldn&amp;#39;t possibly support the kinds of things we can do now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can &amp;quot;tell stories&amp;quot;.  Teach sorcery through stories!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it always has been, in the advanced stages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;abstract cores&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which naturally bad men stole so they could pretend to have &amp;quot;uncovered&amp;quot; more of those, and steal based on the misunderstanding of Castaneda fans that sorcery is something ordinary and you can learn it just by becoming an expert on the inventory of sorcery &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fake students believe that being able to name off all the cores, and even give the story that goes with each, is any progress in the path of learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#39;s just the path to becoming a fraud and plaguing the community by discouraging people from facing the facts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to follow instructions and work hard. There is no other path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so if you try to do what we&amp;#39;re doing in here, it&amp;#39;s a constant battle to figure out how to make people be serious without triggering the inevitable tantrums people use to blackmail others not to expose their pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They &amp;quot;want something&amp;quot; from this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not magic.  Likely they don&amp;#39;t really even believe that crap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So back to Amy&amp;#39;s book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you handle a needy person?  Who comes here, won&amp;#39;t read old posts, and wants to ask questions they could easily answer themselves by taking advantage of the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They beg for help, using questions that stink of &amp;quot;poor me, I suffer so much.  Please help me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right there, that person is doomed. They&amp;#39;ll never learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least not by our method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old seers never faced that at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They got &amp;quot;apprentices&amp;quot; as children.  I&amp;#39;d estimate that the age you see in Star Wars, is correct.  That&amp;#39;s possibly our old witch Soledad at work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 or 5 years old looked like the tops to me, if you extrapolated the &amp;quot;younglings&amp;quot; Yoda was teaching back to when they must have started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 year olds are programmed to want nothing more than to please the adults around them, and they don&amp;#39;t question anything.  And their biggest &amp;quot;book deals&amp;quot; involve pleasing their bad boy uncle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot; back then too, but those guys were lame profiteers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no profit in small children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So their situation with &amp;quot;benefactors&amp;quot; ought to be tossed out entirely, if you want to actually learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you found a man out there who pretended to be your benefactor, I have to be quite frankly suggest he&amp;#39;s after your butt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;ll drug you up, and date rape you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So please don&amp;#39;t be so proud that &amp;quot;I have a benefactor&amp;quot;.  Nearly everyone sees through that fiasco.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone with any success seeing magic has silenced enough to instantly know, that man is screwed.  A &amp;quot;benefactor&amp;quot; is the sign of failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A total misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One might not care how many fish you lose when you cast as broad of a net as this subreddit does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s hard to just give up on people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also very unpleasant to deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is literally what killed Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no doubt in that, he told us more times than I can recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That his only chance to survive his cancer was to &amp;quot;jump grooves&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very advanced and super cool, but back then it sounded nutty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These days, any of you has a chance to visibly see what he was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he didn&amp;#39;t have enough energy left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the workshop and private class crowd never managed to raise their energy level above their ankles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those who got it that high wasted it immediately, within a week.  He even warned us, each time appraising our levels so we could think back to what we did just yesterday that could have bled off the energy he saw we had gained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Classes were often that close together.  Deliberately I suspect.  It was &amp;quot;real time teaching&amp;quot; and we failed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leaving Carlos doomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could tell when he realized he had to die.  He started to promise to show us magic directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which he did, despite everyone thinking he had failed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to Amy&amp;#39;s book.  How did Carlos deal with crappy recruits?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He couldn&amp;#39;t do as often happens in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women don&amp;#39;t like it, but we can say &amp;quot;Get lost butthead.  There&amp;#39;s no chance in hell for you and you&amp;#39;ll only drag everyone else down.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really pisses people off because no other &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; is going to do that.  They need every customer they can get!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even down in the bowels of the oddest &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; subreddit, such as the TM subreddit surviving after all this time without Maharishi around to wave daisies at hippies, they&amp;#39;re welcoming and helpful. Unless you question them.  Then their heads start to explode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because Maharishi set up little franchises. Anyone who completed &amp;quot;teacher training&amp;quot; ($3000+ in the 70s) can teach that simple form of meditation. Which is not customer tailored at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s simply the mantra &amp;quot;Aing&amp;quot;.  An internal dialogue substitute to reduce the chatter. You do a little ceremony with some burning camphor, chant, and you get to charge $1200.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So naturally new people are WELCOME in the TM subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for all the other pretend magic. It may not be obvious, but there&amp;#39;s always profit motivation  at the bottom of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because in fact they have no magic. So there&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;Oh my god, magic is so cool!&amp;quot; motivations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No desire to &amp;quot;save this for mankind&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only profit masked as spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m kind of reminding myself of what I just &amp;quot;saw&amp;quot; in the air a while ago, as a multimedia style presentation of silent knowledge.  You can get lost in that!  And lose most of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to forget this because it will work out well in animations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you had an animation for gymnasts, and at the end the gymnast loses balance on &amp;quot;touch down&amp;quot;, ruining the entire routine as far as the audience goes, a person learning from the video isn&amp;#39;t insulted or upset by an animated commentator saying, &amp;quot;Gee Bob, that touchdown really failed.  That&amp;#39;s got to hurt!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in person, it leads to crying in the locker room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So animations can be brutal to the characters, and the audience can learn from it without tears.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In person, people are such cry babies it&amp;#39;s no wonder only people who are profit motivated will put up with trying to teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the old seers didn&amp;#39;t have that consideration. They were given pre-school age children.  Who were eager to copy and follow instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new seers likewise didn&amp;#39;t try to teach individuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s impossible!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This subreddit is proof of that.  Only 1 in 100 who claim to be interested will actually try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 of those are angry babies seeking attention.  Who aren&amp;#39;t even serious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a flow of 2000 a year, there&amp;#39;s no way anyone can afford to worry about individuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no way to help them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not possible to teach sorcery to an individual.  No one can do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not the lineages either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were &amp;quot;given&amp;quot; people by the spirit, each selected to replace a member of the old lineage because of an energetic configuration only a seer could see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then they found some deception to keep that person around, while the Nagual drugged them up with the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow and taught them in deep heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where the very air exudes magic and knowledge.  And bliss beyond a Yogi&amp;#39;s wildest dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With eyes open, eating food at a little restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s light years beyond any other system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Easy to teach even the worst person in that state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the tonal side of their apprentices  caused too much trouble even for the lineages, they had 15 powerful sorcerers to use to trick and guide them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most unknown to the apprentice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And at the worst if a person was serious trouble, one of the waking dreamers in the group would just pick them up by the back of the neck, and toss them into the second attention to survive on their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For an attitude adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, Cholita can do that.  So don&amp;#39;t doubt it.  I&amp;#39;ve been &amp;quot;tossed&amp;quot; a few times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very scary until you realize what a rare gift it is to be around someone that powerful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if they&amp;#39;re crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope it&amp;#39;s clear, no one has ever done what we&amp;#39;re trying to do here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to Amy&amp;#39;s book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amy&amp;#39;s book preserves what no one would have written notes about in any detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What no one would notice or care about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How Carlos dealt with teaching cry babies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her book comes off to people as an &amp;quot;expose&amp;quot; on how horrible and twisted this &amp;quot;cult leader&amp;quot; was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, all of sorcery comes off as an evil fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll find out when you&amp;#39;re up to your ears in magic so startling, it exceeds that of any religion out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kicks the butt of it all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while the world loves their religion, they won&amp;#39;t want to hear about the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How can that be?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just wait for it.  You&amp;#39;ll get to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a mistake to even try to interest the people you know, for all the reasons just explained and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s good practice in dealing with circular reasoning from someone who is stuck at the blue line on that J curve diagram we use to teach people. Given to us by Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you make an astonishingly good effort to explain it, so that they have to admit it doesn&amp;#39;t sound as crazy as they first thought, you get a &amp;quot;breakthrough&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll say, &amp;quot;Well then, we need to document this!  Prove it.  How can we do that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What???!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first inclination of anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t turn and walk away to trash your &amp;quot;mental health&amp;quot; from then on, is &amp;quot;how can we profit from this, financially and with fame.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To even try to &amp;quot;talk them down&amp;quot; from that thought, requires even more energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d have to explain why &amp;quot;the book deal mind&amp;quot; kills any ability to move the assemblage point. Convince them that&amp;#39;s just not a &amp;quot;lame excuse&amp;quot; like other systems use to explain why they don&amp;#39;t actually have any magic you can see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so that while it&amp;#39;s possible to &amp;quot;prove it&amp;quot;, seeing as how Cholita defies reality, thinking of doing that from the start means a person can never learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if someone put that out of their own mind for decades, so they could learn, by the time they reached Cholita&amp;#39;s skill level they would have no interest at all in &amp;quot;proving magic&amp;quot; to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Money isn&amp;#39;t worth anything, compared to magic.  And if pursuing it causes you to experience less magic, it&amp;#39;s a tragic loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t gain actual students that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to &amp;quot;prove it&amp;quot;, so that you get stuck with a student who will only make you miserable and then fail to learn anything at all?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Carlos had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this all sounds harsh, it wouldn&amp;#39;t in a well done animation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would seem more like an Aesop&amp;#39;s fable, with a valuable moral lesson hidden in the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as, evil witches can be burned up in ovens, and will try to lure you with candy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wrong fairy tale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But fortunately we have Amy&amp;#39;s book to help us understand how Carlos dealt with individuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how much there is in it, of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But anytime Carlos paired people off, or had them engaged in a project together, he was trying to turn cry babies into teachable students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you might be thinking, &amp;quot;What the hell does this have to do with the puffs??&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EVERYTHING.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a little rush of Yoda excitement there, getting to say that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did his speech go?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to SUFFERING.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amy&amp;#39;s book hopefully shows how Carlos dealt with the neediness and bad motivations of people, by trying to give them practical tasks or &amp;quot;companionship&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the magical side of that is right there in the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Staring you right in the face!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the rules:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First rule: If you see ANYTHING that isn&amp;#39;t really there, in silence, it will move your assemblage point down the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need the silence so that assemblage point can move.  Your internal dialogue is all about the blue line on the J curve diagram.  So while it&amp;#39;s running you are &amp;quot;tied to the dock&amp;quot;.  Your raft can&amp;#39;t drift in the dark sea of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second rule:  if you treat anything as &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;, your assemblage point moves sideways to make it more real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So first you look for puffs, and those will pull you to the green line if you are silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you get to deepen your silence, by observing how brilliant the puffs are. You now have a &amp;quot;puff meter&amp;quot; to measure your progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second rule comes into effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see a very brilliant puff, and know you are now in the red zone where shapeshifting is possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Treat it as real!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a magic ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grab it, stretch it, flip it into the air, and it will settle down to materialize all sorts of cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made a little &amp;quot;clown car&amp;quot; once.  Just wondering if I could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned into a frog a day or two before that, but there was no way to know I was actually a frog.  And I didn&amp;#39;t want to hop outside and eat bugs, even I could have opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I made a clown car just 2 feet high!  Right on the floor of my darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I wondered how many clowns can fit in that car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To summarize, I treated a puff as real, and so my assemblage point shifted horizontally in the deep red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MAGIC SUPREME down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I manufactured a clown car for real.  Please don&amp;#39;t whine to me that you can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;feel the puffs&amp;quot;, so how can you stretch them?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s blue line thinking.  If you get to the red you&amp;#39;ll figure out how.  Mostly, not care if you feel them since you can see it working.  But in fact, you can ALSO feel them if you are super silent.  More silence than needed just to stretch one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I treated it even more real!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By just casually assuming real &amp;quot;mini clowns&amp;quot; could get into it and drive away.  And I could count them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I shifted horizontally even further just by accepting it as real and thinking about it BEYOND, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s soooo cool!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to think about how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought of it as &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; by my willingness to fantasize about trying to stuff clowns in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shifted further right, and shape shifted to just 1.5 feet tall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately got into the little car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there were no clowns around.  Clowns are evil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big mistake to climb in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s entry to dreaming.  That&amp;#39;s literally &amp;quot;passing through the wall of fog&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lost my rationality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My link to the memory used in our normal life did not join me, so I drove off into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Woke up the next morning with virtually no memory of that at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stalking is the driving force here.  It was stalking, to pretend a puff can be real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was even better stalking to pretend, you can form a puff into a real object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then stalking supreme, to get into it and drive away!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT&amp;#39;S stalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pranking other people is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We miss the nature of the stalking events in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We fail to see that when Carlos first met some of the lineage&amp;#39;s people and they pretended to be shoppers he just bumped into on the street, spilling their packages, they were pretending to be that so well he couldn&amp;#39;t tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They literally &amp;quot;took it as real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They taught him how to move his assemblage point sideways.  The way sorcerers do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, you MUST do that when your assemblage point is so far along on the J curve, that reality is unstable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all the readers saw was,  they got to make fun of Carlos for being inferior to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;in on their secrets&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Castaneda community went straight for the book deal. For attention seeking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For sitting on a little &amp;quot;Zen Master&amp;quot; throne, to lord it over the sad monks while barely tolerating their ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very ugly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, climbing into clown cars is the truth of stalking.  You might even get a little red nose, so that you don&amp;#39;t think to get a fat head over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making something that is clearly not there, and not real, become real by treating it as such.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not just as make believe, so you can use that story later to impress your friends at how cleverly you work with sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s so much more to this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you see that isn&amp;#39;t there becomes real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, how you feel about it becomes real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;next level of stalking&amp;quot; in darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All attained, using Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s really, the stalking hidden in tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t believe me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go watch Jadey form her &amp;quot;energy body knees&amp;quot;, in the Affection for the energy body pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She forms a head too, as if you can mold puffs and they stay in place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She literally sculpts herself, and then gives it a big hug at the end as if it were now real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And possibly Little Smoke the entity approves, since she knows we&amp;#39;re trying to save the teachings, and gives us a demo of  the gurgling teapot that Carlos also showed us in private classes.  Right in that video.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Analyze that.  There&amp;#39;s at least 2 levels of stalking there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s more!  The levels of stalking never end in darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to list them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a lecture on it just a while ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 Treat it as real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 Use it as real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 Expect it&amp;#39;s context all around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(that engages the will)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 Accept what it now is, with no trace of doubt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(it&amp;#39;s your new reality so don&amp;#39;t reject the emerging Nagual, or the abstract).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 Accept that there are others there with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(don&amp;#39;t pee your pants when the double shows up or you find yourself with the inorganic beings, in their world).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People say, the books don&amp;#39;t have much on stalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;True.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s in the tensegrity!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AND, in Amy&amp;#39;s book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t expect me to read that monstrosity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll go find that Yoda picture...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which illustrates how to motivate women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inspire them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that Yoda inspires the women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just my obsession because of Cholita&amp;#39;s weird connection to Carlos selling imported art and Soledad using money to influence Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null,

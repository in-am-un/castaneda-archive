The last thing you want at 72, is more women.\n\nThey're nice in theory, but in practice not so much.\n\nI suspect it's largely the women causing that situation, plus sorcery knowledge of how women relate to a lineage, that we aren't privy to.\n\nAnd if that offends any of the women, I didn't mean you.\n\nI meant the other women.

There's 500 fake teachers out there, many on Facebook.\n\nThat's the condition we've had for a very long time.\n\nBut as we try to introduce the real thing back some are going to copy it, and try to add it to what they are using to cheat people out of money.\n\nDilution is inevitable.\n\nMy thinking was, people aren't so stupid as not to recognize when it's working, and when it's not.\n\nAnd so if someone steals, there will be pressure on them to make it actually produce the effects we have in here.\n\nThey can go out and steal our meatloaf recipe and add it to the menu, but sooner or later they'll be forced to eat some too.\n\nThey might even get to like it.\n\nBut then I ran into some troublesome women in private chat.\n\nI'm thinking now, women have very complicated motivations.\n\nIt's probably why Carlos explained to Cholita that he'd require intimacy of her one way or the other.\n\nThen he gave her to me.\n\nI think that's what sorcerers do about women.\n\nThey cut to the heart of the matter, and try to get them to focus more single mindedly.\n\nIn our case, there will be women out there teaching other women. For cash.\n\nWith nothing real to teach, other than whatever witchcraft comes naturally to women.\n\nSome will mix in our stuff.\n\nBut they won't be purists about it.\n\nAnd even if it works because they're hard working, no one in the group is going to insist that's the only thing that works.\n\nIt will hurt the feelings of some of the women in the group who do other things, and don't work hard enough to make darkroom function. They'll want someone to kiss their ring too, even if it's not a very good ring.\n\nThe female leaders of small groups will do what female children do, when one of the girls is unhappy while playing a game.\n\nChange the rules.\n\nBoys don't change the rules. They want a winner, and a loser.\n\nThat's the whole point.  Someone needs to cry.\n\nBut women don't like having anyone lose.  Except maybe an enemy.\n\nAll of the women will have complex ties to other things, like maybe the handsome (but stupid as a rock) shaman guy \"Agustin Shaman\".\n\nYes, there really is an Agustin \"Shaman\" out there, who wears a red headband to make himself look Indian.\n\nA total fraud.\n\nBut, he's got female followers.\n\nWith Hanky Panky going on.\n\nYou just can't break up that sort of thing up.\n\nAnd you can't reason with the women.

Sometimes things like money and sex are the end goals, but it still feels a lot of the time even that is power over others. I think a lot of the people who\u2019ve harassed me in public didn\u2019t even know what they wanted in the end, but I had no idea when they would decide that and if what they decided was going to put me in more danger.

I never needed to be convinced because they rang louder than anything I'd ever heard before.\n\nI think a lot of women have this gift, to hear the truth. Women hide this gift from men because a man who thinks that a woman can \"see through\" him is a dangerous man to her. He'll try to undermine her, gaslight her, tell everyone she's crazy. Honestly I think this is where the whole, \"women are crazy\" thing comes from - men trying to undermine women's knowledge in order to secure their own power position. Discredit your possible detractors before they can tell the truth about you. Classic power move. \n\nAnd yes, women ARE crazy because we are not as taken in by rationality as men are. We know the world is a weird weird place. And men are dangerous, violent creatures. Women spend a lot of time placating men so that they won't hurt us, or so they'll protect us if another man tries to hurt us. \n\nWhy am I mentioning all this? Because you'll never be able to relate to women, or what works for them, if you don't understand that women have motivations that never occur to men. Women live with male violence. Many women will do absolutely anything to stay protected - such as aligning themselves with a man who pretends/seems to know all the answers. \n\nSo, women are creatures looking for security (yes, this is a generalization! sorry). The sorcerer's way is a path that doesn't offer much security. It asks us to take away our romantic interests (our male protectors), and stand on our own. A woman on her own is outside of society's protection. She better have her own money and way to protect herself from family and friends and bosses who all think they have a right to tell her what to do. Not to mention predatory men who see a woman alone as a target. Remember how Josefina used to pretend to be ugly and crazy? She did it to be left alone; otherwise men would see her and follow her and try to interfere in the way men do. \n\nWomen are conditioned their whole lives to accept that romantic endeavors are what makes her a woman. A husband, a lover, children, a home. It is very very hard to accept that one might have to give these up. Back to the Second Ring of Power, the male apprentices would complain about the little sisters being such repellent mannish women. And Carlos in that book was called out by the little sisters as disregarding them and only thinking the male sorcerers were important. Men tend to focus on themselves and their own power and only think about women in terms of sex, children, and homelife. Women are conditioned to regard themselves this way, too. It weakens them. They let a man's voice override their inner truth teller. This scenario plays out even in places like this subreddit because it's unconscious and pervasive. The women will allow male practitioners to silence them, minimize them. \n\nSo if you want to know my honest, deep opinion of what you can do to keep women around, it's this. Understand that, even if you aren't trying to dominate them, our social order gives men a bigger voice than women. So for once in your life, give women a bigger voice. Look for ways to support them. They will say something quietly and if you shoot them down, to them it's like a knock out blow, they won't speak up again. The more you acknowledge that they bring something very valuable indeed, the more they will have the confidence to listen to themselves, and take themselves and their practice seriously. \n\nIf you treat women like groupies or hangers-on, there for the sex appeal, that's how they will treat themselves. Because that's how society taught them to see themselves - valuable only as something pleasing to men. \n\nI think the women on the women's subreddit pack a punch. They are fierce and talented. But I also sense that they don't show their true selves on this sub. Wouldn't you rather have a bunch of strong, fearsome witches around, boosting the energy? \n\nIt will take an imaginative leap for the \"leaders\" of this subreddit to find ways to boost women. Every time I see one of you say something positive (and non-sexual) about women sorcerers it gives me a little more confidence. I appreciate being taken seriously as a person.

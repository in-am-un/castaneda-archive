It's a great book, a masterpiece, but for practical sorcery, what you're really asking is, \"Which books lays out some practices that I can try, right now, and start to see some results?\"\n\nFor me, that answer is easy:  Art of Dreaming\n\nArt of Dreaming isn't a book.  It's an instruction manual.  For me, it was a life-jacket when I was drowning.  I honestly think I may have gone off the deep end without it.  \n\nDreaming is one half of the game.  Stalking is the other.  They are two sides of the coin, though, and ultimately you'll need to understand both.  \n\nSo I'd recommend jumping into AOD, and immediately start trying to set up dreaming and find your hands (or dick) in the dream.  You do that, and you'll be on your way. \n\nAnd what's the best way to set up dreaming?  Inner silence of course.  Shutting off the personal dialogue before sleep.  So there you have it.  Two things to work on right away: inner silence, and the first dreaming gate. \n\nYou also asked if anyone had any practical results or is it all theoretical?  I think you're going to find both types in this sub.  I can sense when someone is talking the talk, but hasn't walked the walk.  That's okay. You have to start somewhere, and perhaps by flooding the tonal with theory, you eventually reach the Nagual.  I was the opposite.  I was having dreams that I couldn't explain, reaching the energy body, thought I was cracking up.  Art of Dreaming changed me.  And that is how I know this is the only cognitive system worth pursuing: because I have personally verified too much of it to deny.  \n\nYou'll need to do that too.\n\nHere are some of the practical applications from the books, that I use still:\n\n1) The secret of the twin positions.   This 'secret' was a game-changer, in which you lay down inside a dream and fall asleep again, in order to advance to a new world that is like 10 times more 'locked in' and real.\n\n2) Wrestling/Traveling with an IOB - I had met hyper-real characters in my dreams before, just thought they were aspects of my own personality/subconscious.  Never realized I could grab on and travel with these beings.\n\n3)  Learning that recapitulating my life would free up energy to use in dreaming.  It truly does.  It's unreal.  Of course you can use that free energy for other things too. \n\n4) Learning that inner silence is not only important to reach the 1st gate, but also, inner silence INSIDE your dreaming, is key to holding the dream and not dissolving it.  That is why you are told not to stare at any object too long, because your dialogue will start.  Flitting your gaze from object to object keeps you more silent, and more 'in the dream'.  Heck, you can do it right now.  Look up from your computer screen, and look around from object to object in your house.  That's very similar to doing it in a dream.  If you focus just a few seconds on each object, and then move on to another, you'll find it hard to keep inner dialogue going.  (You'll also find how hard it is to maintain this 'looking about', and how much energy it requires to keep refocusing on new objects). \n\n5)  The importance of places/spots, finding 'your spot', etc, in terms of the effect on your overall energy.\n\n6)  Walking without anything in your hands, with eyes loosely focused on the horizon, and how this helps reach inner silence. \n\nI mean, I could go on, but I want to address the last part of your post: is it different from other \"Asian\" systems?\n\nIt's not even close. You're talking about the single most comprehensive cognitive system for doing real magic that exists on the planet.  Along with that, it's a path with heart.  As you can see, I talk a lot from the dreaming side of things.  But I barely touched stalking, which shows you how to live a trim orderly life, how to store energy,  how to be light, how to erase self importance, how to not take things too seriously (Don Juan and Don Genaro were always laughing, always...)   Do other systems have some aspects of these?  Sure.  Some aspects.  But not all.  And usually some ridiculous God attached in some way. They are belief systems.  This isn't.  This is what is.  It's a guide to working with the governing force of the universe: intent. \n\nAs far as how to proceed... you're right, there is A LOT here, but don't worry too much.  If all this is meant for you, the next step for you personally will reveal itself as you reduce your self-importance, and increase your silence.

And that&amp;#39;s why the Castaneda community is full of such self-proclaimed drug experts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, because of that, there&amp;#39;s another sort of people who prefer that the first few books wouldn&amp;#39;t exist at all. They just love Don Juan&amp;#39;s logical sounding explanations because of the possibility of making a huge inventory out of it. But in the end, it just leads to nothing more than mental masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only very few people realize that even the first books are already full of IOB encounters. And that&amp;#39;s the highest value for a beginner in sorcery. No drugs. No masturbation. But IOBs!

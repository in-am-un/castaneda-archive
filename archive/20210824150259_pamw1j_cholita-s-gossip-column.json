Anything less is \\\\\"boring\\\\\".](https://preview.redd.it/un5kxxjwgbj71.png?width=915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a615d84f0b7c32383d59c3ce353381dfb1c34c3e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCholita is a nomad. A survivor.  A keen observer of people, but from a woman's point of view.\n\nAt 18 she hopped on the back of a motor cycle and announced to her pure blood Spanish mother, and her pure blood Olmec father that she was out of there,  and left her childhood home to go partying with a musician, including a continuous music/sex/drugs trip to Costa Rica to ride the antique wooden train into the mountains.\n\nWhile with that man she helped restore an old building next to an Island, traveled to the Island, found  two handsome European men claiming to be stranded there, and rescued them just in time to throw a party outside that old building they were restoring.\n\nCholita recounted how they had to dodge rocks thrown by the local Indian population,  who didn't see the benefit of having their buildings \"restored\".   One was a sacred place, being so because of a mix of Catholicism, and older Indian superstitions.  Cholita obviously looked down on the village rock throwers as ignorant.  At one point, she had to dodge glass falling from a window they broke, during the process of restoring that side of the building.\n\nI had to interrupt Cholita's memories at one point yesterday, to ask about the Olmec thing.  Cholita was waiting impatiently for her French toast, which she'd ordered after seeing a plate full go by on the way to another restaurant goer in Los Angeles.  She already had ordered too much food, but I must admit the plate of French toast looked good.  If not poisonous to me personally.\n\nAn obviously very old crow crept up the sidewalk towards Cholita, figuring he might get a bite of the croissant she already had on our table.  His head was bent down, as if in submission to Cholita.\n\nCholita fondly recalls her pure Olmec father's amazing blue car with white leather seats, the whole family stuffed into it on road trips all across Mexico.   As Cholita thought about it, she had to point out that her father wasn't much of a driver, so her brothers had take care of that task.\n\nCholita's father worked for the government designing bridges and such. There was some kind of tension in the family, but nothing abnormal for a Mexican family with 9 or 10 children.\n\nI interrupted Cholita's recounting when I heard that last part about her father not driving well.  Being an \"ugly American\", I figured it was his pure Indian blood that made him bad with driving. I pictured him traveling by teleportation instead, making use of the technology developed 10,000 years ago by his ancestors.  Despite having invented the wheel, their form of travel was probably more fun.\n\nWhen you're with Cholita, anything seems possible.\n\n\"Who told you that your father was pure Olmec?\", I asked Cholita.  I had researched the topic and discovered that if you look up Indian populations still considered intact in Mexico, the Olmecs will not be on the list.\n\nI figured, Carlos told her that.  It was part of his usual technique of trying to tie women in the group to things from the past of sorcerers.  To give them more connections to *intent*.\n\nCholita had a blank look on her face, as if the question were either non-sensical, or it was a forbidden topic.\n\n\"I was supposed to help XXXXX and her friend YYYYY.\", Cholita informed me.\n\nIt was the first I'd heard of that.  For the women in the inner circle and in private classes, there were some common rituals.  Gifts of clothing to new women was one, intended to create a link between the woman giving the clothes, and  the woman receiving them.\n\nTo improperly accept the clothes gift could be a fatal mistake.\n\nBut so far, I had only peripherally heard about pairing women off, as little units.\n\nI recalled that group of 3 women.  One was from Argentina, the other probably from El Salvador.  I don't know their origins for sure,  because Cholita couldn't recall well. It's been so long.\n\nThe 3 of them had shown up in front of me, after private class at Dance Home, when it was already well known Carlos was dying and attempts were being made to \"hold the group together\".   Those attempts seemed to include an offer for me to become Florinda's lover, presumably causing me to go with Kylie when they left. I was too socially clueless to realize that, and after turning it down Cholita showed up with her 2 \"charges\", and announced I could select one of them to marry.\n\nCarlos had made me celibate, and although I found all 3 women attractive I picked Cholita because she was aggressive, the other 2 were afraid to speak, and I knew if I so much as put my hand on Cholita's knee, her fist would start lashing out.  She made the safest \"wife\".\n\nI was disappointed to hear, I was Cholita's last choice.  Paul, a tall blond German man who spoke English with just a hint of a German accent,  and was still sensitive about that \"World War 2 incident\" where they tried to kill all Jews,  was her first.  But Paul was first choice among all the women in private classes, except perhaps for Miles, who was already married, and the 2 Canadian brothers.\n\nI believe it was Carlos' doctor sneaking around behind the scenes trying to marry one of the Canadian brothers, while pretending she was interested in the other, that drove the eventual marriage proposals.\n\nCarlos had commented, \"We're under attack!\", when he found out about the intended marriage of his doctor.\n\nBut as he got closer to dying he must have decided holding the group together was more important than trying to keep people from chasing the usual self-pity motivated social \"prizes\".  Like having a \"love of your life\".\n\nHe was aware of the marriage attempts, and also aware of who I ended up with.  I had asked Cholita if Carlos knew about this, before I agreed to marry her.  \"Of course!\", she mumbled.  She looked at the other 2 women for backup and they nodded yes, nervously.\n\n\"You're so shallow Cholita!\",  I told her.  \"Every woman wants Paul.  As a result, he's practically a gigalo!\n\nCholita giggled and suggested the wife he'd just dumped was not happy when he heard Cholita had proposed marriage to him.\n\nI wanted to return to the shallow topic.  Cholita had accused me of wearing nothing but jeans covered in crap, causing me to toss out all of my pants to get \"clean\" ones so Cholita would not complain anymore.  I have to cook all of my own food due to food allergies, and had a bad habit of wiping my hands on the side and back after washing them in the sink.  Not enough to leave any obvious food, but if you do that for months you end up with permanent, slightly brown stains.\n\nI tried to return to the topic of how Cholita was only attracted to well dressed tall men with blue eyes, when she finished her list of men she'd approached to marry, before me.\n\nThey got shorter and worse dressed the further down the list she went.  Finally, she reported she'd asked Larry before me.  An older man with red hair, not exactly known for being stylish or hunted by the women.\n\nLarry managed to change the topic,  amidst nervous laughter, when approached by Cholita.\n\nI asked about the other 2 women, and if they had found husbands.\n\nCholita commented, \"I really did help those women!\", a little surprised herself when she recalled it.\n\nThat got me curious.  Cholita's primary teacher had been Florinda, since Cholita is a powerful dreamer.  I wanted to know the details of the \"help\".\n\nCholita answered, \"When I was thrown out...\"\n\nI stopped her.  \"You were thrown out of private classes???\", I asked.\n\n\"No...\", Cholita said.  \"When the Nagual said he was dead, it was over.  We all stuck around longer.  None to learn sorcery.  Just \"hanging out\". Some needed a new place to live.  Some wanted a husband.  Many were trying to make money from their time in the group.\"\n\nShe mentioned turning down the idea of working for cleargreen.\n\nI tried to recall who had wanted to cash in, but the list got too long and I had to admit, the  private class people were as near to hopeless and motivated only by greed, as you could get.\n\nIt's no different in the rest of the Castaneda community.  No one wants to learn magic.  That's too much work.  And if you try to remind them about that, even showing them it's easy to do if you find the time, you get attacked.\n\nAs long as they can pretend, form friendships, and hopefully earn some money and ultimately become famous,  their wants are satisfied.\n\nI told Cholita we'd found some lecture notes from 1997 where Florinda said such people are hopeless. They can't be fixed, once they've drunk from that tea brew of using Tensegrity to enhance your own ego.\n\nCholita asked, \"And do you know where Florinda is?\"\n\nI told her, as far as I know, no one does.  And no one has actually seen her.  They announced in 2002 that the witches would take over as the new workshop leaders, but then they never showed up.  And in my opinion, they were somewhere south of Fontana.\n\nBut I'd only seen them there in the second attention, which is notoriously hard to interpret.  I wouldn't have even paid attention to that, except that I was fully awake when I found myself sitting on a couch, next to them.\n\nCholita commented,  about the second attention, \"You go to live in there and your body dies!  Withers away into a corpse.  A mummy.  Dries up.  Empty eye ball sockets.\"\n\nLater, the conversation drifted to Cholita's missing car.\n\nIt had been gone a week.\n\nI figured it was lost somewhere in Los Angeles.\n\nCholita laughed and commented, \"You didn't know where it was???\"\n\nI pointed out, how could I?  She wouldn't tell me.\n\nCholita looked disappointed, as if I ought to be able to figure things like that out, with no help.\n\nShe asked me, \"Are you the new Nagual?\"\n\nI told her, \"Of course not! The only Nagual Carlos found was Tony Lama.\"\n\nCholita became excited.  The inner circle women had a thing for Tony.\n\nCholita started to explain it.  \"After he took  that picture of a voladores over the pyramid of the serpent, we...\"\n\nThe old crow approached a piece of bread I'd torn off and tossed onto the sidewalk earlier.  He had to wait for  a young couple dressed entirely in black, with a silent baby in a baby carriage, walking past the restaurant.\n\nWe both got distracted.\n\n\"I'll take you to the car, but it's not in Los Angeles.\"\n\nLater I found out the car was at the highest hill Cholita could find, a fully developed low mountain expensive home neighborhood, south of our house.  Cholita had taken it there to flee \"the radiation\", and had been sleeping in it at night.  I presume she slept there several nights, before she discovered it would no longer start.\n\nI promised to find her a faraday cage blanket made of silver in the morning, if we could bring her car home.\n\nI left Cholita at the library in LA, her hands shaking so much she had a hard time typing text messages on her phone.  She attributed it to lack of sleep, because of the radiation.\n\nAs I walked away from her, I found myself so dizzy I almost stumbled and fell.\n\nI spent the rest of the night shifted so far to the right, that I became a round membrane filled with liquid, which had a hole at the bottom needing to receive a plug like device, to make each of 5 tubes dissolve.\n\nI was fully awake, watching the scene as I lay on the bed.\n\nI realized my assemblage point had shifted too far to the right, due to Cholita's abundant dark energy, which was so strong that day that it made me high just riding in the car with her.  But I also picked up her illness.\n\nI've been wanting to understand far right shifts, and the inevitable shapeshifting they produce.  I tried to figure out how far down I had shifted, to have that complete of a transformation.\n\n\"You're still at the top\", someone informed me.\n\n\"Too bad\", I thought to myself, as I noticed I was down to just 3 lines left to dissolve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cholita's Gossip Column", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Cholita"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 95, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"un5kxxjwgbj71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 74, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/un5kxxjwgbj71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29358b17947829a24967b1b125449b64ee6f80f1"}, {"y": 148, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/un5kxxjwgbj71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a25ae06f60395685976c8581eb2fcac53ed12a09"}, {"y": 219, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/un5kxxjwgbj71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31be3da30945c791048c5edfbcc55cb9bf549c3e"}, {"y": 438, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/un5kxxjwgbj71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d34957f30f15de9e060189deae7ae17fdc68408d"}], "s": {"y": 627, "x": 915, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/un5kxxjwgbj71.png?width=915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a615d84f0b7c32383d59c3ce353381dfb1c34c3e"}, "id": "un5kxxjwgbj71"}}, "name": "t3_pamw1j", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Cholita", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/DtPCK3BjeOZnpiK_gK3cmh2Vdqe6CZf32tGAh2mXlTY.jpg", "edited": 1629819745.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1629810179.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/un5kxxjwgbj71.png?width=915&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a615d84f0b7c32383d59c3ce353381dfb1c34c3e\"&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s idea of beauty.

She wouldn&amp;#39;t tell me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita looked disappointed, as if I ought to be able to figure things like that out, with no help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She asked me, &amp;quot;Are you the new Nagual?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her, &amp;quot;Of course not! The only Nagual Carlos found was Tony Lama.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita became excited.  The inner circle women had a thing for Tony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita started to explain it.  &amp;quot;After he took  that picture of a voladores over the pyramid of the serpent, we...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old crow approached a piece of bread I&amp;#39;d torn off and tossed onto the sidewalk earlier.  He had to wait for  a young couple dressed entirely in black, with a silent baby in a baby carriage, walking past the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We both got distracted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll take you to the car, but it&amp;#39;s not in Los Angeles.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later I found out the car was at the highest hill Cholita could find, a fully developed low mountain expensive home neighborhood, south of our house.  Cholita had taken it there to flee &amp;quot;the radiation&amp;quot;, and had been sleeping in it at night.  I presume she slept there several nights, before she discovered it would no longer start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I promised to find her a faraday cage blanket made of silver in the morning, if we could bring her car home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left Cholita at the library in LA, her hands shaking so much she had a hard time typing text messages on her phone.  She attributed it to lack of sleep, because of the radiation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I walked away from her, I found myself so dizzy I almost stumbled and fell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the night shifted so far to the right, that I became a round membrane filled with liquid, which had a hole at the bottom needing to receive a plug like device, to make each of 5 tubes dissolve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was fully awake, watching the scene as I lay on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized my assemblage point had shifted too far to the right, due to Cholita&amp;#39;s abundant dark energy, which was so strong that day that it made me high just riding in the car with her.  But I also picked up her illness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to understand far right shifts, and the inevitable shapeshifting they produce.  I tried to figure out how far down I had shifted, to have that complete of a transformation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re still at the top&amp;quot;, someone informed me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Too bad&amp;quot;, I thought to myself, as I noticed I was down to just 3 lines left to dissolve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "43d4e582-6010-11ea-a748-0ef2a7bb995d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "pamw1j", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 16, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pamw1j/cholitas_gossip_column/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/pamw1j/cholitas_gossip_column/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1629810179.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hab0jj5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ha8k4o5", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Sure.

She also made an important distinction between moving the assemblage point and moving the &amp;#39;beam&amp;#39; of attention that comes from the assemblage point and fixates on a particular area or spot within the fringe of awareness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, keep in mind that in the orange zone, you are already away from &amp;quot;me&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you still focus your awareness using your learned sense of what&amp;#39;s real and what&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means, there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;something else&amp;quot; besides the silence, and the position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;generated thing&amp;quot;.   A thing produced by expectations over your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t look for it in the darkroom, but when you start to notice that in the absence of the assemblage point, there are still &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; left that block visions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;seeing energy&amp;quot;.

I can see why the monasteries frowned on it in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in sorcery, you MUST have women around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They supply the energy for the men, just by being part of the group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos always used a woman to introduce a new topic to his private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_pamw1j", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pamw1j/cholitas_gossip_column/ha817wv/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1629845856.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ha7q6ke", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "bluemoon1967", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1629841042.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_pamw1j", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_243jum6e", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "A \u201ccontinuous music, sex, drugs trip to Costa Rica\u201d........perfect.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ha7q6ke", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A \u201ccontinuous music, sex, drugs trip to Costa Rica\u201d........perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pamw1j/cholitas_gossip_column/ha7q6ke/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1629841042.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_pamw1j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

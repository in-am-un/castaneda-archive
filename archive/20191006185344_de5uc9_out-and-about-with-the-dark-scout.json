But I liked the picture so much that I've posted that before the story is finished.\n\nI do in fact have cellphone video of the entire event, including the beer drinking contest.  Cholita had hidden a skimpy little camouflage theme top under her jacket, and brought out her belly button just before going on stage.\n\nBut Cholita's been trying to teach me about boundaries.   I'm autistic; those are sketchy.\n\nSo I'll just take her advice, and keep that video to myself.\n\nIf the picture makes you wonder, then yes.  I wanted to brush the  \"Kind Bar\" crumbs off her leg.  They were spoiling the view.\n\nCholita likes candy.   But for a 3 month period in private classes, Carlos took us off all stimulants, including sugar and fruit.\n\nSo candy now has to be blessed by Whole Foods or Cholita won't touch it.\n\nKind Bars are perfect.\n\nAs far as helping her keep her leggings tidy, I'm out of luck. Cholita jumps a mile if we accidentally touch.  Although, right about then in the trip, she did comment about the situation in a disturbingly relevant way.\n\nShe said, \"He grabbed her crotch???\"\n\nIf you've been \"poked\" recently, came here, and wonder what the hell is going on, Cholita is completely mad.   She's a left-over pampered student from Carlos Castaneda's private classes, one he specifically secured and put into my charge.\n\nDon't try to ascribe any normal behavior to her, or you'll be making a mistake far too often.\n\nAt times she seems rational, but when you figure out what she's really thinking it's often nothing like what you guessed.\n\nYou almost have to sink into her dreaming to keep track.  Cholita is a westerly dreamer, who's gone mad. Like Zuleica.  Or if that's too obscure, Josefina.\n\nI've been trying to fully follow her dreaming awake, and at times I can remember bits of conversations.\n\nBut Cholita figures it out, and blocks me.\n\nIn this case, somehow I knew crotches were a reference to Trump.   Next came  a rant which included \"Stormy Daniels\", and me pointing out, \"Yea, but he's a billionaire!\".\n\nCholita finally concluded that in these modern times, with women's lib and such, it was OK for Trump to grab crotches.\n\nThey could just grab back if they didn't like it.\n\nSorry... I got lost in the details of the trip.  Most of the time I'm laughing almost uncontrollably, when I'm with Cholita.  She's just so amusing.  If I don't remember, remind me to give chapter 2 on Cholita's advice for \"How to deal with servants.\"\n\nMy jaw almost dropped.  I haven't been that frazzled since the first time I stepped into Soi Cowboy 2, in Bangkok.\n\nBut as for Cholita's behavior, I can only say, finally!!!  Someone to whom I don't sound completely delusional.  Thank you Carlos!\n\nIn this story you will learn that Carlos not only kidnapped and manipulated Cholita in a ruthless and cunning manner, adding a  heavy dose of patience and a sprinkling of sweetness, not dissimilar to my somewhat more benign behavior with Jenna (who will be my girl forever), but that he also placed a  \"you have mail\" button on Cholita.\n\nI had only to figure out how push it for a personal message directly from him.\n\nGoosebumps for sure!\n\nIf you're still stuck up in the old thinking on sorcery, goosebumps indicates a sudden and drastic movement of the assemblage point, releasing energy because it's a position you haven't been to, or haven't used in a long time.\n\nThere's nothing complicated or unfathomable about the assemblage point.   We're all intimately familiar with how it feels, when it moves.  \n\nAnd so, sorry Dr. Whale. You're clueless.  Stop taking advantage of people. You'll never learn that way.\n\n(An obscure reference to a publication I made, 25 years ago).\n\nAfter I pressed the \"you have mail\" button in Cholita, and received it, the message self destructed.\n\nCholita had no memory of it just one day after delivering it.  I just wanted her to clarify one word.  My own self interests blinded me to it, and I just wanted to make sure.\n\nNope.  Message erased.  Another \"blank check\" from Carlos.  That was the second one I received.\n\nLet me tantalize you about the message.  Did you see one of  those superman movies,  where young superman who hasn't a clue what's going on finds a crystal database, activates it to get answers from the computer, an artificial being materializes and then says, \"Oh... I hoped it would be you!\".\n\nThat's what Carlos did.\n\nAnd you'll also start to wonder if Cholita isn't actually punking me,  being a much more powerful sorceress than I had thought.  And that, dare I say it, her madness is closer to  a choice than happenstance.\n\nI'll continue the story as replies, unless someone writes me that there's a better way to organize 3 part stories.\n\nEdited: nine times because I keep looking at the picture and remembering more details.  I'll really try to cut that out now.\n\nNote: Has anyone figured out that I'm still attacking the \"warrior's way\"?  Cholita chastised me for that.\n\nNow I'm proposing more fun, less seriousness.  Be impeccable about having fun.\n\nAnd go ahead and take Cholita's advice too.  Impeccability is everything.  All your choices will be correct, when you attain it.\n\nEven the ones that aren't.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Out and About with the Dark Scout", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Cholita"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"pe0pggtpayq31": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 150, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/pe0pggtpayq31.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14439b84a595c268e9f437eb4ed255154ec7b4d9"}, {"y": 301, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/pe0pggtpayq31.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc90ddec992f2a0eaa777e3e3e6a5f0300712820"}, {"y": 447, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/pe0pggtpayq31.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=977628f0aaa7a879dd8a5b73157e9f23ffb1d63d"}], "s": {"y": 693, "x": 496, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/pe0pggtpayq31.jpg?width=496&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9364dff4b817c1759dc1f8456962a5092278d0c7"}, "id": "pe0pggtpayq31"}}, "name": "t3_de5uc9", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Cholita", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/oRFDvymSRjlSRYMsgwKzm0nw6NJYod5IVOO0675Mmiw.jpg", "edited": 1570394067.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1570380824.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pe0pggtpayq31.jpg?width=496&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9364dff4b817c1759dc1f8456962a5092278d0c7\"&gt;Cholita Relaxes on the Way to Infinity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a story about a 24 hour scouting mission which Cholita embarked on, dragging me along almost against my will.

They could in fact see in the dark.\n\nAnother item from the books that I've verified since I got my hands on Cholita's delicious dark energy is that the back of my neck pops when my second attention is coming out.\n\nJust like don Juan told Carlos.\n\nWhen I first read that, my second attention could already come out. So I was a bit in doubt about what the clicking or popping (I don't recall the exact words) could be.\n\nIt was a tiny bit more doubt about Carlos' account. How much is made up, how much is a literal accounting?\n\nDuring meditation I'd encountered it. When the body relaxes due to bliss, sometimes the back of the skull realigns to whatever neck bone it rests on, and that produces the click.\n\nBut as for the second attention coming out, that's not what it feels like in meditation. It feels like the click is a side effect of becoming very relaxed.\n\nAnd I'm sure that's what happens in sorcery also, except that if you are silent, you're already in that deep meditative state. So you're already relaxed.\n\nThis clicking or popping seems to be associated with a mini-black out.  The popping jars you out of the blackout, and you start to look around. \n\nAnd so after that click, you can feel the assemblage point moving so fast that you get a tingle, and your dreaming attention brightens up \"the room\", whatever that turns out to be in the darkness.\n\nSo mark 2 more specific points from Carlos' books as being verified. Outlandish ones to boot.\n\nAnd put down, as partially verified, that tingle he tried to get on the top of his head while driving under a low hanging concrete beam in an LA garage.\n\nI haven't gotten it that way, but I get it from my feet to my head often now, as a result of Cholita's Nagual coming out to play.  She seems to love to torture me with it.\n\nShe played a game of \"hot\" and cold in the car, giggling when I tried to use my hand to figure out how she was doing it.  Twice!  I had to stop, for all her weird laughter and mock screaming.\n\nCholita's punking me!\n\nAnd I can also report, that shared dreaming is starting to look like an easy thing to do, once you can get silent, see energy, and assemble other worlds. \n\nI didn't know about that for the last few years, because I didn't have a Cholita to experiment on. \n\nAn ordinary person wouldn't do. You need someone with strong dreaming attention, like Cholita.  I guess the intent they radiate is stronger than normal.\n\nCholita's dreams literally flow into the room as a purple patchy fog.  I can rotate in the darkness and even figure out which direction she's radiating from.\n\nAll I have to do to understand what she's perceiving is to get very silent, and wait for the fog to make better shapes.\n\nLike some famous \"square\" she visited in Seattle.  A park of sorts, possibly associated with where she landed via train.  I'd have better info, but Cholita will only tell a story once. Asking for details is useless.\n\nAnd yet, I've seen that park through her dreaming.  \n\nCholita got angry when I asked about it in very specific terms (told her I saw it in dreaming), and she made me promise not to follow her.\n\nSo I don't anymore. Or won't, until she mellows out and re-instates permission.\n\nEven so, the next night she appeared on that fog.  I was staring at a piece, wishing it would get brighter so I could find an entity to play with.\n\nBut there was Cholita's head, at the age where Carlos put us together.\n\nHer bangs were exceptionally dark, since she was a young woman.\n\nMy first thought was, \"My Fairy is Back!\"  \n\nAnd she's doing Cholita imitations.  \n\nBut this image was smoother, and seemed to animate completely.  My little fairy only animates once a second, or less.  She\u2019s just a series of still frames which morph as you stare at her.\n\nThis one gave me a fierce glance,  the kind only Cholita can deliver.  \n\nYou don't want to get that glance, I promise you.\n\nUnless it comes with a smile.  And then, it's irresistible.  \n\nHer dreaming head (with maybe a touch of shoulders) started to walk off.  At first she was just that head, but on walking she organized the purple fog into something real, as if it were parting from the wind generated by her steps, and that rippled down at a diagonal in her path.  In less than a second I could see her entire body, and where she was walking.\n\nShe escaped.  And I was banned from following due to a promise.\n\nLater I found her in Mexico, which I ended up smashing to pieces.  Maybe I wasn't allowed to follow, but she didn't make me promise not to break off a chunk of Mexico and hold her in my hands.\n\nI'm too busy with Cholita today to finish those stories, but that was a highlight. I suspect more people are interested in what you can do, rather than what happened in Carlos' world, before he died.\n\nI'm more interested in what Carlos was up to back then, than I am in verifying more techniques.\n\nI'd now say that if anything, Carlos downplayed the weirdness and magic of sorcery, possibly because he'd experienced the same problems I do, when I first tell people who write to me about my little Fairy entity.\n\nAnd you can see that excessive weirdness in his last books, where he seems to flow smoothly from one location to the other, never having a problem catching up with don Juan.\n\nEdited: twice", "edited": 1570563221.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f2x91hc", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You thought about a book deal, and it went away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About the lines on your palm.

On the second day of this roughly 24 hour scouting mission, Cholita did her usual thing and made such a fuss in a restaurant, that we ended up with 3 people attending to us, including the manager.\n\nShe seems to have found a loophole in the restaurant industry. Unless it\u2019s \u201cDel Taco\u201d, you don\u2019t get thrown out for being rude or demanding. Instead, they give up and do what you want, to keep the peace in the restaurant.\n\nIt\u2019s probably not good for business to see a woman dressed in expensive clothes, being thrown out with physical force, cursing all the way.\n\nAnd also, if it\u2019s an expensive restaurant, and you have an older man with a crazy younger wife, you might have a potential repeat customer. If his wife makes so much trouble that some restaurants will turn him away, then he might go there more often.\n\nCholita cut the line by 1.5 hours in LA, at Water Grill. That\u2019s a fairly expensive place, with $50 steaks and $20 drinks. And it\u2019s all, \u201cA la carte\u201d.\n\nIt happened because Cholita wasn\u2019t satisfied with the scouting we\u2019d done that day, after emerging from the Tensegrity Dome. She decided that the day was still young, and we were going to wander around Los Angeles for another 5 hours making pictures and videos of everything.\n\nBut first we had to eat. She just picked the first expensive place we passed while wandering along.  \u201cAs long as it isn\u2019t anything cheap!\u201d, she said.\n\nI entered first and arranged for an impromptu table without reservations at the front counter. They told me there was absolutely nothing available for 1.5 hours, but we could sit at the bar and order it all.\n\nWe sat at the bar, then Cholita announced it was \u201ctoo cold\u201d there. She flagged down the wrong waiter, told him it was too cold and we wanted a table.\n\nI explained, it was a 1.5 hour wait, and the waiter said he\u2019d go check. He came back and said, \u201cYes, there\u2019s absolutely nothing available for more than an hour. I\u2019m sorry\u201d.\n\nCholita got up and went off. She stopped me from following. I was worried sick, but she said, \u201cGet some Cojones for God\u2019s Sake!\u201d\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, the manager came and escorted me to Cholita\u2019s table, where she now had 3 servants continuously waiting on her every need. The manager even came by every 15 minutes to make sure everything was satisfactory (that there was no screaming).\n\nCholita returned 2 items during the meal, and they eagerly changed them to match her specifications. One required a skilled Chef to correctly interpret her insistence, \"This isn't bitter enough!!!\"\n\nDarned if he didn't figure out exactly what she was complaining about, and probably mumbling to himself under his breath, \"Peasants!\", did what she wanted.\n\nRather than being told not to come back, we were told that we were welcome there anytime, and they hope my wife feels better soon.\n\nCholita lives like that. It\u2019s a little hard to get used to.\n\nShe was born in a family with 6 girls, and 2 boys. I commented that it was a lot of children. She replied, \u201cIt was a lot more than that, but\u2026\u201d\n\nI could only guess what the \u201cbut\u201d meant. She didn\u2019t explain. But it does show where Cholita gets her tendency to push things the way she wants. She had to compete with 6 older sisters, and 2 brothers. One brother she loved, who died early, and another she's not too happy with, accusing him of being gay.\n\nGay is not an insult to Cholita. She loves gay men. It just means, her feminine charms don't work on him.\n\nWhen the initial fireworks of getting seated in a restaurant ended, Cholita took back what she\u2019d said the day before.\n\nShe'd said that it was OK to call her by her real name, in my postings. She didn't like my alternative of \"Dark Scout\", or Cholita, and so that was the only thing left.\n\nBut the next day, she had changed her mind. She again explained that she never liked that name, \u201cCholita\u201d.  It\u2019s the diminutive for \u201cChola\u201d, which means a Chicano Woman.\n\nShe said it made her sound like a mini copy of Margarita, who was indeed a Chicano. She taught Chicano studies at one of the local colleges, and according to Cholita, she had money.\n\nShe also enlisted and secured Cholita from out of Mexico, gave her a place to live, and introduced her to Carlos and the inner circle.\n\nBut being a mini-me to a Chola wasn't suitable to Cholita. She explained that the term, \u201cChola\u201d is also a derogatory term in South America. So it\u2019s doubly bad.\n\nShe took out her cell phone. I could see she\u2019d gone scouting again, but on the internet. She brought up several articles defining what a \u201cChola\u201d meant, in various places.\n\nFortunately, I was armed by someone in this group. I could confidently point out, those meanings didn\u2019t apply here. All it meant here was, a stylish Chicano woman (born here, and not in South America) with a gang like attitude. At least, that\u2019s what it meant in the 60s and 70s, which were Carlos\u2019 youthful days.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t derogatory at all.  It was a term of endearment.\n\nCholita pointed out that Chicanos hate Mexicans. I can vouch for that. I used to hear them say, \u201cWe\u2019re not wet backs.\u201d And \u201cThose beaners are nothing like us!\u201d\n\nCholita went on. \u201cAnd Mexicans hate them back. They have NO culture. They\u2019re just a combination of street trash, and the sewer.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t see any point in continuing to convince her, so I asked, which name should I use? You don\u2019t like, \u201cDark Scout\u201d. Do you want me to use your real name, like you said yesterday?\n\nNo, she said quietly. I don\u2019t.\n\nBut to the scout thing. What makes Cholita a scout is the fact that she\u2019s driven to seek out sensory experiences which provide her with \u201cpersonal growth\u201d.\n\nShe put it that way herself. That means, for the last 30 years, she\u2019s been attending one new age weird lecture after another, at least 2 a month. She\u2019s taken courses on how to \u201cthink and grow rich\u201d, how to \u201calign your energy frequency\u201d, weird Kungfu, Chopra workshops, and so on.\n\nAll the embarrassing crap I try to avoid like the plague. Cholita\u2019s swimming in it. She\u2019s even been doing a \u201cscattering energy\u201d technique nearly daily, for 20 years.\n\nThat explains the mess she\u2019s in. Or maybe it relieves the mess she\u2019s in. I\u2019m not sure yet.\n\nAnd she loves to talk about the weird things she studies. When Carlos first put us together, I wished to God she\u2019d stop talking once in a while. It was pleasant talk back then, but non-stop.\n\n\u201cDid you hear about these guys???\u201d, she\u2019d say. She\u2019d hold up some printed material (no cellphones back then), and start to explain the whole thing to me.\n\nNow she does the same with her cellphone, or even worse, she drags me along because she wrecked her car and needs transportation.\n\nEach time, I\u2019m not sorry she did. I\u2019m glad she did, because I actually get out into the world to see what the latest Tonal is like.\n\nSorcerers need to pop their heads up once in a while, and check out the \u201cTonal of Our Times\u201d.\n\nScouts force that.  They don\u2019t necessarily always scout the second attention. Their scouting is a universal behavior, and likely extends to the social.\n\nWith Cholita, both the second attention and the real world are the same thing, so she\u2019s doubly scouty.\n\nBut scouts aren\u2019t saints, and they likely always get into trouble. Emilito sounded like a big grouch to me, when I read about him. No time for anyone else, it\u2019s all about him. If you want to listen and see, then he\u2019s your friend. If you\u2019re any trouble, you\u2019re out of here.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s my impression of Emilito from what\u2019s written of him.\n\nAnd Carlos was swimming in scouts. At the end he was searching for \u201cThe Orange Scout\u201d, whom he never found.\n\nAnd he had \u201cThe blue scout\u201d tagging along for years. She\u2019s the likely reason I\u2019m here.\n\nBut she scouted herself into Death Valley following Carlos\u2019 death, and died from exposure.\n\nI wish she'd stuck around. I would have protected her.\n\nContinued in part 2.\n\nEdited: once", "edited": 1570568375.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f30md4y", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part one: What\u2019s a scout?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll start this story in the middle, because Cholita insisted.

We'd get a better picture.\n\nIt seems to me that some of them even **owe** him for all the special attention they received, and aren't paying their debts these days.\n\nI'd also say that the leaders Carlos set up as his first line of attack on his death,  have been seriously negligent. Since his death they haven't done anything to combat the criticism of Carlos' handling of apprentices.\n\nThey could have set the record straight by just being honest.  His techniques work, so there's nothing to worry about.\n\nLet's hear about those orgies!  Were they entirely lesbian?\n\nAnd was there really naked Infinity Theater?  Did some aspects of sex get inserted into the script?\n\nHow about those baths in rosemary water for new female apprentices?\n\nDid Carlos fondle the women?  What effect did that have on their commitment?  \n\nDid he really want to do that?\n\nI'd say no, but according to Cholita I badly need to get a sex life.\n\nWhat's the energetic connection to intimacy?

I'm fixing things for her today, and only escaped her clutches for an hour.\n\nCholita's last husband was a Hollywood exec. He was also a member of the academy, so Cholita spent a lot of time watching movies with him.\n\nEventually Cholita went mad, he didn't realize that was the problem, and he threw her out for her angry behavior.\n\nCholita's so far gone now that while eating a take-out bowl of soup in the car last night she became angry, showed me the bowl, and pointed out how quickly the soup had gone down.\n\nI asked her if she thought someone was eating it while she held it in her hand and she said, \"Of course. You are!\"\n\nUnlike her husband, I don't find that objectionable. I just try to figure out what's going on. If there\u2019s a way to use Cholita for not-doing, I\u2019ll go for it. If we hadn\u2019t been driving, I would have insisted on searching the car for the soup stealing intruder. Even better, I might have been able to find one.\n\nHer condition is almost surely a lateral shift of the assemblage point, due to some medical issue.\n\nIf you learn to assemble other worlds, you\u2019ll become somewhat familiar with lateral shifts.\n\nThey\u2019ve very disturbing. I believe don Juan called that realm, \u201cdiscarded junk\u201d.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s expected that a westerly witch goes mad, the examples being Josefina and Zuleica.\n\nAnd there's certainly going to be a medical explanation for it, even if it's naive.\n\nThe main thing is, it's inevitable. Sorcery or not.\n\nAnd she still possess the qualities that make a westerly witch so useful. She plunges into the unknown, and can assemble it to make some sort of sense of it, even if it's not all that rational.\n\nI tried to change the conversation to something more useful than a soup thief.\n\nI mentioned that the one and only time I saw her husband, he looked a little gay to me. I even commented to the person who was with me, watching Cholita and her husband from a distance, doesn\u2019t he look a little gay?\n\nYep. They agreed.\n\nCholita got excited. \"Yea, he must have been!!!\", she said.\n\nNeither of us have anything against that. It's just a possible explanation for why he threw Cholita out, which tickles her fancy.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t her, it was him. He was gay, that's why he didn't appreciate her.\n\nThinking of Corey, who probably wouldn't like this conversation at all, I mentioned, maybe it's just the LA style?\n\nSome sort of metro-sexual thing neither of us can understand because we're old fogies.\n\nI pointed out that the last time I went to Century City Mall, half the men seemed to me to be gay. Certainly the French kissing and extended hugging were possible warning signs. And all the hand holding on the escalators didn\u2019t help.\n\nCholita then started to tell me all kinds of things about Carlos. Gossipy stuff she hadn't mentioned before.\n\nI shouted, \"Wait, don't talk so fast!!!\"\n\nIt's always noisy in the car, and very difficult to hear Cholita. She doesn't pay much attention to which direction she's talking, how loudly, or even whether anyone is actually listening.\n\nAnd she always has both windows open, with music blasting.\n\nI leaned in towards her and was able to hear, \"He didn't like pubic hair.\"\n\nThat was a reference to Carlos.\n\nI wanted to ask her, but didn't. A time or two her shorts had slipped a bit far, and it seemed like Cholita might also have gotten the command to shave it of. And perhaps kept it that way, along with the Chacmool hair style.\n\n\"Well, that sounds better to me!\", I said instead. I wanted to offer a little encouragement.\n\nI remembered from Class that there was a controversy going around as to whether all the women were being pressured to shave their pubic hair. The best source of such rumors was Pat, whom I surely wish would notice this forum and come reminisce with us. The last time I told her what I'd learned to do with Carlos' techniques, I suspect she figured I'd gone crazy.\n\nAt one point in private classes, I heard that Carlos would even have the women shave spiral patterns down there.\n\nRather than being shocked, I wondered if I might be allowed to see an example.\n\nAnd of course there was the Sorcerer's Cave on Malibu road, where he told the women to go and expose themselves to Malibu Beach.\n\nI took a few up there myself. The cave is on a sheer and very high rock cliff, which you've already seen if you've watched a bunch of old movies. Cars often plunge to their doom off that cliff, when Hollywood doesn't want to have to travel far to find a dangerous road.\n\nI can't walk within 6 feet of the cliff edge before my body freezes on the spot and my legs won't move. But to get to the cave, you even have to make a leap of faith across a tiny tilted ledge, and into what looks like a carved out area with a couch made from the same rock.\n\nMy guess, someone used that to hold cameras for a movie, and carved it just for that event.\n\nBut the rumor is that la Gorda sat in that cave.\n\nFor newbies, don't judge Carlos based on his sexual antics. I\u2019m celibate because of Carlos, and hope to remain that way.\n\nBut with Cholita around, I can assure everyone that sorcery and women results in sexual controversies. Hierarchies and loyalties have to be established, or women will mostly linger on the outskirts of commitment.\n\nAs that Russian witch has said, women are all about building their kingdom. And if it's torn down, the way Carlos tended to do with female apprentices, they'll rebuild it from what they have.\n\nThe most practical way to resolve that is to fuck the women. I\u2019m sorry to say that, but there you have it.\n\nWorse, the women don't mind at all. I have yet to find one with a complaint.\n\nCholita continued talking and I managed to hear, \"I myself would have loved to fuck him, but I was never asked.\"\n\nShe went on, \"The Nagual wasn't what you would call a handsome man. But still most of the women wanted to fuck him.\"\n\n\"I just never got the chance\", she said.\n\nI suggested, maybe Carlos was saving her for me.\n\nCholita took that the wrong way. \u201cHe was saving me for my husband!!!\u201d\n\nI quickly corrected myself, and pointed out I\u2019m celibate, so whatever she was thinking wasn\u2019t what I meant.\n\nShe continued saying, Carlos noticed the Los Angeles gay thing also. He used to say that all LA men were, \"Chxxx??itas\".\n\nI couldn\u2019t catch the word. It was in Spanish.\n\nI realized, when Cholita was with \u201cthe Nagual\u201d, as she calls him, they spoke in Spanish.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I always forget that. I\u2019ve been told by the bi-lingual students from private classes that you haven\u2019t heard Carlos lecture at his best, until you\u2019ve heard him in Spanish. His command of Spanish was greater than his command of English, and the Spanish language has some words which are very suitable for describing some finer aspects of sorcery.\n\nI asked Cholita if Carlos cared about gay or not gay?\n\nAnd did he have sex with men?\n\nCholita said, \u201cHim??? No. He only liked women.\u201d \u201cBut he didn\u2019t care who fucked whom.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d add that in fact, some private class recruiting might have been because of LGB members of the inner circle. They brought in their friends.\n\nThere were definite statements by class members, after Carlos died, of lesbian orgies in the inner circle.\n\nAs one woman said, \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged to explore our sexuality!\u201d\n\nI asked Cholita if she thought Carlos was trying to introduce sperm to the women, for the energetic connection, which could go both ways.\n\nI pointed out that just being around her had completely disrupted my usual balance of energy, which I badly needed for assembling other worlds.\n\n\u201cHow should I know?!!?\u201d, she responded.\n\n\u201cAnd why do you want to change worlds so badly? Isn't this one weird enough for you already?\u201d", "edited": 1570902042.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f3frnlc", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Cholita mini-story.

He was also a member of the academy, so Cholita spent a lot of time watching movies with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually Cholita went mad, he didn&amp;#39;t realize that was the problem, and he threw her out for her angry behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s so far gone now that while eating a take-out bowl of soup in the car last night she became angry, showed me the bowl, and pointed out how quickly the soup had gone down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked her if she thought someone was eating it while she held it in her hand and she said, &amp;quot;Of course. You are!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike her husband, I don&amp;#39;t find that objectionable. I just try to figure out what&amp;#39;s going on. If there\u2019s a way to use Cholita for not-doing, I\u2019ll go for it. If we hadn\u2019t been driving, I would have insisted on searching the car for the soup stealing intruder. Even better, I might have been able to find one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her condition is almost surely a lateral shift of the assemblage point, due to some medical issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you learn to assemble other worlds, you\u2019ll become somewhat familiar with lateral shifts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They\u2019ve very disturbing. I believe don Juan called that realm, \u201cdiscarded junk\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, it\u2019s expected that a westerly witch goes mad, the examples being Josefina and Zuleica.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s certainly going to be a medical explanation for it, even if it&amp;#39;s naive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main thing is, it&amp;#39;s inevitable. Sorcery or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she still possess the qualities that make a westerly witch so useful. She plunges into the unknown, and can assemble it to make some sort of sense of it, even if it&amp;#39;s not all that rational.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to change the conversation to something more useful than a soup thief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that the one and only time I saw her husband, he looked a little gay to me. I even commented to the person who was with me, watching Cholita and her husband from a distance, doesn\u2019t he look a little gay?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep. They agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita got excited. &amp;quot;Yea, he must have been!!!&amp;quot;, she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither of us have anything against that. It&amp;#39;s just a possible explanation for why he threw Cholita out, which tickles her fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn\u2019t her, it was him. He was gay, that&amp;#39;s why he didn&amp;#39;t appreciate her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thinking of Corey, who probably wouldn&amp;#39;t like this conversation at all, I mentioned, maybe it&amp;#39;s just the LA style?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some sort of metro-sexual thing neither of us can understand because we&amp;#39;re old fogies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pointed out that the last time I went to Century City Mall, half the men seemed to me to be gay. Certainly the French kissing and extended hugging were possible warning signs. And all the hand holding on the escalators didn\u2019t help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita then started to tell me all kinds of things about Carlos. Gossipy stuff she hadn&amp;#39;t mentioned before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shouted, &amp;quot;Wait, don&amp;#39;t talk so fast!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s always noisy in the car, and very difficult to hear Cholita. She doesn&amp;#39;t pay much attention to which direction she&amp;#39;s talking, how loudly, or even whether anyone is actually listening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she always has both windows open, with music blasting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I leaned in towards her and was able to hear, &amp;quot;He didn&amp;#39;t like pubic hair.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was a reference to Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to ask her, but didn&amp;#39;t. A time or two her shorts had slipped a bit far, and it seemed like Cholita might also have gotten the command to shave it of. And perhaps kept it that way, along with the Chacmool hair style.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, that sounds better to me!&amp;quot;, I said instead. I wanted to offer a little encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered from Class that there was a controversy going around as to whether all the women were being pressured to shave their pubic hair. The best source of such rumors was Pat, whom I surely wish would notice this forum and come reminisce with us. The last time I told her what I&amp;#39;d learned to do with Carlos&amp;#39; techniques, I suspect she figured I&amp;#39;d gone crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point in private classes, I heard that Carlos would even have the women shave spiral patterns down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than being shocked, I wondered if I might be allowed to see an example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course there was the Sorcerer&amp;#39;s Cave on Malibu road, where he told the women to go and expose themselves to Malibu Beach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took a few up there myself. The cave is on a sheer and very high rock cliff, which you&amp;#39;ve already seen if you&amp;#39;ve watched a bunch of old movies. Cars often plunge to their doom off that cliff, when Hollywood doesn&amp;#39;t want to have to travel far to find a dangerous road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t walk within 6 feet of the cliff edge before my body freezes on the spot and my legs won&amp;#39;t move. But to get to the cave, you even have to make a leap of faith across a tiny tilted ledge, and into what looks like a carved out area with a couch made from the same rock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess, someone used that to hold cameras for a movie, and carved it just for that event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the rumor is that la Gorda sat in that cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For newbies, don&amp;#39;t judge Carlos based on his sexual antics. I\u2019m celibate because of Carlos, and hope to remain that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with Cholita around, I can assure everyone that sorcery and women results in sexual controversies. Hierarchies and loyalties have to be established, or women will mostly linger on the outskirts of commitment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As that Russian witch has said, women are all about building their kingdom. And if it&amp;#39;s torn down, the way Carlos tended to do with female apprentices, they&amp;#39;ll rebuild it from what they have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most practical way to resolve that is to fuck the women. I\u2019m sorry to say that, but there you have it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse, the women don&amp;#39;t mind at all. I have yet to find one with a complaint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita continued talking and I managed to hear, &amp;quot;I myself would have loved to fuck him, but I was never asked.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She went on, &amp;quot;The Nagual wasn&amp;#39;t what you would call a handsome man. But still most of the women wanted to fuck him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I just never got the chance&amp;quot;, she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggested, maybe Carlos was saving her for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita took that the wrong way. \u201cHe was saving me for my husband!!!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quickly corrected myself, and pointed out I\u2019m celibate, so whatever she was thinking wasn\u2019t what I meant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She continued saying, Carlos noticed the Los Angeles gay thing also. He used to say that all LA men were, &amp;quot;Chxxx??itas&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t catch the word. It was in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, when Cholita was with \u201cthe Nagual\u201d, as she calls him, they spoke in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know why I always forget that. I\u2019ve been told by the bi-lingual students from private classes that you haven\u2019t heard Carlos lecture at his best, until you\u2019ve heard him in Spanish. His command of Spanish was greater than his command of English, and the Spanish language has some words which are very suitable for describing some finer aspects of sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked Cholita if Carlos cared about gay or not gay?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And did he have sex with men?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita said, \u201cHim??? No. He only liked women.\u201d \u201cBut he didn\u2019t care who fucked whom.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d add that in fact, some private class recruiting might have been because of LGB members of the inner circle. They brought in their friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were definite statements by class members, after Carlos died, of lesbian orgies in the inner circle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As one woman said, \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged to explore our sexuality!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked Cholita if she thought Carlos was trying to introduce sperm to the women, for the energetic connection, which could go both ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pointed out that just being around her had completely disrupted my usual balance of energy, which I badly needed for assembling other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHow should I know?!!?\u201d, she responded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAnd why do you want to change worlds so badly? Isn&amp;#39;t this one weird enough for you already?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/de5uc9/out_and_about_with_the_dark_scout/f3frnlc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1570901555.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_de5uc9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f3nl8tz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_f3nalz4", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "At least we know that since Carlos has been \"discredited\" by some in the general populace, anyone who finds his work and chooses to practice is guaranteed to not be interested in increasing their social standing.\n\nUnless they want to be seen as a dangerous rebel or a pariah, which is I guess a sort of social standing.\n\nEdit: Recapitulation should indeed be step one along with Tensegrity for any beginners, I just wish I followed my own advice more reliably!

Everyone doing meditation and such is a giant phony.\n\nThat's mostly what you need to overcome, to reach the goal they've described.\n\nIt's just the internal dialogue, that's all. \n\nIt was taught to, \"Be a good baby and eat this cookie.  Your daddy and your sister are very proud of you!\"\n\nAbout my dark stories.  They're true, but the whole thing is mostly a trick. I have to remind myself of that once in a while, when I'm reluctant to post something.\n\nIt's a vaccine.  If Sunday Class members had gotten it, maybe it wouldn't be just Cholita and me now.\n\nThe 2 Cleargreens are still out there, but their main concern seems to be money.  And maybe social status.\n\nLet me add a side story to that mariachi mess.\n\nWith Cholita dancing and everyone else in the restaurant preoccupied, I can stare off into space without being noticed.\n\nWhen I'm with Cholita, I'm silent.    But still, nothing happened that day.    \n\nSo I watched to see if I was really silent.  Maybe I got distracted once in a while and broke it.\n\nTo test that theory, I held silence perfectly amidst all the commotion, until the lights overhead started to spin off lines of light. \n\nI had to check my glasses to see if maybe it was an optical effect, but they didn't seem to be the cause.\n\nI watched the lines emitting from the lights, and saw that they were carrying information.  I design information carrying systems, and it looked like data bits flowing along each strand of light.\n\nThree of four of them seemed to be in sync, and a cloud of purple mist stated to emerge.\n\nI got a sudden rush of sorts, but it wasn't a pleasant one.

No wonder don Juan called twilight, \"the crack between the worlds.\"\n\nIt was because full sunlight is a bitch.\n\nI feel sorry for practitioners who can't arrange darkness, and time at night.\n\nBut, when you fail, just remember this.  You weren't actually silent. That's all.  It's just very hard to be silent for the required time, in a busy restaurant.  Even latent images in the mind will hold the assemblage point in place.\n\nAnd recapitulation is MANDATORY!

Your daddy and your sister are very proud of you!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About my dark stories.  They&amp;#39;re true, but the whole thing is mostly a trick. I have to remind myself of that once in a while, when I&amp;#39;m reluctant to post something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a vaccine.  If Sunday Class members had gotten it, maybe it wouldn&amp;#39;t be just Cholita and me now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 2 Cleargreens are still out there, but their main concern seems to be money.  And maybe social status.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me add a side story to that mariachi mess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Cholita dancing and everyone else in the restaurant preoccupied, I can stare off into space without being noticed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m with Cholita, I&amp;#39;m silent.    But still, nothing happened that day.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I watched to see if I was really silent.  Maybe I got distracted once in a while and broke it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To test that theory, I held silence perfectly amidst all the commotion, until the lights overhead started to spin off lines of light. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to check my glasses to see if maybe it was an optical effect, but they didn&amp;#39;t seem to be the cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched the lines emitting from the lights, and saw that they were carrying information.  I design information carrying systems, and it looked like data bits flowing along each strand of light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three of four of them seemed to be in sync, and a cloud of purple mist stated to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a sudden rush of sorts, but it wasn&amp;#39;t a pleasant one.  Then I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I concluded, it&amp;#39;s REALLY hard to assemble another world, during the day.  No wonder don Juan called twilight, &amp;quot;the crack between the worlds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was because full sunlight is a bitch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel sorry for practitioners who can&amp;#39;t arrange darkness, and time at night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, when you fail, just remember this.  You weren&amp;#39;t actually silent. That&amp;#39;s all.  It&amp;#39;s just very hard to be silent for the required time, in a busy restaurant.  Even latent images in the mind will hold the assemblage point in place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And recapitulation is MANDATORY!  There&amp;#39;s no way on earth you&amp;#39;ll be able to let go of latent thoughts, if you haven&amp;#39;t gone over their cause, thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you cheat.

Most times we get nothing.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see it was the Mexican restaurant on top of a 4 story Korean mall. Cholita had found that place because she'd been staying at the Marriott Suites across the street from it before she fled to Seattle. She burned up all of her money in Seattle, I refused to buy her more hotel suites when she returned, and she ended up living with me.\n\nWe're on day #9 now.  She's taken over 2 bedrooms and the garage, and is thinking I need to build a garden house in the back yard, to go along with her new empire.\n\nHer complete hatred of me only lasts 80% of the day now. There's a good 10% where she can almost tolerate me, and maybe 10% where she's sort of nice.\n\nShe\u2019d taken me to that restaurant before, and I discovered that 2 of the people working in the restaurant had taken it upon themselves to protect her. I'd also found something I could eat there, even with my allergy.  Beans and corn tortillas.    All the rest of the items are potentially poisonous to me.\n\nThey waited on Cholita so well that her behavior towards them became almost pleasant. She still failed to tip anyone, but she made sure I made up for it when I was present.\n\nThis time we got the male of the pair of protectors. He\u2019s nearly flamboyantly gay, without being over the top.  For some odd reason, younger gay men take a fancy to me, and even test the flirting possibilities.\n\nHe sized me and Cholita up instantly, and decided we needed help in the bedroom.\n\nAnd so aside from letting Cholita go table hopping until she was satisfied,  he performed what he knew was my favorite service.\n\nHe kept an eye on Cholita\u2019s wine glass. And after she decided to go for a second one, he came back with a glass which had double the normal amount. It was actually 2 glasses of wine.\n\nAnd he filled my glass up halfway so that she'd be encouraged to \"catch up\".\n\nNeither drink appeared on the bill.\n\nI slipped him a huge tip under the table, and he nodded wickedly.\n\nAll night long if I glanced in his direction, he picked up on it within seconds. He also strolled by occasionally to see if Cholita was happy or angry and whether he could help.\n\nThe restaurant had a mostly female Mariachi quartet. They were incredibly talented. The lead woman could play 5 different instruments, and switched out every song.\n\nThere was a male playing what looked to me like a well decorated pregnant base guitar. Cholita had to look that one up in Spanish, and laughed when I asked what it means.\n\n\u201cBig ass Mexican Guitar\u201d, was her best answer.\n\nThe Mexican women eating in the packed restaurant all seemed to know the lyrics of each song, and Cholita demonstrated her \u201cAiy yai yai yaaa hahahaaa!!!\u201d shout, which sort of reminded me why I hate mariachi music.\n\nExcept these guys were good!\n\nThe middle-aged Mexican women all got up in a group to dance. Cholita stood to dance in place a few times.\n\nAll the commotion caused her to take another gulp of that full wine glass every few minutes.\n\nAfter it became obvious that Cholita was smashed, she began to tell more stories.\n\nThe last one got a little dark. I won't explain why, but if you read all the gossip after Carlos died, you can read between the lines.\n\nBeing smashed on Merlot, Cholita admitted she must be a scout. She hadn\u2019t thought about it before, but that\u2019s all she\u2019s done her entire life.\n\nShe explained that she constantly pushes herself into situations she should avoid. She didn\u2019t want to use the word stubborn, but a part of her personality is to go where she isn\u2019t supposed to go, and to ruthlessly break down any barriers along the way. Especially people.\n\n\"I've met some bad men\", she added. \"But it didn't matter. It wasn't love, it was passion.\"\n\n\"And I suppose some would call me bad also.\"\n\nShe explained that the \u201creal\u201d her is watching, and knows it\u2019s going to turn out badly. But the other part ends up having control.\n\nAnd so she goes from one shit-hole to the next, incredulous that she allowed herself to get into that situation.\n\nI asked her for how long? For example, did it include her first marriage?\n\nForever, she said! Life after life. Each one the same. But **always**, there\u2019s a way out of the shit-hole.\n\nI reminded her that the \u201cblue scout\u201d had scouted herself to death.\n\nCholita didn\u2019t need to be reminded. She said, \u201cWell, maybe she had some passion for the Nagual!\"\n\nShe added that even when she finds the way out of her latest shit-hole, the next one is even more challenging.\n\n\"This time I've lost everything!\", she exclaimed.\n\n\u201cIt was Carlos who brought me here from Mexico. \u201c, she added.\n\nI replied, \u201cAnd he kind of took everything away from you.\"\n\n\u201cYes, he took everything\u201d, she admitted.\n\nI pointed out that she was here with me now, so she hadn\u2019t lost everything.\n\nI suggested she might decide to follow *intent* from now on, and give up trying to find happiness.\n\nI tried to explain what I believed to be Carlos\u2019 strategy.\n\nI collected some things from the table, paired off 2 of the squarest, and said that was Cleargreen.\n\nBut Carlos created tension in it, and it split into 2.\n\n\"That's Cleargreen, that's Miles and Aerin\".\n\nCholita nodded her head yes.\n\nI put 2 of the smallest objects on another empty spot and told her, \u201cThat\u2019s us!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re faction #3. Properly it should include Corey, Felix, Pat, Victoria, Leigh, Virginia\u2026\u201d\n\n\"But we're all that's left.\"\n\nCholita said maybe that was true. But then she lifted up her left hand to make a middle finger.\n\nHer fingernails were painted turquoise, and her hands were quite dark from being homeless.\n\nEven though she was flipping someone off, it was very pleasant to look at. Bracelets and beads dangled from her tattooed wrist.\n\nShe said, \u201cIf the Nagual himself showed up at this table, explaining how he\u2019d created Faction #3, this is what I\u2019d tell him.\u201d\n\nShe jerked her finger up in the air to show how she\u2019d flip off Carlos if she could.\n\n\u201cHe left us. I would have followed him anywhere. That\u2019s the kind of devotion I had to his cause. But he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nI tried to change the subject to something more pleasant, but failed miserably when I said, \u201cThere\u2019s at least one more faction we don\u2019t know about. And maybe 2.\u201d\n\nI reminded her of Tony.\n\nWhen I mentioned Tony Lama, the lost Nagual, Cholita exclaimed, \u201cOhhh\u2026. Margarita had a huge thing for him! That was all she could think about. Tony, Tony, Tony\u2026\u201d\n\nI was very surprised, because I\u2019d only seen Tony the one time Carlos brought him to class to be introduced. We all knew ahead of time that he was a double being.\n\nI realized, the reason I knew he was a double was because of gossip from women. Maybe Carlos was deliberately putting him into contact with them to form some kind of \"bond\".\n\nBut Tony didn\u2019t bite.\n\nI reported to Cholita that Tony was still out there, and had been in a Russian movie.\n\nCholita went on, \u201cMargarita used to make me sleep in bed with her. That\u2019s how I found out she had a thing for Tony.\u201d\n\nHer head started to shake \"no\" in a rhythmical manner.\n\nHer schizophrenia often makes her hands shake, especially when she\u2019s under heavy stress.\n\nBut for her head to shake like that, it has to be something that bothers her very seriously.\n\nShe went on a little further, her head still shaking \u201cno\u201d in a rhythmical manner.\n\n\u201cMargarita used to make me\u2026\u201d\n\nShe stopped there.\n\nEdited: once", "edited": 1570994977.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f3myvf4", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet another mini-story, in lieu of me getting enough time to finish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, after buying up half of Home Depot, I was surprised to find that Cholita had already picked out a restaurant for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually we drive around for a half hour, with Cholita rejecting everything in the path.

She said, \u201cWell, maybe she had some passion for the Nagual!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She added that even when she finds the way out of her latest shit-hole, the next one is even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This time I&amp;#39;ve lost everything!&amp;quot;, she exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was Carlos who brought me here from Mexico. \u201c, she added.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I replied, \u201cAnd he kind of took everything away from you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYes, he took everything\u201d, she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pointed out that she was here with me now, so she hadn\u2019t lost everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggested she might decide to follow &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; from now on, and give up trying to find happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to explain what I believed to be Carlos\u2019 strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I collected some things from the table, paired off 2 of the squarest, and said that was Cleargreen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos created tension in it, and it split into 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s Cleargreen, that&amp;#39;s Miles and Aerin&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita nodded her head yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put 2 of the smallest objects on another empty spot and told her, \u201cThat\u2019s us!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe\u2019re faction #3. Properly it should include Corey, Felix, Pat, Victoria, Leigh, Virginia\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But we&amp;#39;re all that&amp;#39;s left.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita said maybe that was true. But then she lifted up her left hand to make a middle finger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her fingernails were painted turquoise, and her hands were quite dark from being homeless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though she was flipping someone off, it was very pleasant to look at. Bracelets and beads dangled from her tattooed wrist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, \u201cIf the Nagual himself showed up at this table, explaining how he\u2019d created Faction #3, this is what I\u2019d tell him.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She jerked her finger up in the air to show how she\u2019d flip off Carlos if she could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe left us. I would have followed him anywhere. That\u2019s the kind of devotion I had to his cause. But he\u2019s gone.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to change the subject to something more pleasant, but failed miserably when I said, \u201cThere\u2019s at least one more faction we don\u2019t know about. And maybe 2.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reminded her of Tony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned Tony Lama, the lost Nagual, Cholita exclaimed, \u201cOhhh\u2026. Margarita had a huge thing for him! That was all she could think about. Tony, Tony, Tony\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was very surprised, because I\u2019d only seen Tony the one time Carlos brought him to class to be introduced. We all knew ahead of time that he was a double being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, the reason I knew he was a double was because of gossip from women. Maybe Carlos was deliberately putting him into contact with them to form some kind of &amp;quot;bond&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Tony didn\u2019t bite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reported to Cholita that Tony was still out there, and had been in a Russian movie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita went on, \u201cMargarita used to make me sleep in bed with her. That\u2019s how I found out she had a thing for Tony.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her head started to shake &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; in a rhythmical manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her schizophrenia often makes her hands shake, especially when she\u2019s under heavy stress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for her head to shake like that, it has to be something that bothers her very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She went on a little further, her head still shaking \u201cno\u201d in a rhythmical manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMargarita used to make me\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stopped there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: once&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/de5uc9/out_and_about_with_the_dark_scout/f3myvf4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1570993420.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_de5uc9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f3u85dp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_f3rn3c1", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "As far as I'm concerned, she's just scouting as usual.\n\nI had the freakiest experience with her last night.\n\nThe thing about waking dreaming (Zuleica's technique will produce that), is that you're completely lucid and already in dreaming.

If she wants to know something, I'm sure one of the people in here can dig it up for her.\n\nCholita recited this story while driving with me to buy 4 overflowing shopping carts of household items, such as dish racks, cupboard organizers, soft pads for shelves, and a huge assortment of  \"The Container Store\" stuff.\n\nIt was in fact the second day in a row that we'd done that. First day was for bathroom and bedroom goodies.\n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t know how it came to be, but Cholita decided to take up art restoration.\n\nMy guess?

There was still a lot of Spanish Colonial Art floating around in Mexican antique stores back then.\n\nCarlos was handling collections which undoubtedly needed a little restoring before being resold.\n\nShe also ended up in a series of museum and art gallery jobs, including a gallery with the name, \u201cChacmool\u201d, while stranded by Carlos in Santa Monica until she grew up a bit, cut her hair, and stopped smoking.\n\nIt really looks like stalking to me, but there\u2019s no way these days to confirm it.\n\nThe best day of her life started when, for a reason she won\u2019t explain, they had to stop working on the art they were restoring, in a church run by a charming old Italian priest.\n\nMaybe it was the local townspeople throwing rocks through the glass windows, landing on the art they were restoring. Or maybe it was the refusal of the Hotel Managers where they stayed, to arrange taxi rides for them.\n\nWhatever the reason, Cholita and her friend took a boat to an island off the coast of some Podunk town in Texas.\n\nOn the island, they found Cholita\u2019s dream come true. Several handsome Europeans (Germanic regions?) were stranded on the Island, like Tom Hanks.  The way she tells it, I can almost picture their pants all ripped up to their knees, and them running out begging for food and fresh water.\n\nI'm sure that's not how it went, but that's the image I had in my mind as she told it.  Probably the truth is, they just missed the last boat to the mainland and didn't want to wait for the next one.\n\nEither way, Cholita and friend got to rescue the Europeans, who came back and stayed with them in the hotel.\n\nI have a picture of Cholita from back then. No man would pass on going back to her hotel room.\n\nAt night, as if on Que, a band of Jamaican musicians showed up, and gave a free outdoor concert at the hotel.\n\nThey partied all night together.

A rotary dial selects one of 16 colors, which includes white of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All on is sunlight levels (well, 25K lux at least), all off is complete darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using that, you could practice until you can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; another world, then slowly turn up the light to try to keep it in sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone feels enterprising, I can draw up a schematic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t have any time to build one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cost is around $25.  If we had a community, I suspect you could sell those for $300.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could call it, &amp;quot;Perma-&lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_de5uc9", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/de5uc9/out_and_about_with_the_dark_scout/f3xzbta/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1571246250.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1571246250.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f3vep4g", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_f3v6u1w", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "There's some difference, but I suspect that how we view those worlds is tainted by this one.\n\nAs Carol Tiggs implied, we might not ever know how they look to the inhabitants.\n\nThat world is also similar to how Carlos described the one he visited in one of his books.

It was like a Harry Potter movie.\n\nI had all the time in the world.\n\nEvery night I\u2019d interact with my fairy, and the next day I had only to look for her. She always came to play again.\n\nI visited other worlds, stopped this one, and watched, \u201cthe wall\u201d. I had occasional visits from Carlos\u2019 allies.\n\nMy biggest problem was, is there any way to pass on Carlos\u2019 knowledge so that it isn\u2019t lost?\n\nAnd maybe I needed another person, to verify shared dreaming and maybe violate a little causality.\n\nThat was my life until Cholita dropped into my garage.\n\nI needed another person, and here was one.\n\nConsidering the pursuit of happiness, I should have called the police.\n\nBut pursuing *intent* is different. If you\u2019re given something, you have to decide whether to use it or reject it.\n\nBut not based on happiness. Based on whether it furthers the goal that brought it there.\n\nI took her in. Now it\u2019s non-stop chaos, arguing, and sexual innuendo. I\u2019m lucky to get 5 hours of sleep..\n\nAnd there\u2019s only one Cholita. Carlos had dozens.\n\nWhen Cholita finally went too mad to take care of herself, she went in search of people to help her.\n\nShe didn\u2019t last more than a few days with each. Even the former Carlos \"insiders\" have returned to the \u201cpursuit of happiness\u201d, and Cholita isn\u2019t any help for that goal.\n\nA few days ago, just one day after I\u2019d finally convinced Cholita to live with me, she insisted we needed a large cleaning crew to scrub down and clean everything in my home.\n\nI scheduled a cleaning crew for early the next day, and requested we might just have a quiet evening, since I had to get up early to manage them.\n\nShe agreed. I repeated it. She promised.\n\nAs we drove towards Whole Foods Market I noticed that she was twirling her fat metal ring.\n\nShe seemed to be going in and out of a trance.\n\nCholita finally commented, \u201cThis is good for Meditation!\u201d\n\nAfter a while she began to laugh. She laughed so hard that she fell on her side. I asked what was so funny?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy, that\u2019s all!\u201d, she said.\n\nUnfortunately, her laughing usually means her mood is swinging. I\u2019ve theorized from lectures Carlos gave that her assemblage point is shifting along a lateral path, and can\u2019t quite find its way to normal.\n\nIn Cholita\u2019s typical series of mood swings, anger comes after laughing.\n\nThe next words out of her mouth were, \u201cThis is intolerable!!! It\u2019s crazy!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t our idea\u201d, I said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t choose this, did you?\u201d\n\nShe nodded no.\n\nAnd I pointed out, I had no choice. She was homeless, and came to my garage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pawns of Carlos!\u201d, I joked.\n\nBut Cholita got angrier.\n\nI suggested, we\u2019re pawns of *intent* then.\n\nShe nodded yes, almost imperceptibly.\n\nAfter a marathon grocery shopping spree, we went for dinner. Cholita pulled her usual tricks and secured us a table against the restaurant rules.\n\nI asked her a very important question.  How did you get invited to come join Carlos' group?  And what did he say to you about it.\n\nI don't remember the entire conversation, but when she told me what Carlos had said to her, it stuck in my mind.\n\nHe'd had to take everything away from her, and strand her here.  Margarita was given the task of providing a place to stay, but Cholita had to work a few jobs first, cut her hair, and quit smoking.\n\nWhen Carlos spoke to her about it,  it was a conversation about her flaws and what was holding her back.\n\nI've known her for more than 20 years. It was easy to recognize what he meant.\n\nCholita finally said that Carlos also told her, \"I'll be intimate with you one way or the other.\"\n\nI took that to mean, I needed to do the same or Cholita wouldn't commit.\n\nAfter a grueling dinner where Cholita constantly demanded modifications to her food, it was time to go.\n\nExcept that she wanted to check out one more thing. There was an essential oil sold at Old World Village nearby, which helped her remain calm.\n\nWe went looking for it. But as it turned out, Cholita was more interested in Oktober Fest. It\u2019s located in the same village.\n\nShe requested to go in for a bit.\n\nI thought for sure she\u2019d find off duty strippers trying to seduce nerds, and turn around and leave.\n\nInstead, she entered a beer drinking contest. She took off her coat to reveal a sexy outfit, pranced to the stage, and participated in trying to down a glass of beer the fastest.\n\nThat was followed by dancing. Cholita was good.\n\nShe partied for an hour, found a German filled pastry, and started laughing as she squeezed filling from it.\n\nShe stood there a good 2 or 3 minutes, slowly squeezing the filling out.\n\nI knew anger came next in her mood cycle, so I reminded her that we had to leave soon.\n\nOn the way to the car she said, \u201cMaybe I should go back to partying every night!\u201d\n\nWhile I pondered that she added, \u201cBut I have to get fucked afterwards!\u201d\n\nShe giggled the rest of the way to the car.\n\nWe went home, and both of us went to our rooms.\n\nI tried to fall asleep, while listening to see if Cholita was ok.\n\nThere was no sound. I sat up to see if there were colors in the darkness.\n\nInstead of blobs, there was a patchy purple fog. The patches of light were a foot wide, drifting slowly around the room.\n\nI\u2019d never seen that!. It seemed to be coming from Cholita\u2019s room.\n\nI watched in silence, when the back of my neck popped.\n\nI remembered that Carlos had written about that, saying it signals that the second attention is coming out.\n\nI silently waited for something to happen, blanked out, and heard the pop again.\n\nI could feel my dreaming body stand up while I remained sitting. I was in both places.\n\nNow here\u2019s where I have to make a confession. Dreaming often has no connection to normal events.\n\nTo go back and remember the sequence is often impossible. There\u2019s nothing to connect them.\n\nI\u2019ve lost the order. I\u2019ll just guess.\n\nI got up to test Cholita\u2019s fog. Can I compress it?\n\nWhen I walked to the center of it, details formed. Concrete flower bed walls to sit on and pathways for foot traffic.\n\nIt became a dream of an outdoor area for people. A few days later Cholita even mentioned a park she visited in Seattle.\n\nIn this fog generated landscape, I could see into the distance. My bedroom walls were no longer the limit.\n\nThe fog had details which that stretched on like a real location, except that I was still standing on my bedroom floor.\n\nI sensed that she was down the path towards the right.\n\nI can\u2019t recall why now, but I wasn\u2019t able to follow her into that dream.\n\nThe best I can remember is, I was reluctant to head down that path because Cholita\u2019s real body was in fact located in the same direction, in her bedroom.\n\nI gave up on that dream and the patchy fog returned.\n\nI decided to try scooping it. I managed to gather a patch into my hands. I could manipulate it using the techniques Carlos taught us.\n\nI found Zoltar floating above on my right. Except that something was wrong.\n\nHe was missing the spinny thing and his lights were dim.\n\nI managed to scoop him into my hand. I tried blowing into it, but his lights didn\u2019t change.\n\nHe\u2019d developed a membrane. He looked like a deflated balloon. I could see his little lights inside this \u201ccontainer\u201d.\n\nZoltar looked ill.\n\nThe patchy fog was still thick. I decided to toss Zoltar, the same way I\u2019d tossed my fairy.\n\nI lifted Zoltar up but instead of throwing him I just pushed him in the right direction. Maybe he\u2019d pick up energy.\n\nThe fog compressed as he pushed towards my bedroom wall, but details formed before he reached it.\n\nZoltar had drifted through the purple until he was past my bedroom.\n\nIt was his home! I recognized it.\n\nThe cliff sucked him into a hole and his head became visible.\n\nI turned around to see if there were more of his kind, but I was back in my bedroom.\n\nThe dreamscape was gone.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen Zoltar since.", "edited": 1571176837.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f3uupw8", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2: A Peaceful Evening&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is convey what we learned in Carlos\u2019 book, \u201cThe Second Ring of Power\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices suck!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So keep in mind how much trouble Cholita is, and I hope it serves to mellow out criticisms of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a year ago I was living in my own tidy Sorcery world.

Concrete flower bed walls to sit on and pathways for foot traffic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It became a dream of an outdoor area for people. A few days later Cholita even mentioned a park she visited in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this fog generated landscape, I could see into the distance. My bedroom walls were no longer the limit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fog had details which that stretched on like a real location, except that I was still standing on my bedroom floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sensed that she was down the path towards the right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t recall why now, but I wasn\u2019t able to follow her into that dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best I can remember is, I was reluctant to head down that path because Cholita\u2019s real body was in fact located in the same direction, in her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gave up on that dream and the patchy fog returned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to try scooping it. I managed to gather a patch into my hands. I could manipulate it using the techniques Carlos taught us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found Zoltar floating above on my right. Except that something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was missing the spinny thing and his lights were dim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I managed to scoop him into my hand. I tried blowing into it, but his lights didn\u2019t change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019d developed a membrane. He looked like a deflated balloon. I could see his little lights inside this \u201ccontainer\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zoltar looked ill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The patchy fog was still thick. I decided to toss Zoltar, the same way I\u2019d tossed my fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lifted Zoltar up but instead of throwing him I just pushed him in the right direction. Maybe he\u2019d pick up energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fog compressed as he pushed towards my bedroom wall, but details formed before he reached it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zoltar had drifted through the purple until he was past my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was his home! I recognized it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cliff sucked him into a hole and his head became visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned around to see if there were more of his kind, but I was back in my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dreamscape was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven\u2019t seen Zoltar since.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/de5uc9/out_and_about_with_the_dark_scout/f3uupw8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1571167699.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_de5uc9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f4mp84l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_f4jgnc2", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I ran into martial arts practitioners who could make their hands warm or cold.\n\nI just wish Cholita was more coherent.

Cholita had insisted we could park there, in a very tall building\u2019s subterranean parking garage.\n\nBut when we emerged it was obvious we\u2019d made a mistake.\n\nCholita got out her cell phone, which had walking directions on it.

The people in charge said she still had time to go to the bathroom.\n\nCholita disappeared for 10 minutes. The worried managers of the show asked if they should go in there, and I had to explain.\n\nShe\u2019s schizophrenic. Going in there would be the worst thing. Just start the show.\n\nThe main man, perhaps the creator of the video, was at the top of the stairs when Cholita finally emerged. He seemed to have been informed about Cholita, and was also familiar with paranoid schizophrenia, possibly from his association with a lot of lovers. He was an older man, with a kind but pessimistic outlook on life, and an LA patronizing way of talking to others.\n\nYea, we\u2019ll do lunch for sure!\n\nThat kind of thing.\n\nHe guided Cholita up the steps, telling her she was going to be more relaxed with every step, and by the time she reached the top, she\u2019d be completely at peace.\n\nOr something like that. Cholita loved it.\n\nShe went in to the dome to watch Mesmerica, his latest 360 degree creation.\n\nI looked at a monitor outside the dome, and realized, this guy was sort of the Carlos Castaneda of the Tonal.\n\nHis videos were designed to give the kinds of experiences you get by navigating and changing worlds.\n\nHe wanted to help people by providing them with perceptual experiences that make them feel better, but didn\u2019t have any actual sorcery knowledge.\n\nSo he used computers.\n\nI was practically drooling thinking about what a great recreation he could produce, of scooping colors in the darkness, and assembling other worlds.\n\nSo I tried the direct approach, seeing as how he was old enough to know who Castaneda was.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t interested (didn\u2019t believe we were the long lost and genuine apprentices of Carlos Castaneda).\n\nHe asked about Cholita, I told him the truth, that we were both fossils from the hippy movement and that Cholita had gone mad, and I was taking care of her.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say it was a noble thing to do. Instead, he asked why I would do that?\n\nFrom his point of view, possibly been there and done that, he figured there was no way to get along with a paranoid schizophrenic, so I should just save some time and drop her off at skid row.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say that, but he was almost surely thinking it.\n\nI gave up, realizing that Cholita is absolutely nothing more than an ungrateful incredible burden, to anyone involved in the pursuit of happiness.\n\nAny progress you make with her will blow away at the next mood change, and there\u2019s no rationality or gratitude in her paranoid delusions.\n\nIf someone else took over protection, she\u2019d hate them just as much as she does me, inside a day or two.\n\nWe left the event with Cholita saying she was hungry, and proceeded to the nearest expensive restaurant (one with \u201cclass\u201d as Cholita put it). Cholita used her usual tricks to cut the 1.5 hour wait in line, and ended up with multiple servants fawning over her, taking care of her constant unreasonable demands. She even got the chef involved.\n\nFollowing that, we spent the next 3 hours taking pictures all over the city. Architectural features, interesting homeless encampments, depressed looking couples behind the windows of the buildings we passed.\n\nShe filled her phone with so many pictures, and we walked so far, that she got hungry again.\n\nShe found the nearest huge and expensive hotel, went up several floors to a high up lobby, and found a banquet for Syrians.\n\nCholita helped herself to a pastry and Middle Eastern Coriander spiced tea, chatting with the few people who actually belonged at the convention as if they were old friends.\n\nFinally the manager came over, said she could keep what she had, but that it was a private event and we had to leave.\n\nCholita remained much longer than the manager wanted, insisting she had to finish her pastry and tea. I reminded her that Carlos had taken her off of caffeine, and she was still honoring that for the most part. I\u2019d never seen her drink caffeinated tea before. She also didn\u2019t typically eat sugary treats, since Carlos restricted those for a few months.\n\nShe smiled and said, \u201cBut it was free!\u201d\n\nCholita insisted on taking elevators up and down to the wrong places, until we emerged nowhere, and I said we needed to ask someone. We found a romantic couple walking along holding hands, I asked, and they pointed down their path. The parking garage is right there!\n\nI was so tired when the ordeal was over and I was back in my own bedroom, that I didn\u2019t even feel like sleeping. I just wanted to restore heightened awareness, so the fatigue would go away.\n\nThe instant I turned off the lights in the room there was a purple fog of patchy spots, brighter than any background noise I\u2019d ever seen. It was somehow related to Cholita.\n\nI discovered that it worked pretty much the same as the individual clouds of energy you might normally see in darkness. You could compress it until it got so bright that it was even rivaling the sun. You could toss balls of it, and you could scoop it.\n\nThe main difference was, it was everywhere, seemingly blowing from Cholita\u2019s direction.\n\nAt that point I\u2019d been forcing silence and scooping long enough to become completely \u201cinnocent\u201d. I didn\u2019t have any expectations about what anything \u201cshould\u201d look like. Not even the patches of fog. And I undoubtedly did a bunch of other interesting things, but they've faded from memory.\n\nWhen I finally noticed I was standing at the end of my bed, amidst the purple fog,  I looked to my left at one that was a little stronger than the rest.  It rearranged itself and Cholita\u2019s head emerged. And a bit of her shoulder, and what she was wearing. But at the time I was too innocent to notice.\n\nThe first thing I observed was, this wasn\u2019t like a hypnogogic image. Those tend to be transparent, and look like they\u2019re actually just line drawings, made from purple and blue light.\n\nThis was a full dreaming image, as real as anything you might view in a dream. Solid, not transparent, and just hanging out there in my actual room, in the darkness. I could even make out some details of the room, because of the light being given off by this dreaming copy of Cholita\u2019s head.\n\nI had to look down to see it, but the height was just about right, for short Cholita standing on my left.\n\nExcept, it was the younger Cholita, who Carlos imported to the states.  It looked like a young woman's face illuminated by her cell phone, in the darkness.\n\nI looked closer, and that got the notice of the head.  It was looking downwards, but turned very slightly like it sensed I was viewing it.  It had Cholita's unmistakable angry smirk.\n\nIt started to walk away, and as it moved forward it painted the pathway until it was a full dreaming walkway, exiting my bedroom through the wall. Cholita walked off quickly.\n\nI\u2019d been banned from following her, so I tried to find her from an aerial view.\n\nDon\u2019t ask me how I knew you can do that. I used to do it sitting in a chair, forcing silence. I\u2019d try to hover over LA, headed towards Dance Home, which was Carlos central territory.\n\nBut it never occurred to me to be doing that while playing with colors in the darkness.  It reminded me of tensegrity passes Carlos taught at Maui, where a ball of energy is sent high into the air, using a glance.\n\nI realized, I toss balls of energy horizontally, but Carlos showed how to project them upwards. I needed to give that a try.  Maybe it can be like sending up a drone, to get an aerial video stream.\n\nWell yes. Of course it can be!\n\nI saw a few dreaming scenes sitting up on pillows while looking down at the bedspread to search for Cholita. I'm not sure how I got back on the bed.\n\nI appeared to be hovering over the scenes, around 50 feet in the air. Except that, my view of the scene was wider than it ought to have been from 50 feet away.  I'd say it was somehow the width of a 200 foot high view, spatially compressed so that the discrepancy was unnoticeable.\n\nEventually I found Cholita walking along at a lively pace, in a village or small residential area in Mexico.  I was looking down at a 45 degree angle, like a video game perspective for watching cities build themselves.\n\nI have no idea how I knew it was Mexico. I just heard the thought, \"Oh, there she is in Mexico!\"  It wasn't my thought, so I took it as factual. And yet, it ***was*** my thought.\n\nI tried to get Cholita\u2019s attention. She hadn\u2019t banned me from doing that. But it didn\u2019t work, so I formed a claw and tried to scoop dark energy.  I could beam it over to her. That might get her attention.\n\nBut she was walking fast, and would soon be out of my view.  I raised my right arm with a fist, and tried to beam whatever little dark energy I\u2019d managed to scoop up. I learned that trick by summoning one of Carlos\u2019 allies.\n\nIt was too late. Nothing came from my fist, and Cholita was only 10 feet from being outside my view. I pushed my fist into the scene, and it shattered into pieces.\n\nThey floated about in the air. The largest chunk fell into my hands. It had turned from a normal twilight scene of Mexico to a pinkish orange glowing chunk the size of a longish broken block of concrete. It was animated with the scene of the village.\n\nCholita wasn\u2019t in there. I looked at the other pieces floating in the air, hoping she was in one of them.\n\nBut they were too jumbled up to investigate thoroughly.\n\nEdited: twice", "edited": 1571608513.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f4i9xpl", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last chunk of day 3:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We landed very far from the Tensegrity Dome.

Cholita loved it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She went in to the dome to watch Mesmerica, his latest 360 degree creation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at a monitor outside the dome, and realized, this guy was sort of the Carlos Castaneda of the Tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His videos were designed to give the kinds of experiences you get by navigating and changing worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wanted to help people by providing them with perceptual experiences that make them feel better, but didn\u2019t have any actual sorcery knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he used computers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was practically drooling thinking about what a great recreation he could produce, of scooping colors in the darkness, and assembling other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I tried the direct approach, seeing as how he was old enough to know who Castaneda was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wasn\u2019t interested (didn\u2019t believe we were the long lost and genuine apprentices of Carlos Castaneda).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He asked about Cholita, I told him the truth, that we were both fossils from the hippy movement and that Cholita had gone mad, and I was taking care of her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn\u2019t say it was a noble thing to do. Instead, he asked why I would do that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From his point of view, possibly been there and done that, he figured there was no way to get along with a paranoid schizophrenic, so I should just save some time and drop her off at skid row.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn\u2019t say that, but he was almost surely thinking it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gave up, realizing that Cholita is absolutely nothing more than an ungrateful incredible burden, to anyone involved in the pursuit of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any progress you make with her will blow away at the next mood change, and there\u2019s no rationality or gratitude in her paranoid delusions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone else took over protection, she\u2019d hate them just as much as she does me, inside a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We left the event with Cholita saying she was hungry, and proceeded to the nearest expensive restaurant (one with \u201cclass\u201d as Cholita put it). Cholita used her usual tricks to cut the 1.5 hour wait in line, and ended up with multiple servants fawning over her, taking care of her constant unreasonable demands. She even got the chef involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following that, we spent the next 3 hours taking pictures all over the city. Architectural features, interesting homeless encampments, depressed looking couples behind the windows of the buildings we passed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She filled her phone with so many pictures, and we walked so far, that she got hungry again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She found the nearest huge and expensive hotel, went up several floors to a high up lobby, and found a banquet for Syrians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita helped herself to a pastry and Middle Eastern Coriander spiced tea, chatting with the few people who actually belonged at the convention as if they were old friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally the manager came over, said she could keep what she had, but that it was a private event and we had to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita remained much longer than the manager wanted, insisting she had to finish her pastry and tea. I reminded her that Carlos had taken her off of caffeine, and she was still honoring that for the most part. I\u2019d never seen her drink caffeinated tea before. She also didn\u2019t typically eat sugary treats, since Carlos restricted those for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She smiled and said, \u201cBut it was free!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita insisted on taking elevators up and down to the wrong places, until we emerged nowhere, and I said we needed to ask someone. We found a romantic couple walking along holding hands, I asked, and they pointed down their path. The parking garage is right there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so tired when the ordeal was over and I was back in my own bedroom, that I didn\u2019t even feel like sleeping. I just wanted to restore heightened awareness, so the fatigue would go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The instant I turned off the lights in the room there was a purple fog of patchy spots, brighter than any background noise I\u2019d ever seen. It was somehow related to Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I discovered that it worked pretty much the same as the individual clouds of energy you might normally see in darkness. You could compress it until it got so bright that it was even rivaling the sun. You could toss balls of it, and you could scoop it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main difference was, it was everywhere, seemingly blowing from Cholita\u2019s direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point I\u2019d been forcing silence and scooping long enough to become completely \u201cinnocent\u201d. I didn\u2019t have any expectations about what anything \u201cshould\u201d look like. Not even the patches of fog. And I undoubtedly did a bunch of other interesting things, but they&amp;#39;ve faded from memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I finally noticed I was standing at the end of my bed, amidst the purple fog,  I looked to my left at one that was a little stronger than the rest.  It rearranged itself and Cholita\u2019s head emerged. And a bit of her shoulder, and what she was wearing. But at the time I was too innocent to notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing I observed was, this wasn\u2019t like a hypnogogic image. Those tend to be transparent, and look like they\u2019re actually just line drawings, made from purple and blue light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a full dreaming image, as real as anything you might view in a dream. Solid, not transparent, and just hanging out there in my actual room, in the darkness. I could even make out some details of the room, because of the light being given off by this dreaming copy of Cholita\u2019s head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to look down to see it, but the height was just about right, for short Cholita standing on my left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, it was the younger Cholita, who Carlos imported to the states.  It looked like a young woman&amp;#39;s face illuminated by her cell phone, in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked closer, and that got the notice of the head.  It was looking downwards, but turned very slightly like it sensed I was viewing it.  It had Cholita&amp;#39;s unmistakable angry smirk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It started to walk away, and as it moved forward it painted the pathway until it was a full dreaming walkway, exiting my bedroom through the wall. Cholita walked off quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d been banned from following her, so I tried to find her from an aerial view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t ask me how I knew you can do that. I used to do it sitting in a chair, forcing silence. I\u2019d try to hover over LA, headed towards Dance Home, which was Carlos central territory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it never occurred to me to be doing that while playing with colors in the darkness.  It reminded me of tensegrity passes Carlos taught at Maui, where a ball of energy is sent high into the air, using a glance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, I toss balls of energy horizontally, but Carlos showed how to project them upwards. I needed to give that a try.  Maybe it can be like sending up a drone, to get an aerial video stream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well yes. Of course it can be!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a few dreaming scenes sitting up on pillows while looking down at the bedspread to search for Cholita. I&amp;#39;m not sure how I got back on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appeared to be hovering over the scenes, around 50 feet in the air. Except that, my view of the scene was wider than it ought to have been from 50 feet away.  I&amp;#39;d say it was somehow the width of a 200 foot high view, spatially compressed so that the discrepancy was unnoticeable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found Cholita walking along at a lively pace, in a village or small residential area in Mexico.  I was looking down at a 45 degree angle, like a video game perspective for watching cities build themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how I knew it was Mexico. I just heard the thought, &amp;quot;Oh, there she is in Mexico!&amp;quot;  It wasn&amp;#39;t my thought, so I took it as factual. And yet, it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; my thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to get Cholita\u2019s attention. She hadn\u2019t banned me from doing that. But it didn\u2019t work, so I formed a claw and tried to scoop dark energy.  I could beam it over to her. That might get her attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she was walking fast, and would soon be out of my view.  I raised my right arm with a fist, and tried to beam whatever little dark energy I\u2019d managed to scoop up. I learned that trick by summoning one of Carlos\u2019 allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was too late. Nothing came from my fist, and Cholita was only 10 feet from being outside my view. I pushed my fist into the scene, and it shattered into pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They floated about in the air. The largest chunk fell into my hands. It had turned from a normal twilight scene of Mexico to a pinkish orange glowing chunk the size of a longish broken block of concrete. It was animated with the scene of the village.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita wasn\u2019t in there. I looked at the other pieces floating in the air, hoping she was in one of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they were too jumbled up to investigate thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_de5uc9", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/de5uc9/out_and_about_with_the_dark_scout/f4i9xpl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1571601619.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1571601619.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f4i9o75", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1571601520.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_f4i8y3z", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "First continuation of Part 3\n\nCholita was in such bad shape that she had to get a job to get by, until Carlos decided she could get back into classes.

It seemed like an odd coincidence to me, that Carlos was also involved with art collections.\n\nNext she got a job with Moca Museum under a woman she greatly admired, who\u2019s name Cholita said too fast.

It was going to be tricky because if Cholita woke up and got hold of them, the whole thing would be messed up. She has a tendency to \u201ctake charge\u201d, and get lost on some small detail that would have been handled fine, if she just kept away from the situation.\n\nShe really does seem to behave like Josefina or Zuleica, when they\u2019re at their worst. She even goes into the parrot like voice.\n\nAs part of cleaning, I had to toss out nearly all of my belongings. The rooms involved now belonged to Cholita, and if I didn\u2019t toss them out, she would.\n\nI actually like her system. Nothing is important but what we need next. All the rest has to go. It has no value.\n\nI pretty much ran back and forth between the dumpsters at my business, and home. By 8AM I was already sweating and out of breath.\n\nBut oddly, it was exhilarating. I was in heightened awareness from being silent. As a result, I didn\u2019t feel the usual frustration at small things, like dropping a box of stuff before I got it into the dumpster. Everything just \u201cwas\u201d, and I didn\u2019t mind whatever efforts it took to accomplish the task.\n\nCholita had set the radio station on classical music the night before, and I tend to leave it where she puts it, as a not-doing. As I drove fanatically back and forth hoping to clear out rooms before the cleaning crew arrived, they were playing an excellent trumpet solo, backed by a full orchestra. It had a sad but purposeful sound to it, with a touch of optimism.\n\nThe absurdity of throwing away all my belongings in less than 1 hour, while listening to that amazing trumpet solo hit me, and I realized why the Japanese haze Zen monks.\n\nThe nastiest Zen temple in Japan has only 14 monks these days. It\u2019s a brutal environment with all day menial tasks, very little sleep, tons of meditation, and little food.\n\nThe monks literally have a nervous breakdown, and hopefully all the meditation will give them a safe place to land. Enlightenment.\n\nBut as I realized, you can bypass the Asian hazing and just learn to be silent. That\u2019s their goal also. They just decided to make it more complicated than it needs to be.  If they hadn't, Zen wouldn't have survived.\n\nI barely made it back home from a 4th trash dumping trip, when I found the Brazilian cleaning couple. It was a husband in his 30s, with a wife of similar age, who had an amazing Brazilian butt.\n\nI hadn\u2019t realized it before, but there really is a genetic difference in some Brazilian women. Cholita had indicated a jealousy for that look. Now I could see why.\n\nI carefully explained about Cholita to the cleaning crew, even trying to put a positive spin on it. Since they were from Brazil, I figured they\u2019d know about witches.\n\nI explained that she was an amazing witch, but she was a little mad today. And rude. Very rude.\n\nThey both smiled at me, with understanding.\n\nThen I got out the money for the cleaning, and the woman pulled out her cell phone. She spoke into it in Portuguese. I looked at the translation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t speak any English and only a tiny bit of Spanish. Could you please say that again?\u201d. She held the phone to my mouth.\n\nI tried the witch explanation on the google translate, but I suspect by the way they laughed, it came out as \u201cMy wife is a real Witch!!! She\u2019s very rude, so be careful\u201d.\n\nThey continued laughing as they walked in to begin cleaning.\n\nI looked around. Cholita was not in sight. I checked her little garage exercise studio. The door was closed, and I heard sounds.\n\nI got them started and returned to hauling \u201ctrash\u201d. When I returned, I found Cholita giving commands to the puzzled cleaning crew. They tried to engage her in Spanish, but she said, \u201cNo hablo espanol\u201d.\n\nHer refusal to speak to them in Spanish wasn\u2019t what stuck out in my mind. She was dressed so sexy, you couldn\u2019t even walk out the front door to check the mailbox, without starting a scandal in the neighborhood.\n\nI hadn't seen anything like that before.  My mouth must have dropped into fully opened position. I started to think about whether I might need to join the exercising too, for my health of course.\n\nHer outfit might have been appropriate for exercising alone, but not for ordering servants around.\n\nExcept that, I\u2019d seen that behavior before, with women from Mexico, married to people I knew in the USA.\n\nIt\u2019s a class behavior. As Cholita explains, we have no classes in the USA. I said that was good, and she said, \u201cGood for you maybe.\u201d\n\nMeaning, I also have no class. But Cholita is upper class, the daughter of a powerful government worker.\n\nAnd I\u2019m only guessing here. But showing up very sexy to order around the servants, both lets them know who\u2019s in charge, and also why.\n\nThe Brazilian cleaning woman smiled and said, \u201cYou are so beautiful!\u201d\n\nCholita smiled to acknowledge she\u2019d been treated properly, and gave a short list of what she wanted done. It was only 2 of the cleaning tasks I\u2019d paid for,  out of nearly 30.\n\nShe added, \u201cNothing else! Only that list\u201d.\n\nShe stomped back into the garage. I signaled to the cleaning crew with a thumbs up (they hadn\u2019t understood a word Cholita said), and they got back to work.\n\nAs it turned out, Cholita was very happy with them once she saw the bathtub and stove. She didn\u2019t pay much attention to the rest.\n\nIt took all day to finish cleaning and moving things around. I had to remain in silent mode, to keep from feeling frustrated or put out. Cholita went into her pink bedroom, told them to do nothing in there, and locked the doors.\n\nWhile hauling trash around and trying to make more room at the trash bin in our driveway, I found some very expensive shoes. I recognized expensive shoes because of Cholita.\n\nI went to her room and asked if she really wanted to throw those out. She informed me that they belonged to Margarita, and she was getting rid of the past. I also noticed books by Carlos Castaneda in that trash load. And pictures of Cholita\u2019s doings in her 20s.\n\nCholita regretted the shoes, and said, \u201cGive them to one of your girlfriends!\u201d\n\nI gave them to the cleaning lady saying, they belonged to a famous witch, and would bring her good luck.\n\nShe didn\u2019t understand a word, but was grateful for the shoes. Using her cell phone translator, she told me to thank the lady of the house.\n\nAll in all, Cholita liked that cleaning crew. When they brought in their children to help, because the job was bigger than they thought, a cute 10 year old boy with a video game in his hands took refuge in Cholita\u2019s garden paradise. She\u2019d been accumulating it over the last week. When Cholita saw him laying in her garden lounge chair,  under an LED lit large umbrella, she decided that this Brazilian family had at least a little class.\n\nShe was pleased.\n\nAt 3PM the cleaning crew barely finished and Cholita and I had to leave for the Tensegrity Dome event in Los Angeles, where Cholita was going to watch a 360 degree trippy movie.\n\nShe was in a good mood, so I asked her about her dreaming the night before. She became angry. She reminded me, I was banned from following her around in her dreams.\n\nI tried to explain how important it was to the Castaneda community, to test shared dreaming.\n\nShe didn\u2019t care. Carlos is gone, and my dreaming invasions make her legs hurt so that she can\u2019t sleep.\n\nI tried to confirm if she remembered anything, but that was the end of the conversation, and we were lost on the road anyway.\n\nCholita had the instructions and the address, but wouldn\u2019t trust me to touch her cell phone. Germs bother her.\n\nShe gave me some basic instructions for how to get downtown, then went on to explain how Margarita had brought her to the US to live in her home, and meet Carlos.\n\nShe was allowed to go to a private class or two, but then she wasn\u2019t invited again. Being in the class had caused a rift with her husband, and she was pretty much trapped living with Margarita, who liked to coax her into bed on occasion.\n\nAll this is from Cholita.  I have no firsthand knowledge except for a visit or two to Margarita\u2019s home.\n\nContinued in a comment\n\nEdited", "edited": 1571607779.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f4i8y3z", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 3: A normal day with Cholita&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the day after the beer drinking contest, I had to get up at 7AM to prepare for the cleaning crew Cholita had insisted on.

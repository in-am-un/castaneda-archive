It took a long time before I could be sure she\u2019d show up when called.\n\nBut because of taking care of Cholita, I\u2019ve neglected her too much. She\u2019s gone.\n\nIs there a real creature which got hungry for energy, and went somewhere else?\n\nBeats me.\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter. Everyone should use whatever tools they can, to learn to manipulate the second attention. Give up on the idea that it has to be \u201creal\u201d or \u201cblessed\u201d by Carlos or one of the Cleargreens.\n\nYou don't need to go out and coax a lizard to walk up to your hand, so that you can proceed to sew its eyes shut in order to get an ally from Devil's weed.\n\nJust make your own Ally!\n\nAs don Juan said, sorcerers take their dreams as real.  And Faction #3 certainly takes dreams as real.\n\nMy imaginary fairy has taught me to travel to other worlds as easily as Emilito seems to have done in Carlos\u2019 books.\n\n(Easily = 6 hours of intense effort after at least a week of 2 or more hours a day practice).\n\nShe also taught me to push and pull on entities in her world, how to switch between viewing her as a fairy, and seeing her true form, and just in general she became my best friend.\n\nShe also showed up for me, full sized,  in a see-thru Japanese Sailor suit!\n\nIt was a pleasingly disturbing scene.  I really miss her.\n\nIn the meantime, a flat and lifeless faced inorganic being has taken her place. I might have pulled him from his world by accident.  I dubbed him Zoltar, in honor of Cholita's fondness for the lifeless mechanical fortune teller.\n\nHe\u2019s characterized (my Zoltar, not the machine) by having a little whizzing thing spinning around inside an array of colored lights.\n\nThe fairy had none. Just the dots of color.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to determine the shape of the dots, because when you look directly into them, they project out pieces of reality.\n\nA piece of an ear, a shape, a sensation.\n\nOur awareness seems to bounce off inorganic beings and reflect back what's in our subconscious.\n\nMy little fairy entity taught me to scoop colors from all around. She\u2019d literally fly over to a color, and then I only had to use a tensegrity technique to apply it to my body. See a past post on scooping colors.\n\nZoltar on the other hand is lifeless. He doesn\u2019t \u201cgo\u201d anywhere, he just appears and leaves. And most appearances are faint.\n\nIn trying to figure out if he was my little fairy, I noticed that he likes to hang out high to my right or left. His spinning array of lights is floating up there, if I just get the right position of my body, the correct side, and if I\u2019ve been watching darkness for at least an hour.\n\nBut let me insert a tip on allies for those of you who don't have one yet.\n\nThey don't have to have a 1 to 1 correspondance between the mass of lights they really are, and the image they've projected into your mind.\n\nThey can make a group of people, and they can remain at a distance from the projection.\n\nIf you suspect they aren't \"inside\" their projection, look to the right and up.  You might catch them there.\n\nI noticed that the correct position of the body, for viewing Zoltar in his native form,  is similar to Howard Lee\u2019s \u201cLight of Life\u201d posture, where you greatly but gently bend your back, backwards.\n\nYou lean back, almost like a yoga posture where you curve your back the opposite way it normally curves.\n\nThat redeploys energy from the periphery of the luminous shell, giving you the burst you need to perceive Zoltar.\n\nI tried various tensegrity moves, hoping to find something \"official\" that would do the same thing. I emphasized the curve in the back, and then suddenly remembered something from childhood.\n\nI knew that technique when I was in elementary school!\n\nI\u2019d discovered that when you get up in the morning and yawn and stretch your arms, and if you put one arm up and out at a 45 degree angle, and the other down and 45 in the opposite way, and curve your back sharply, and rotate your head, maybe even the spine a bit, to get a good stretch, you can nearly pass out from the lights that are generated.\n\nI thought the lights were just from moving the eyeballs around during the stretch, but I discovered last night that it both redeploys energy, and also forces the assemblage point to shift.\n\nThe arch in the back literally displaces it. Not much I guess.  But it's pretty easy to pass out while doing it, so it's not a tiny movement.\n\nYou just wouldn't notice the magic effect it produces, because while doing it you're absorbed in the feeling of the stretch.\n\nDoes it produce Zoltar every time?\n\nSort of.  Certainly enough times to get tired of Zoltar for the evening. He's not much fun.\n\nEach time you summon him with that posture, you use up the energy you\u2019ve freed from that position.\n\nAn exact copy of the movement is good for 2 manifestations, but not 3.\n\nBut you can do it a little more extremely.  Stretching more each time.  So you could presumably do it again and again, until something breaks because you stretched too far.\n\nAnd if you go do something else, the energy seems to be restored.  It's like a drinking puddle in some rocks in the path of a natural stream, that's good for 2 gulps, but has a tiny stream of water slowly refilling it.\n\nOne of the long forms seems to have this movement in it, but I can\u2019t recall which. I recall that it even rotates the head, once the stretch position is achieved.  Rotating the head as if to scan all directions the head can in that position,  is part of the movement.  I suspect Carlos also knew it could summon Zoltar-like entities.\n\nIt's also remarkably close to what Carlos called, \"the source\" of Tensegrity.  Don  Juan's back stretching movements.\n\nSomeone asked me a while back if they worked.  I found out they did, but I didn't realize how well.  I especially didn't notice that human beings just naturally do that kind of stretching, when they wake up.\n\nIf Cholita  comes to live with me, maybe I'll get her to pose for pictures of new movements we discover.\n\nBut in the meantime, I\u2019ve found a picture of something close.  And I added something a little like Zoltar, except the lights are too big.  Make them spots, and add a spiny thing in the upper right.  And it should be up about a foot higher.\n\nYes, it's from ***that*** Star Trek episode, where an entity made out of energy fed off the emotions of the crew.  Odd coincidence only.\n\nYou don\u2019t need the leg posture, just the stretch.  In fact, that leg posture would hurt the effect, not help it.  Even better would be to pull the knees up to the chest, but that might make it impossible to stretch enough.\n\nIf you can see colors in the dark (wait until you can), please try out Zoltar\u2019s Pandiculations.  You don't need the leg posture. Just go with what helps keep balance.\n\nI'm lazy, so that's nothing.  I just stand like normal, and hang out near the bed in case I topple over in the darkness.\n\nThis pass can make you pass out, so be careful with it.  Also, try to \"feel the stretch\", the same way people do when yawning and stretching.  Make that feeling, even if you have to rotate your spine or head a little either way.\n\nChances are, you've done this pass before without realizing it.\n\nAfter I discovered this pose, I found Zoltar with a smile on his face.   He was still lifeless, but he was happy.\n\nAnd if you want to know why I call him Zoltar, then the next time you see his fortune telling booth, give him a little money.\n\nHe'll show you.\n\nCholita can't resist Zoltar.  She even saves his fortunes, if she likes them.   She puts them next to her favorite fortune cookie slips of paper, next to her credit cards in her purse.\n\nEdited: five times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Zoltar's Pandiculations", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 82, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"eqdhrbvyvzp31": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 63, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eqdhrbvyvzp31.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cf968b422c1e0f981c1fba8f5f42c9157dcbe8c"}, {"y": 126, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eqdhrbvyvzp31.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9572629b6fdb57c034a096382f8044f9a076b74"}, {"y": 188, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eqdhrbvyvzp31.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22448ad983708e7bc8651c1750ce67cc66912383"}, {"y": 376, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eqdhrbvyvzp31.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1d4dd586048327c1fef22ec36ed8408e6d7e405"}], "s": {"y": 432, "x": 735, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/eqdhrbvyvzp31.jpg?width=735&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ff1617fc67cf9c28ca5528feb3e4843a8b8e0ad"}, "id": "eqdhrbvyvzp31"}}, "name": "t3_dbyvug", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/P94NSmD69fGD2dWk5sonZgMP0CrutRVgKaWQI6n1zYY.jpg", "edited": 1569971235.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1569960066.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/eqdhrbvyvzp31.jpg?width=735&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5ff1617fc67cf9c28ca5528feb3e4843a8b8e0ad\"&gt;Virabhadrasana II (Reverse Warrior Pose)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While searching for my little fairy last night, I couldn\u2019t help but notice there was no way that Zoltar was merely her, in a different form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both are low energy inorganic beings I found on some colored lights in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to groom the fairy.

So NEVER practice it, except when in, or on the verge of heightened awareness.\n\nNot only is there no point to practicing it the way normal tensegrity should be practiced, but you'll likely stretch too far trying to make something happen and you'll be sore in the morning.\n\nI'll make up a new category of Tensegrity:  Active Tensegrity.\n\nIt's only used when you're actually doing something using the second attention.  It's a tool, not an exercise.\n\nThe finger flicking technique would fall into this category also, since until you can see the results,  flicking your fingers will be pointless.\n\nPandiculate gently at first.  If it isn't working, forget about it until you get the colors in the darkness to become brighter.\n\nOnce you get the hang of it, you can just stretch your back a little, and change what's going on.

Normally you probably wouldn't see that at all. I've only seen it when they rest in my hand or on my lap.\n\nAnd the lights are not blurry like that animation.  They are in fact, too much in focus.  So much so that it's not possible, and you know for sure it's from the second attention.\n\nAnd the lights have colors, they aren't all the same.  They're much smaller, and move only slightly so that you'd have to really watch, to see if they were changing positions.\n\nWhile trying to watch them that closely, shapes and forms will propel out at you.  You can't really watch that scene on a sustained basis, unless you are very very silent.\n\nAnd of course, since they're likely just a projection from wherever they come from, who knows if they're actually \"located\" anywhere in particular.\n\nMe being able to reach out my arm and grab one from its own world, indicates whatever is going on isn't really what we think.\n\nSo why I can sometimes see their outer shell when they're sitting on my hand, is beyond me. I doubt they can actually sit anywhere, in our world.\n\nLet's return to the idea that there's \"beliefs\" involved in sorcery.\n\nHopefully not!  That's exactly what we're trying to toss out. All beliefs (internal dialogue).\n\nSo if you perceive something like that, it's just what happens.\n\nThat's all I can report, what happened.  And until we get a lot of reports on the same topic, we won't know if anyone would benefit from learning an inventory of what you \"ought to see\".\n\nOddly, Carlos' allies are entirely different.  They do in fact turn into a beam of light, as he said.  \n\nI haven't seen them make a weak little galaxy so far.\n\nI really do think, there are many different kinds of inorganic beings, and you can play with a \"butterfly\" inorganic being just as well as you can play with the human like ones that Carlos introduced us to.\n\nI prefer the mellow ones, since the best use of all of them is to merely gaze at them, to move your assemblage point.\n\nBeing chased by Carlos' allies is no fun at all, even if you know they can't do anything.\n\nMy latest low energy one, big head, is a pleasure to behold.  So far the only threat she poses is to kiss me.\n\nFor newbees, inorganic beings feed on our energy, and it's not unlike a sexual relationship, in that they attract, and you provide something they wanted.\n\nThey're clueless on how to attract,  but over time they learn.

Normally you probably wouldn&amp;#39;t see that at all. I&amp;#39;ve only seen it when they rest in my hand or on my lap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the lights are not blurry like that animation.  They are in fact, too much in focus.  So much so that it&amp;#39;s not possible, and you know for sure it&amp;#39;s from the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the lights have colors, they aren&amp;#39;t all the same.  They&amp;#39;re much smaller, and move only slightly so that you&amp;#39;d have to really watch, to see if they were changing positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While trying to watch them that closely, shapes and forms will propel out at you.  You can&amp;#39;t really watch that scene on a sustained basis, unless you are very very silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, since they&amp;#39;re likely just a projection from wherever they come from, who knows if they&amp;#39;re actually &amp;quot;located&amp;quot; anywhere in particular.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me being able to reach out my arm and grab one from its own world, indicates whatever is going on isn&amp;#39;t really what we think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why I can sometimes see their outer shell when they&amp;#39;re sitting on my hand, is beyond me. I doubt they can actually sit anywhere, in our world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s return to the idea that there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;beliefs&amp;quot; involved in sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully not!  That&amp;#39;s exactly what we&amp;#39;re trying to toss out. All beliefs (internal dialogue).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you perceive something like that, it&amp;#39;s just what happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I can report, what happened.  And until we get a lot of reports on the same topic, we won&amp;#39;t know if anyone would benefit from learning an inventory of what you &amp;quot;ought to see&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly, Carlos&amp;#39; allies are entirely different.  They do in fact turn into a beam of light, as he said.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t seen them make a weak little galaxy so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really do think, there are many different kinds of inorganic beings, and you can play with a &amp;quot;butterfly&amp;quot; inorganic being just as well as you can play with the human like ones that Carlos introduced us to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I prefer the mellow ones, since the best use of all of them is to merely gaze at them, to move your assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being chased by Carlos&amp;#39; allies is no fun at all, even if you know they can&amp;#39;t do anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My latest low energy one, big head, is a pleasure to behold.  So far the only threat she poses is to kiss me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For newbees, inorganic beings feed on our energy, and it&amp;#39;s not unlike a sexual relationship, in that they attract, and you provide something they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re clueless on how to attract,  but over time they learn. Or your expectations color the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My take on it: Go ahead and accept kissy faces, because it&amp;#39;s better than corpse faces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t mess with them.

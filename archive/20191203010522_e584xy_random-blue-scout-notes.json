They'll call up and say, I know Castaneda is giving a class on Sundays, in Santa Monica. The Blue Scout will say, I knew it! and close us down. She is very powerful, and I walk an energetic tightrope fending her off. Because she could always spin and leave.\"\"She loves to go to Disneyland, because she loves the speed. She'll get on a ride, going very fast, and it can take her away. She drives fast too. So she'll say to me that if I don't want her to stay, just give the word and she'll spin.\" He told us that his group \"got very upset with me for referring to her as a bitch at one of the sessions. I adore her, but she's very tough. She also does mathematics, geometry, calculus (I can hardly add, that's not my thing), and she gets straight A's but she doesn't know how she does it.\"He warned us that \"She knows something's going on. I finished working on the next issue of the Journal, and Nyei and I stayed up all night editing it. The Blue Scout changed things around and offered to print out a clean copy. She told me she was going to bring it by this morning. She called around 9 AM to say it was taking a little longer. At 9:30 AM she was saying she was having formatting problems, so it would be 10 or so. At 10 she blamed it on something else, and said, You're not going anywhere are you?  When she asks things like that in person,\" as he demonstrated with one of us, she would stand an inch or two away and stare into his eyes. Castaneda responded \"No.\" Finally she showed up at his house at 1 PM (obviously, he indicated, to see if he was still there, or was leaving for class). He told us that was why he had been late to the class (showing up about 1:20 PM, instead of 1:00 sharp as usual).\n\nJanuary 26-28, 1996 - Mexico City Workshop in large ballroom at Centro Asturiano in Chapultapec Park. Castaneda lectured Friday night, Saturday morning and Saturday night. Castaneda was asked, in Spanish, \"What's for sure about the Blue Scout?\" He responded that it was \"my fault\" that she entered don Juan's world, because don Juan always told him not to hang out in the inorganics\u00a1\u00af realm, but he went, and saw the Blue Scout there \"as a 7-year-old child that looked a lot like my father.\" She said \"help me,\" and he gave all his energy so she could leave. The inorganics had trapped the Blue Scout for exploring. \"Carol Tiggs brought her to life. She's now the daughter of Carol Tiggs. This girl is our epicenter! She can do many things, but otherwise is normal . . . almost . . . The appearance of this explorer is confirmation of the extinction of don Juan's lineage.\"\n\nFebruary 4, 1996 \u00a8C Sunday session with Castaneda.\n\nCastaneda ended the session by claiming that when the Blue Scout was trapped in the inorganics world, she was in a position similar to human beings who are trapped here until we die. \" She has this longing, which isn't a nostalgic kind of longing, but a longing to be traveling and to lose herself voyaging out there. We came from somewhere, and we should continue the journey. The Blue Scout just so much wants to go off.\"\n\nMarch 1-3, 1996 - Women-only workshop on \"The Female Energy Body,\" at UCLA. Carol, Taisha, Florinda, Castaneda and Nury all spoke.Nury read two chapters from Castaneda's upcoming \"Memorable Events\" book. In introducing herself, Nury commented, \"My parents told me that I came from a far-away galaxy. However, I myself am not preoccupied with that.\" Nury gave her name, part of which was \"Nuli.\" Then she talked about two kinds of love--love based on the social order and the kind of love that sorcerers know. She also talked about the sorcerer's path as being one of solitariness (not to be confused with loneliness). Passes supposedly given to the Witches and Nury by the members of don Juan's party were taught at this workshop.\n\nEdited: once", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Random Blue Scout Notes", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_e584xy", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1575334001.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1575331522.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 96 or 97, the Blue Scout painted an image of &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot; (a &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; technique), and the middle of it was assembling a new world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to get my hands on that poster!

And the wrong idea is kind of absurd, so I'll clear that up.\n\nIt's not that he's watching, see's broccoli, and decides he hates the stuff.  And so you don't get to perceive the broccoli.\n\nBut when a nice burger comes along, he's fine with that.\n\nAs long as it's not from Chic-fil-a.   He's angry with them for some vague reason.\n\nIt's not like that.\n\nIt's more like, the universe consists of amorphous undifferentiated energy.

On the 3rd, it slid 4 inches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s manifested her entire second attention energy body, in daylight, so that I could see it clear as anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She walks into my room in her dreaming body at night, while I&amp;#39;m awake with eyes open, just watching the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same thing that happened to Carlos in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d want to ditch apprentices who pretty much despise you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly, Cholita does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, they have super powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are kind of hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita had plans today to make some kind of witchcraft tool, but canceled because she wasn&amp;#39;t feeling well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to visit her just now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was catatonic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But kind of hot, if I&amp;#39;m allowed to say so.  She got all dolled up first, then went catatonic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since she didn&amp;#39;t know I was coming to visit that time of day, I have to guess that&amp;#39;s her normal routine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can smell the house from the next block.  Perfume, incense, and sage smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the parking lot I found a smashed up large clay pot. It was obviously hurled at the pavement with tremendous force, so that it shattered into mostly powder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next to it was a screen door that she&amp;#39;d kicked in over and over, until she finally yanked it off the hinges and put it by the garbage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: The smashed clay pot was present in 3 locations, all equidistant from the center of the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Teh main chards were placed carefully in a junky couch a neighbor has carelessly left on his sidewalk for a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I presume it was all a spell of some kind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a small hole dug in the lawn towards the center. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t look inside.  Cholita destroyed our toilet.

But the \"little girl\" \\[the Blue Scout\\] and \"the big girl\" \\[Carol\\] are \"just amazing.\" He told us that he had watched Carol \"fussing over\" the Blue Scout, wiping her face, and that because they are each so strong, independent and capable, \"this kind of tenderness\" between them just broke him up.Later, Talia, Kylie and others distributed to each of us one of the leather paperweights they had created, inspired by a paperweight that the Blue Scout had found that they had agreed was \"the perfect weight and nature to induce silence.\"\n\nJuly 1, 1996 \u00a8C Cleargreen, Inc., files its required annual \"Statement by Domestic Stock Corporation,\" listing \"Nuri\" Alexander as one of the corporation's directors, along with Muni Aranha and Talia Bey.\n\nJuly 20-25, 1996 - Intensive Tensegrity Workshop at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion at which Castaneda, the three Witches and \"Marie Alexander\" (the Blue Scout) all spoke.Nury performed a \"snake\" long form with Zaia, both of them wearing skin tight outfits, black gloves with silver thimble tips and wrap-around sunglasses. During the course of the workshop, Nury (then \"Marie\") also read two chapters from Castaneda's manuscript that became *The Active Side of Infinity*: first a chapter about one of Castaneda's professors (in the book, \"Professor Lorca\"); and the second about Castaneda's preparing to jump from the mesa immediately prior to don Juan's departure, and the three people whose valuable life lessons he needed first to review and acknowledge.After a lunch break, on the second or third day, Nury briefly took the stage to deliver a blistering attack in response to a few people who had apparently come up between sessions and pestered her with questions about what it was like to come from another galaxy or another dimension. Her essential message was \"Deal with your own shit!\" She also stated, rather convincingly, that her lack of memory about her life prior to Castaneda's freeing her from the inorganic's world had to do with the fact that memory depended to a large degree on one's physicality.

Thus, any memory she could muster would have to be somehow converted to one that we--and now she--could understand within our \"bi-pedal\" experience.

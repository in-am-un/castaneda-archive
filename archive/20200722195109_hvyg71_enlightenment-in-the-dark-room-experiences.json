They just mess around with their friends.\n\nHere's that dark room experience:\n\nLast night while practicing, after trying to maintain quietness for a long time I felt an actual tingle starting from the top of my head all the way down my spine! It just came out of nowhere, and I had felt very tired before. As it came, everything changed. I don't think I can explain it exactly, but I will try. It felt like my vision shifted. I wasn't just looking around in the dark, but my eyes felt BIG and were open really \"wide\", like my perception wasn't only from my eyes, but from my whole head? Or not even my head, but somewhere over/behind that. I noticed I didn't need to blink, for a very long time (as long as this whole thing lasted). I could see without really moving my eyes or head. There was so many things to see that I don't have the vocabulary to explain. Many colors, even read dots. Huge yellow \"clouds\". Fast purple blobs and blackness following them. My physical feeling changed completely, I didn't feel tired at all anymore, more like resting but extremely aware and awake. I was breathing deep breaths and every breath I took felt so good, like I was breathing into some ecstasy. That's how it felt, ecstatic. Very comfortable and ecstatic, like my heart bursting out of happiness! Every deep breath just increased this.  I felt like sinking into the \"darkness\", that was full of things, without my body but in my body. The whole thing felt so damn good, and now I can see how it literally is not up to me if I am going to have success one night or not, it isn't a part of me or my decisions at all. This kind of happiness was like being drunk, but without the dizziness and lost of clear mind- it was like I was there in my mind but I wasn't. I didn't have a vocabulary internal dialogue when this happened, but I did have a melody on my mind (a song by yellow magic orchestra) and it didn't stop the feeling from coming, and I can't really understand how many levels there are of internal dialogue, bc sometimes I have melodies playing in my mind and the \"normal\" internal dialogue going on too.\n\nI don't really know the exact time this whole thing lasted, time didn't matter, but at the end of practicing when I went to bed I checked the time and I had been practicing for about 4 hours, which is the most I've done this far.\n\nEdited", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Enlightenment in the dark (room experiences)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 100, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"xvev1a6g4gc51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 77, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xvev1a6g4gc51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eea0b5354f0da023468e480379203549b0a9fe9f"}, {"y": 155, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xvev1a6g4gc51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d352b965a48a779606963ce2cddf86c67988d16"}, {"y": 229, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xvev1a6g4gc51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8829a389d2c9116f0b6a9e87b9b4fe42893204a6"}, {"y": 459, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xvev1a6g4gc51.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba8a5caa36bb09b6f5940d0c9211f11e16b90dd1"}], "s": {"y": 533, "x": 742, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xvev1a6g4gc51.jpg?width=742&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1899d1c213dd2599a3872f597df8ecead5d40e6"}, "id": "xvev1a6g4gc51"}}, "name": "t3_hvyg71", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/IkHaF9ldpPVB8FIwi1Id16-z8ulwOavMWBCgOm4Vjug.jpg", "edited": 1595446646.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1595440269.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xvev1a6g4gc51.jpg?width=742&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d1899d1c213dd2599a3872f597df8ecead5d40e6\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/xvev1a6g4gc51.jpg?width=742&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d1899d1c213dd2599a3872f597df8ecead5d40e6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone from here who doesn&amp;#39;t post personal experiences, gave me permission to do it for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially, they &amp;quot;reached enlightenment&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oops...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d better watch out for the meditation police!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s sacrilege!

It may exceed your practice time for the day, in which case just go as far as you can and remember that the struggle produces more benefits than the successes.\n\nAlso, when you get there,  you'll know it.\n\nYou haven't gotten there, just because you're surrounded by magic everywhere.\n\nYou get there when you have total understanding, calmness, and magic seems obvious.\n\nIf you're still wondering, \"Is this all there is?\", you haven't gotten there.\n\nWe're used to believing the influence of the things around us controls our mood.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nIt controls our internal dialogues, which cause our assemblage point to micro-shift.\n\nOur assemblage point controls our moods. And all that we are.\n\nRemember Carlos turning into a crow?  Don Juan told him to visualize his beak forming, and  wings coming out, and his little feet sprouting.\n\nThe little Smoke had pushed his assemblage point into the red zone of the J curve, and don Juan was teaching him how to micro-shift it there.\n\nYou guys can do the same down there, once you figure out how to hold it at that depth.\n\nBut the same thing happens during practice, if you come under \"attack\" as Carlos put it, when his doctor decided to marry one of the Canadians and lied about it.\n\nIf you have to ask what the attack really was, keep learning to get silent. It's very obvious then.\n\nSilence is a tricky thing.  You really don't have it, until you can observe it.\n\nCarlos said in class there we 2 kinds, and that confused everyone.\n\nOdd.  There should have already been some who could understand that statement.\n\nIt means, the kind you get with brute force, or by trickery from observing the second attention with gazing, is not internal silence.\n\nIt's removal of the internal dialogue.\n\nNot the same at all, but one leads to the other.\n\nAny reduction in the internal dialogue will produce cool effects, like colors.\n\nBut until you are \"sitting on the shelf of silence\", you haven't gotten silent.\n\nThat means, until you can sort of \"look down\" a few inches, and see a smooth surface of absolute silence, with no strain to keep it, you haven't gotten there.\n\nAnd the colors will not be super bright.\n\nOnce you can view your silence without strain, and not wonder if you are silent, but see it visually,  then you need to locate the thing that interprets stuff.\n\nDon't \"recognize\" anything anymore.\n\nJust sort of use peripheral vision to observe all the magic floating in the air, from being at that level of silence.\n\nDon't look for things to \"recognize\", or judge, or like, or dislike.\n\nThat's the bottom most level of the internal dialogue that I've been able to detect.

It may exceed your practice time for the day, in which case just go as far as you can and remember that the struggle produces more benefits than the successes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, when you get there,  you&amp;#39;ll know it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You haven&amp;#39;t gotten there, just because you&amp;#39;re surrounded by magic everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get there when you have total understanding, calmness, and magic seems obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re still wondering, &amp;quot;Is this all there is?&amp;quot;, you haven&amp;#39;t gotten there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re used to believing the influence of the things around us controls our mood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It controls our internal dialogues, which cause our assemblage point to micro-shift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our assemblage point controls our moods. And all that we are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember Carlos turning into a crow?  Don Juan told him to visualize his beak forming, and  wings coming out, and his little feet sprouting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little Smoke had pushed his assemblage point into the red zone of the J curve, and don Juan was teaching him how to micro-shift it there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You guys can do the same down there, once you figure out how to hold it at that depth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the same thing happens during practice, if you come under &amp;quot;attack&amp;quot; as Carlos put it, when his doctor decided to marry one of the Canadians and lied about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have to ask what the attack really was, keep learning to get silent. It&amp;#39;s very obvious then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence is a tricky thing.  You really don&amp;#39;t have it, until you can observe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos said in class there we 2 kinds, and that confused everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Odd.  There should have already been some who could understand that statement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It means, the kind you get with brute force, or by trickery from observing the second attention with gazing, is not internal silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s removal of the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the same at all, but one leads to the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any reduction in the internal dialogue will produce cool effects, like colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But until you are &amp;quot;sitting on the shelf of silence&amp;quot;, you haven&amp;#39;t gotten silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means, until you can sort of &amp;quot;look down&amp;quot; a few inches, and see a smooth surface of absolute silence, with no strain to keep it, you haven&amp;#39;t gotten there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the colors will not be super bright.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you can view your silence without strain, and not wonder if you are silent, but see it visually,  then you need to locate the thing that interprets stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;recognize&amp;quot; anything anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just sort of use peripheral vision to observe all the magic floating in the air, from being at that level of silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t look for things to &amp;quot;recognize&amp;quot;, or judge, or like, or dislike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the bottom most level of the internal dialogue that I&amp;#39;ve been able to detect. I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s yet another down there, but if you get this far, you&amp;#39;ll be pleased.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get rid of that need to judge and interpret everything, the colors and magic in the air will be very pleasing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll stop looking for things. Stop trying to do something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be facing infinity, and if there&amp;#39;s real energy out there at a distance,  you might catch a glimpse of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until that point, you&amp;#39;re sort of nearsighted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Staring at the inside of your own bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you aren&amp;#39;t nearsighted anymore, you can go back to advanced puffery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot more going on there than you saw at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to find different things, like puffs made from cobwebs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or lights emanating from your hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See if the hands push the colors around differently than the arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See if some patches are hot, and some cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See if some have cobwebs in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to find the tentacles around your

His face revealed a peculiar mood; he seemed to be unusually serious. I did not know what to ask or to say. He proceeded:\n\"The particular thing to learn is how to get to the crack between the worlds and how to enter the other world. There is a crack between the two worlds, the world of the diableros and the world of living men. There is a place where the two worlds overlap. The crack is there. It opens and closes like a door in the wind. To get there a man must exercise his will. He must, I should say, develop an indomitable desire for it, a single-minded dedication. But he must do it without the help of any power or any man. The man by himself must ponder and wish up to a moment in which his body is ready to undergo the journey. That moment is announced by prolonged shaking of the limbs and violent vomiting. The man usually cannot sleep or eat, and wanes away. When the convulsions do not stop the man is ready to go, and the crack between the worlds appears right in front of his eyes, like a monumental door, a crack that goes up and down. When the crack opens the man has to slide through it. It is hard to see on the other side of the boundary. It is windy, like a sandstorm. The wind whirls around. The man then must walk in any direction. It will be a short or a long journey, depending on his willpower. A strong-willed man journeys shortly. An undecided, weak man journeys long and precariously. After this journey the man arrives at a sort of plateau. It is possible to distinguish some of its features clearly. It is a plane above the ground.\n\nIt is possible to recognize it by the wind, which there becomes even more violent, whipping, roaring all around. On top of that plateau is the entrance to that other world. And there stands a skin that separates the two worlds; dead men go through it without a noise, but we have to break it with an outcry. The wind gathers strength, the same unruly wind that blows on the plateau. When the wind has gathered enough force, the man has to yell and the wind will push him through. Here his will has to be inflexible, too, so that he can fight the wind. All he needs is a gentle shove; he does not need to be blown to the ends of the other world. Once on the other side, the man will have to wander around. His good fortune would be to find a helper nearby - not too far from the entrance. The man has to ask him for help. In his own words he has to ask the helper to teach him and make him a diablero. When the helper agrees, he kills the man on the spot, and while he is dead he teaches him. When you make the trip yourself, depending on your luck, you may find a great diablero in the helper who will kill you and teach you. Most of the time, though, one encounters lesser brujos who have very little to teach. But neither you nor they have the power to refuse. The best instance is to find a male helper lest one become the prey of a diablera, who will make one suffer in an unbelievable manner. Women are always like that. But that depends on luck alone, unless one's benefactor is a great diablero himself, in which event he will have many helpers in the other world, and can direct one to see a particular helper. My benefactor was such a man. He directed me to encounter his spirit helper. After your return, you will not be the same man. You are committed to come back to see your helper often. And you are committed to wander farther and farther from the entrance, until finally one day you will go too far and will not be able to return.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g00lt9y", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;excerpt from first book (TODJ) about iobs and iob-like-old-sorcerers, long before jump. &amp;quot;dead&amp;quot; may refer to entering second attention here, and recall Carlos has indeed seemingly &amp;quot;died&amp;quot; deep in second attention (multiple times?) and then recovered by Silvio Manuel, Don Juan and others &amp;quot;breathing&amp;quot; him back to life, returning first attention, similar to explanation here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you think I could get a helper?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;To know that, you have to learn much more.

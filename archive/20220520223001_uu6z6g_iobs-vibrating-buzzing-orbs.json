that is trying to get through a window, eventually it makes its way back in and I have to keep playing this tug of war game with it, that way, I\u2019ve had this IOB on me for months now and I\u2019ve been reading as much material as I can about IOBs and Sorcery, and practicing whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it tends to manipulate my assemblage point, I think, with the help of my reactions to how it behaved in the past (before it wouldn\u2019t stick onto me for as long as it does now, it would fly around, above the heads of people that I live with and myself switching, until one day I decided to try to manipulate the movement of it with my second attention into a TV monitor to avoid the hovering above people and it worked).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found I was able to control the movement of it for a while before it escaped (due to my stagnation in creating/playing around with it like I\u2019m doing now) and began to switch between people according to a negative thought form aka fear of it hovering above people, it listened to my fear and kept hovering above those that I didnt want it to hover above because at the time I thought it was some government satellite (which affected intent and thought), now I see that its too precise to be that and it would be a silly presumption, it affects physics, reality and perception in general according to my own thought forms and intent (sometimes it helps but I dont have a stable control over it), it also possesses TVs according to thought forms at the time of usage and I\u2019ve created its own system in response to intent accidentally and without realising that makes it induce paranoia when in fact it is a product of previous intent and perception according to poor sources of information, (I am now

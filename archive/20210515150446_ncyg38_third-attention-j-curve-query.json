You avoid getting bogged down at the red line the way Julian did, because you need to practice moving it all the way along the curve.\n\nThen you sweep it across the entire J curve in an instant, and it lights up all of the emanations at the same time.\n\nThat's the 3rd attention.\n\nI've felt the results of a super fast movement, and what don Juan explained is true.  You can light up more emanations than normal, because they tend to keep glowing for a bit after the assemblage point moves away. If you move it the entire way in a second, they're all still glowing.\n\nFor a beginner, it takes 3 hours to move it that far.  If they can keep silent that long.\n\nThere's some argument on whether you have to learn to extend it backwards too, beyond the normal boundaries of the \"egg\",  so that you \"get a running start\" moving it along the part shown there.  That's why the J curve diagram shows an arrow going up, the opposite direction (off the page).\n\nBut that knowledge comes with \"Silent Knowledge\", which happens when you get to the deep orange zone.\n\nBy the way, people who are interested in the \"bad ass\" topics form the books, never seem to put in the time to learn.\n\nThey have some other motivation than learning sorcery.\n\nAn analogy:\n\nI have to cook.  I have so many food sensitivities, I can't even eat at a restaurant.\n\nI get flown all over, to consult with companies.  I always have to tell them, don't try to feed me.\n\nForget lunch or dinner,  or I won't come.\n\nBut even though I'm forced to cook all of my own food, I love cooking.\n\nAs a science.\n\nI like all of the details, and in particular, understanding the \"why\".\n\nRight now I'm testing if 53% flour is better than 54% flour in a Pullman pan using a specific brand of gluten free flour.\n\nCan't eat all the bread.  I make too much of it in order to learn more. I give most to the crows.\n\nSo I have a genuine interest in cooking.\n\nI can easily tell when someone else does, because we end up nerding out with stuff we've learned.\n\nWhen someone asks questions about how profitable a bakery is, or what's the best fast food franchise, and has no interest in cooking secrets, I know they don't like cooking.\n\nThey have other motivations.\n\nSo here's a question:  If the 3rd attention was a lie, would you still want to learn what you see in here?\n\nIf not, you're wasting your time in this subreddit.\n\nBut the good news is, Carlos taught us the J curve, because he was dying.

You avoid getting bogged down at the red line the way Julian did, because you need to practice moving it all the way along the curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you sweep it across the entire J curve in an instant, and it lights up all of the emanations at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the 3rd attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve felt the results of a super fast movement, and what don Juan explained is true.  You can light up more emanations than normal, because they tend to keep glowing for a bit after the assemblage point moves away. If you move it the entire way in a second, they&amp;#39;re all still glowing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a beginner, it takes 3 hours to move it that far.  If they can keep silent that long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s some argument on whether you have to learn to extend it backwards too, beyond the normal boundaries of the &amp;quot;egg&amp;quot;,  so that you &amp;quot;get a running start&amp;quot; moving it along the part shown there.  That&amp;#39;s why the J curve diagram shows an arrow going up, the opposite direction (off the page).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that knowledge comes with &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;, which happens when you get to the deep orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, people who are interested in the &amp;quot;bad ass&amp;quot; topics form the books, never seem to put in the time to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have some other motivation than learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An analogy:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to cook.  I have so many food sensitivities, I can&amp;#39;t even eat at a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get flown all over, to consult with companies.  I always have to tell them, don&amp;#39;t try to feed me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forget lunch or dinner,  or I won&amp;#39;t come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even though I&amp;#39;m forced to cook all of my own food, I love cooking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like all of the details, and in particular, understanding the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now I&amp;#39;m testing if 53% flour is better than 54% flour in a Pullman pan using a specific brand of gluten free flour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t eat all the bread.

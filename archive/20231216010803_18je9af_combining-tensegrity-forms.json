If you actually followed the instructions.\n\nNo one has the discipline to make that work.  And since it's 10 times harder than other available paths, no one would want to unless they were just pretending.\n\nBut at some point, virtually **all** of your dreams come from silence.\n\nBecause you're mostly always silent.\n\nSo that the real purpose of art of dreaming was to show us you can recycle the lost dreaming time, which begins to dominate your awareness when you reach silent knowledge daily.\n\nYou spend more time in magical dreaming (\"real\" dreaming) than you do practicing whatever you are using to reach silent knowledge.\n\nSo you end up with 30 minutes of actual sorcery practice.  And you can get to Silent Knowledge that way!\n\nBut then during the night, you have 6 continuous hours of magic going on in dreaming worlds.\n\nWhich is no longer like ordinary dreams.\n\nAnd which eventually merges with your waking world, in some impossible to describe way.\n\nGenaro looking melancholy when don Juan mentioned that even don Genaro didn't know what his double was doing at this moment, kind of sums it up.\n\nIt's like having a super powerful twin who's hardly ever around.\n\nOr a bad ass cool older brother you never get to hang out with.\n\nNaturally you'd like to learn how to tag along with it.", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kdw3unn", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cool!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We love different colored puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over time, we might get several who see them the same way you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;There&amp;#39;s the whitish static during the daytime. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe you could classify whitish static as &amp;quot;eye junk&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We get new people who see it.

Other dreams had there were whitish puffs which seemed to be real, or any dreams where was focusing on the colors or tinnitus while going to sleep. Had a dream where the IOBs were xenomorphs. Carlos said any silence-derived dream was real. Thought plan to find my hands, starting tonight, forever. Will be doing the foot / ankle / shins / knees / calves / hips tensegrity, then genitals, then buttocks, then heart, then life saver pass, stellar hatch, assemblage point loosening, dreaming tensegrity, the four short rolls and four long rolls, Zuleica&amp;#39;s pass, and Pandora&amp;#39;s Box.

Rules if you like.\n\nEach one mandatory, or nothing happens.\n\n\\#1 is that you *INTEND* to learn to manipulate reality.\n\nBut you can't be intending to be famous. Or write a book. Make a Youtube interview. Or to get closer to your \"soul mate\".\n\nYou REALLY have to \"intend\" to learn sorcery,  just for yourself. Which is our form is manipulation of reality.\n\nSecond is that you need a technique which has been practiced in the past, for the same purpose.\n\nThat's the tensegrity.  Some parts go back thousands of years.\n\nAnd so they contain a \"pull\" to similar realities formed by others using that movement, in the past.\n\nThe pull of their awareness in those alternate realities makes it easier for you to tune those in.\n\nThey're like a stronger radio signal in the desert, because you're passing an area which has a little radio transmitter tower.\n\nNo signal, no alternate realities. Just noise.\n\n(sort of).\n\nThe third thing is you need something to perceive, to pull you the right direction.\n\nWe use the puffs, but you can use sound too.\n\nCholita uses smell a lot.  I gave her a stack of cash as an experiment to see what she'd do these days (after 3 or 4 years believing I had kidnapped her) if she had enough money to run away for a while, and it seems she spent some of it on very expensive smelly stuff.  \n\nThe bathroom smelled like real blood oranges this morning. Not like some imitation scent.  That was likely a pure extraction of the real thing (I make extracts too).\n\nBut the classic example of using sound to alter reality would be the gait of power.\n\nDon Genaro and Carlos marched around in circles doing this magical pass, until they literally walked into hell.\n\nVisually!  Fully awake, eyes wide open, completely sober, they marched into \"hell\".\n\nLater don Juan commented it wasn't so much the tensegrity movements, which clearly stir energy from below raising it up, so as to lure the double to come take a look.\n\nBut it was more the sound of the feet tapping.\n\nAnd that implies the 4th \"hidden\" element.\n\nCarlos could get silent.\n\nThe sound could not have pulled him into a different reality, if he was thinking to himself.\n\nThat's the part our entire community had forgotten in the past.\n\nSo out of those 4 elements, they'd ignore everything but the attention seeking gait of power.\n\nAnd some claimed they went plodding all over the desert, as if that meant they had practiced sorcery seriously.  They'd use that to brag in discussion groups or in interviews.\n\nWhen that never worked for anyone.\n\nAnd yet, that gait of power \"plod your way into hell\" is fully available to all who do darkroom.\n\nIt's the same thing, but in daylight.

Or write a book. Make a Youtube interview. Or to get closer to your &amp;quot;soul mate&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You REALLY have to &amp;quot;intend&amp;quot; to learn sorcery,  just for yourself. Which is our form is manipulation of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second is that you need a technique which has been practiced in the past, for the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the tensegrity.  Some parts go back thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so they contain a &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; to similar realities formed by others using that movement, in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pull of their awareness in those alternate realities makes it easier for you to tune those in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re like a stronger radio signal in the desert, because you&amp;#39;re passing an area which has a little radio transmitter tower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No signal, no alternate realities. Just noise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(sort of).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The third thing is you need something to perceive, to pull you the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We use the puffs, but you can use sound too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita uses smell a lot.  I gave her a stack of cash as an experiment to see what she&amp;#39;d do these days (after 3 or 4 years believing I had kidnapped her) if she had enough money to run away for a while, and it seems she spent some of it on very expensive smelly stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bathroom smelled like real blood oranges this morning. Not like some imitation scent.  That was likely a pure extraction of the real thing (I make extracts too).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the classic example of using sound to alter reality would be the gait of power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Genaro and Carlos marched around in circles doing this magical pass, until they literally walked into hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Visually!

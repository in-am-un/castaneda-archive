Pity...](https://preview.redd.it/wpwcy6e5kxh61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5da89b1445f251c1bb603816b01560c54efa7ecd)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon Juan liked to analyze different types of people and behavior, in order to take the emotional content out of running into them.\n\nThe goal of course, is to be like an empty tube to infinity.\n\nUnfortunately, that goal is a lifetime away.\n\nIn the meantime, if you can look at bad behavior and categorize it, you can attempt to treat it without being offended.\n\nI believe he used the analogy of an angry dog.  You don't get down on the ground when an angry dog is barking at you through a fence, and try to explain to it how offensive its behavior is.\n\nIt's just a bad dog, that's all.  Might become good some day, but who cares anyway?\n\nIf you are new here, you'll misunderstand the purpose of this.\n\nYou're used to religions and belief systems.  Most want you to pretend to be \"holy\", or better than everyone else.  And so on  hearing that you can rub up against bad people and be unaffected, you will surely misunderstand.\n\nYou'll be picturing \"pious\" people, lording it over others because they are \"superior\".\n\nAnd never lose their cool.  But that's the opposite of what you need!\n\nMaybe you'll think, \"Humble\".  But we had 23 years of impeccable humble warriors running around, pretending to be learning Castaneda's sorcery.\n\nAnd they only became bigger idiots.\n\nThe misunderstanding will be based on a total lack of knowledge of  how reality works.  But you'll have to learn sorcery to understand that.\n\nThink of sorcery as \"technology\", not a belief system.  It's a technology to summon spirits and learn from them.\n\nYou don't expect your computer repair guy to be a saint. Maybe he yells at his wife!  But if he can fix the computer, he's a good computer repair man.\n\nLikewise, if you can do real magic, you're a good sorcerer.  Even if you are not a very nice person.\n\nWithout that ability, we suffer endlessly.  Humans need magic!  But they've been taught that it does not exist.\n\nIt's almost as if we are standing in a tub of ice water,  holding a hot potato in our left hand, and pretending everything is fine.\n\nPretending we can overcome the obvious, just because of our powerful mind.\n\nDoing that all the time is bound to make people angry.  Which explains the end game of the  attacks in here.\n\nBut let's put this in more practical terms.\n\nYou work very hard, hours a day, slaving away week after week, while everyone around you tells you that it's nuts, and you've gone off the deep end.\n\nThen, eventually you **do** go off the deep end!  You end up with a little spirit friend.\n\nA 4 inch tall Fairy who will fly around your dark room for you, smiling.\n\nYou can say what you like, think what you like, but in the end, she either flies around the room smiling, or something else happens.\n\nAnd when you rub up against a bad player, she won't.\n\nDon't ask me why.  I don't care why. She just doesn't.\n\nSo you need to learn how to deal with the bad players, in  a manner which only modifies her smile.\n\nBut she still flies around the room for you.\n\nAnd the key to that is, treating bad players the same way you treat a dangerous beast. Just get out of the way.  Don't be offended, because that only harms you.\n\nWe have don Juan's types of petty tyrants to draw from, if we wanted to create a new category of bad players.  And we have the basic personality types of people.  Puke, Piss, Fart.\n\nThat list might not be complete.  If interested, get the searchable pdf.  I shudder to think what you'll find, searching for \"fart\".  Lots of don Genaro I suspect.\n\nPetty tyrants as I recall,  include those who oppress with sadness, and those who oppress with violence. Can't remember more types at this point.    But when you run into them in the real world, it stimulates the memory.\n\nNaturally, with a bad player in here you'll see those types.\n\nBut it's possible to analyze it further, to spot them more quickly.\n\nHere's some quick ways to get clued in\n\n1. They come here and have no interest in practicing, but lots of interest in posting.  The posts are all somehow oddly self-promoting, without any actual information that would help someone learn sorcery.  Let's face it!  The world of Castaneda was dead until recently. No magic, no supernatural goings on.  It was all pretending.  If someone comes in here and doesn't exclaim in some way, \"Oh my God, you mean it all works???\", something is seriously wrong.  What's wrong is clear. They don't care if it works.  That's not what they are after.  It's even possible they assume the whole thing is a fraud, and so who are you to criticize their version of the fraud?\n2. They have posturing user IDs, or sign their name on posts with something designed to make them sound powerful.  Trigger words seem to be \"nagual\", \"Toltec\", \"brujo\", and all the usual suspects used on web pages to attract traffic.  You have to keep in mind, these are sad people.   You don't go around posturing with nothing to back it up, unless you are hurting in your normal persona.\n3. Their user ID has no  history.  Of course this isn't an indicator, but it's good to verify if it's possible they often go around being a troll, and don't want you to see that.\n4. They claim to be a \"good guy\", only interested in helping the community.  This is in fact mostly an obsession with other people.  Someone who hasn't actually learned any sorcery is incapable of helping the community. Or anyone else, according to don Juan. Truth is, without magic in your life, real magic in your face, you are a petty confused and angry person trying to gain the favor of other angry confused people.\n5. It's a woman who asks a lot of lifestyle related questions, but never takes an interest in practicing.  This person is likely looking for a \"soul mate\". Careful. These are tricky and it can take a long time to realize you are wasting your time to try to teach them. If they start discussing other teachings, as if those are alternatives,  don't waste your time with them.\n6. They have a heavy interest in power plants.  While this isn't by itself a problem, if the person also seems mentally ill, it's certainly a sign that they are not going to learn for real and become helpful to restoring the reputation of Carlos. In fact, they will damage it.  The #1 search result on google is probably still from a bogus magazine article saying something like, \"The Drugs were Real, but the rest was not\".  That from interviewing former private class students, on whom Carlos spent years and years.\n7. They have  a relative who is a \"sorcerer\", and seem to believe this gives them some authority.  Truth is, believing that a sorcerer relative gives them authority shows a complete lack of sorcery knowledge.  You can't \"absorb\" sorcery from a relative, and especially not since their relative is certainly another bad player.  They will merely be a more \"entitled\" bad player.\n8. They manage to announce, \"I can \\*see\\*\", possibly in group chat.  No one asked. They just wanted you to know that.  I run into it on Facebook too. I'll see someone who has a reasonable don Juan content to their Facebook, nothing excessive.  I mention this place, they take a look and say, \"Nice. But I can already \\*see\\*.\"   If they never end up over here, bullying others for attention, I'd say this is just someone who all along only had a casual interest, and decided to just forget the whole thing and declare victory.  But they still like their friends to think of them as \"magical\".\n\nContinued when I think of more...\n\nHere's some proposed \"types\" of bad players.\n\n1 ) Ulterior motive.  These people talk as if they understand everything posted, praise people, and generally post stuff that helps no one, serving to only promote themselves as being willing to participate.   You'll be surprised when they first show up, thinking maybe this is a lone wolf sorcerer who found his way here, and actually does understand all the things they seem to.\n\nBut they do not.  And they'll show no actual interest in learning. Their interest is to promote or sell something else, when they get a chance.  Promoting something else doesn't necessarily mean it's for sale. It could simply be the fantasy they've been living off for years, instead of practicing sorcery, and they want to enforce that this is the true path in order to make themselves feel better while pretending.  I guess it's like a man who wears clown pants all the time, showing up to a group and asking, \"Clown pants are cool, right???\"\n\nThese come in many forms, from small fry guy with an obsession on Chinese philosophy as key to understanding, but it could escalate all the way to someone selling a cell phone ap that doesn't actually do anything helpful.  Or even someone promoting a useless parasite guru out there because he has an interest in both topics, and has never actually learned to do any magic.\n\nBest way to spot these is by the beginner mistakes they make, in understanding sorcery terms and concepts. For instance, mistaking \"dark energy\", for some sort of blissful feeling that comes with light, during meditation.\n\nOr they'll say something that's actually funny for how poorly  they understand it.  Such as mistaking, \"Assembling another world\", for organizing your witchcraft supplies.\n\nThe misunderstandings are usually designed to make themselves feel more powerful or successful on whatever path they are actually on.\n\n2) The leader.  These people want others to give them praise and attention.  They often have web pages or social media where they do absolutely nothing to help people actually learn, as evidenced by nothing going on there for decades.  And yet, they pretend to be helpful.  What they really want is a reputation as the top of the heap in the Castaneda community.\n\nTheir fondest fantasy is to be \"the first to figure out Castaneda\".  Naturally, they instantly hate this subreddit because it spells the end of their aspirations.\n\nThe more intelligent ones who notice we really are succeeding in here, will even try to stop it.  They'll claim it's \"the old sorcerers ways\", or \"evil\", \"dangerous\", or that our soul is going to be damaged in some unexplainable way.  Social threats are common, although you'd almost have to be a sorcerer to understand what  a \"social threat\" looks like.\n\nThat's when the truth comes out. They don't actually want to lead.  They're trying to fill some hole in their life, and it never occurred to them to believe what don Juan said.\n\nHumans need the unknown.  Obsessing over other people will not satisfy that need.\n\nI find them particularly annoying, because they immediately accuse me of wanting what they want. To be the leader.  I do not.  But they go on with that over and over from different angles, and on the way out will even curse me saying something like, \"You're going to end up on the trash heap of guru history\".\n\nThere's a variety of \"leader\" type that's not so obvious.  On our social media feeds, the pictures are pretty astounding.  When a \"leader\" type sees that, and if he's honest, he realizes he can't really do anything to \"teach\" or \"lead\" us based on his own knowledge.  Some former cleargreen types behave like this.  So he goes passive aggressive, and recommends something completely awful, like a book by a new or obscure fake Nagual.   He posts it on your feed, like a dog pissing on your lawn while you watch.  He leaves a fake nagual recommendation, below your stunning picture of real, honest Castaneda technique magic.\n\nYou take one look at his recommended \"teacher\", and it's totally obvious this guy is a complete fraud.  The title of his book probably even includes a Castaneda trigger word like, \"Toltec\", and he might even claim to be from a \"different lineage\".  The scam is so obvious, you wonder why this clueless visitor even comes to look at your feeds.\n\nYou're missing the obvious. That was a passive aggressive attack, to make himself feel good.  He can't \"lead\" you by giving some clueless advice, so he resorts to pointing to someone else he figures is more powerful than you are.\n\nIt's a form of, \"Oh yea???  Well my dad can beat up your dad!\"  If you go investigate the person, you'll find the have no interest at all in sorcery.   Even the former cleargreen ones.\n\n3) The crazy guy.  Mental illness is common in the Castaneda community.  The women tend to behave,  most of the time,  if this is the case.\n\nLast night, Cholita and I spent a few hours in her phantom copy of the house.  She's perfectly sober in her dreaming double.  But in the waking world, she's driven by uncontrollable moods and delusions.\n\nThe men are far worse.  A schizophrenic woman is frustrating, but a schizophrenic man is dangerous.\n\nIf whatever image of themselves they are trying to convey in here does not get the respect they believe they deserve, they turn violent.\n\nIt's common for drugs to be associated with the male type.  They're too mixed up to put in hard work to actually learn, and have gotten used to the idea of meds.  So it's not a stretch for them to become mushroom sorcerers.\n\nAnother odd feature of the crazy guy is that he tends to have relatives who are \"sorcerers\" or \"shamans\".  Maybe a Vietnam vet uncle who became his \"benefactor\".\n\nOr \"my dad is a shaman\".\n\nNaturally, since 99.999999% of those out there who claim to be shamans are complete frauds, merely memorizing inventory items as a substitute for magic, this will never be the case.\n\nThere will never be a real sorcerer who's been helping them.\n\nThe claim only helps to illustrate the intense intellectual dishonesty behind the crazy guy type.\n\nI don't say that to insult them. It's just a warning.  You probably can't ever reason with a crazy guy type.\n\nAlthough I have seen exceptions over the years.\n\n4) The groupie.  The groupie surrounds himself with people who symbolize the attention he's seeking.  He'll brag about meeting Armando or Juan, and kiss up fondly to Reni, Carol, or the missing witches.\n\nHe seems to believe that he can skip practicing, and just absorb sorcery from hanging out with the right people.\n\nHe believes there are real Naguals out there everywhere, and powerful sorcerers too.  Everywhere he goes, he believes himself to be visiting with the real thing.\n\nAnd typically he thinks it's fine that people are making a living, selling the idea that they are double beings who will teach you sorcery.  I suppose that indicates what he's really after. To be one of  those.  A con artist for cash.\n\nHis greed has put blinders on him and he'll never notice, there are no sorcerers in his path.  Only people who are happy to take advantage of him.\n\nThe female version is just looking for a better life, but it's still sad to see because they don't realize what power they have at their finger tips, if they just put in some hard work.\n\nThe male version is looking for something, but darned if I can understand it.  Groupies are a mystery to me.\n\nAnd they are particularly odious, since they zero in on whoever they believe will make their reputation better.  I commonly have to tell them to go away in private chat, at which point their head explodes and they curse me.\n\nHere's a tip about bad players in general:  I usually hear in private from someone else, that they've made a habit of being a pest elsewhere. They come here pretending the record is clean and they are sincere, when perhaps just 10 minutes ago they got tossed out from elsewhere for bullying.\n\nSo remind yourself when you rub up against a bad player, and end up with a noisy internal dialogue.\n\nYou aren't the first they've attacked.  And take comfort in the realization, intent doesn't hold standing up to bullies against you, as long as you do your best.  In fact, you will often get a reward.\n\nGroupies have one benefit: They are rumor mongers.  And some of the rumors they pick up, hanging out with phony me-too sorcery book sellers who also collect rumors, are interesting.\n\nUsually wrong, but interesting enough that in group cat they become temporary celebrities.  You can spot them that way.  They're all over group chat, until everyone figures out they are a little bit mentally ill.\n\n5) The inventory expert.  We're likely ALL guilty of being this for a while.    You read the books, they give you big endorphin rushes (like codeine pills), and you like to think more about the material, even to the point of sharing it with friends.\n\nUnfortunately it quickly turns aggressive, and you end up with places like sustained action where angry men battled for top dog, even while Carlos was trying to teach them for real.\n\nNone of those has ever learned any magic, for all their vast knowledge of sorcery \"facts\".\n\nThis subreddit is the cure for an inventory expert.  I'm not saying it makes them all realize the truth, that they need to work hard and actually learn.\n\nMost simply don't talk as much.  And so once in a while they'll pop in, to get some attention.\n\nWith dire warnings of the dangers of magic.  Or one of their favorite inventory items might get questioned in here, and they come to insist that's true. They've seen it!\n\nOut in the real world, where there's no actual magic and only talking, they probably have some sort of reputation.  Such as, \"That's the guy who saw a ...\"\n\nWhatever.  But in here, that doesn't count.  Nothing counts, unless you see it over and over again, AND can tell others how you did it.\n\nStill, inventory experts are merely annoying.  Not much of a threat in here, where pictures make them look foolish.\n\nAnd their problem is simple. They haven't realized the truth.\n\nYou cannot learn sorcery.\n\nYou cannot memorize facts that will make you a sorcerer.\n\nYou can't discuss sorcery and gain any useful insight into it.\n\nAnything not from the books of Carlos or the witches,  is harmful to learning sorcery. Even if it seems logical and insightful.\n\nMore likely than a dangerous inventory peddler, is another of the bad player types, trying to use inventory to justify his bad information.  On the way out.\n\nSuch as, \"Well, the Tibetan dwarfs say the dream time is...\"\n\nStill confusing inventory and memorized talking points, with magic.\n\nReal magic is when your inorganic being opens a rift in reality, and teaches you how to step through it into the realm of the dreaming emissary.\n\nIt's not real magic if you stop and argue with her about the color and height of the portal, and insist the tiny Tibetans did it much better.\n\nHere's a longer look at the inventory expert, the scourge of the Castaneda community:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/lg7j82/the\\_devastation\\_in\\_the\\_wake\\_of\\_inventory\\_experts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/lg7j82/the_devastation_in_the_wake_of_inventory_experts/)\n\n6 ) The Community Member.  You'll find the criticism of this type of bad player in this post.  They have some odd idea of belonging to a \"core\" of believers.\n\nThey've substituted \"belonging\" for the things in the books that got them interested in the first place.  It's like a bible study class for them, I suppose.\n\nSeeing as how there's been absolutely no magic in the 23 years since Carlos died, and the reputation of Carlos is in the toilet with the rest of the meditation/esoterica community, it's a rather clueless person.\n\nThey don't seem to realize that everyone believes Carlos has been \"thoroughly debunked\".  On coming here, they don't even bother to read enough to understand what's going on, pick the first thing they see, and complain it's not what sorcery is supposed to be.\n\nThey also don't care at all about Castaneda or they would realize, without visible magic, without being able to do things even Buddhist masters don't talk about, there is no community.  Just a dying obscure book club.\n\nMy suspicion is that this type of bad player is actually the same as the \"ulterior motive\" type.  Because having been around the Castaneda community for more than 50 years, I haven't noticed any place with \"core people\".   I'm as core as it gets, and there's only Cholita and me left now.\n\nAnd the few in here who have learned to move their assemblage points.\n\nCore people was well defined in private classes to be anyone who was working hard to learn to move their assemblage point very far, and having success.  When Carlos found one of those, he brought them up to the front of the class. Unfortunately, they never kept it up.\n\nEveryone fell into visiting, sharing, and generally engaging in the same things that blind everyone to the obvious magic right in front of their nose.\n\nYou might ask yourself, how can a \"community member\" not run into this subreddit, and have a lot of explaining to do. Such as, how come you've been a member of this community for so long, sucking up attention in chat groups, but you can't actually do anything written in the books.  Why is it all sleepy time pretending.  Reinventing your dreams, and no actual movement of the assemblage point while awake?\n\nBut they have an answer for that too!  Doesn't actually make any sense, if you understand what Carlos wrote. But it fools the \"community\", because they have the same problem.  No magic. Too lazy.\n\nThey say, \"I'm only interested in the quest for freedom.\"  Translation: I don't actually have to be able to do anything. I'm above those nasty old seer ways.\n\nI'm afraid, both cleargreen and some fake sorcery book authors are encouraging them. The story goes, just do recap and tensegrity, and you'll escape to freedom.\n\nThe problem is, if you do tensegrity correctly the energy becomes visible.  If it doesn't, you didn't do it correctly. Or probably didn't do as much as you're telling others.\n\nAnd if you recap deeply, you are swimming in visible magic and traveling to other worlds daily.\n\nThanks Armando.  More damage to the \"community\" to get your latest book deal to seem helpful, so you don't have to feel as bad for what you and Juan did.\n\nExcept, being absolutely clueless about sorcery, you're doing it even more than before!\n\n7) The Self-image Enhancer.   This is pretty much everyone when they start out, but the bad player version satisfies themselves with pretending, and never grows away from it.  They have what they want.  To be able to  think of themselves as superior, and powerful. Or wiser.\n\nI'm not quite sure what they feel, but it's all about that imaginary idea of self which their family implanted in their mind as children.  Instead of trying to escape it, they cover it with decorations.\n\nThey are basically drowning in self-pity, and have found a little bump in the river of filth, so they can get their shoulders above the mud.\n\nTheir defining feature is that they make up explanations for all the terms in the books, so as to make them something they have already done.  They also seem to have \"friends\" from other systems, who help them out by verifying their redefined idea of what sorcery is.\n\n*Dreaming* becomes any dream they can remember.  The *dreaming double* is any time in a dream when they somewhat realize they are dreaming.\n\nStopping the world becomes something ordinary, like trying to consciously go to sleep.\n\nI really find it loathsome to try to figure out how they redefine everything.  It has the potential to infect your *intent*.\n\nSo you can just read it for yourself the next time one comes to trouble this place.   The most obvious sign is the same as usual.\n\nOn stumbling into this subreddit, a truly unique place in the entire internet, they don't have the correct reaction. The correct reaction, which you can see often with people who end up practicing and making progress, is \"Holy Shit!!  I wasn't wrong all these years!  It really is true???\"\n\nAn equally ok reaction would be, \"You guys are making it up!  This can't be true.\"\n\nBut the self-image enhancer only thinks, \"Hot damn!  A place where I can get some attention.\"\n\nHe (and very commonly she) notices that these people are more serious than the Facebook and Toltec web page discussion groups out there, where nothing is actually going on.\n\nThe self-image enhancer then proceeds to post their opinions on things, as if they were adding their wise advice.\n\nBut it's all off.  If you actually understand sorcery, you have to shudder at the misleading bad advice and explanations.\n\nIf you let that go, I'm not sure what would happen. It could be they'd wake up and actually try to learn.\n\nBut the damage they do to beginners in the meantime, makes that a bad strategy.  It's probably better to challenge them, and see that their head does indeed explode.\n\nThat's what Carlos did. He was not nice.\n\nTo this day, the most famous self-image enhancer from private classes, Jeremy Donovan, is still lurking around trying to preserve his self-image enhancing ideas.\n\nHe went from pretending to be a loyal and sincere student of Carlos, helpful to the community, to being the exposer of fraud. He has a little lament he posted on sustained action, which you can read. It's all about how he was tricked, lost the closeness to his son, and was not given the respect he wanted while practicing.  He even visited here, and said that he had wasted his life, on account of Carlos.\n\nSelf-image enhancers are perhaps also back stabbers. When their enhancements fail, they find new ones.\n\nSuch as being famous as the man who took down Carlos Castaneda.\n\nThere are a bunch of lurking self-image enhancers in this subreddit.\n\nBut at least they have the self control not to prance around in their clown pants, when they realize everyone is wearing working man's jeans.\n\nThe self-image enhancer likes to play the victim card.  They do in fact go through the 5 types of bad behavior you can learn about, if you go to an alcoholic's anonymous meeting.  I can't recall those right now, but you can see them in any bad behavior of humans, where they want something and are being denied it.\n\nI once had to take a double woman to her meetings,  forced by a DUI, and found the analysis to be nearly universal when people behave badly and won't stop.\n\nSelf-pity is the worst of their tricks, because they smoke out the other self-image enhancers in the subreddit who say, \"Yea!  Stop censoring other people's ideas.  Aren't they all equal? Who are you to say?\"\n\nIn other words, sorcery is not real, and so bogus information is as good as the real thing.\n\nFollowing that idea, the world of don Juan is doomed to die at the bottom of a dump.\n\nThe self-image enhancer doesn't think about that.  Dead or not dead, his pretending is all he needs.\n\nA little self-respect to help him with the endless sadness of following the \"happily ever after\" myth we've been imprisoned by.\n\nAnd in the end, perhaps that's the reason the self-image enhancer doesn't want to learn sorcery.\n\nHe's still hooked on that ugly myth, which Carlos called, \"The chicken coop\",  and in trying to add a little something to it to make it more bearable.\n\nYou can see it in the words of Jeremy, when he said he wasted his life.  Or in the words of most self-mage enhancers, who tend to pass through the \"excuse\" phase of the 5 steps of bad behavior among addicts.  Their excuse always points back to that chicken coop myth.\n\nEven Carlos had a hard time removing the self-image enhancers from private classes. In the end, it turned out nearly everyone was in that category. Which is why at this time, there's only Cholita and me left from that batch of students. The rest are out there, feeling sorry for themselves.\n\n8) The Attention seeker.  These guys can be hard to identify for a while, because they try to be nice and polite, that being the best way to get more attention for themselves.  You can't really detect an \"ulterior motive\".  Unless you realize, they're lonely.  They probably suffer from a personality disorder, and online is the only way they can get the attention they lack.\n\nSome will private chat you mysterious messages that disappear before you get them.  Or they'll tell you, \"I'm going to tell you why I'm REALLY here.\"\n\nThey always like to post a lot, but never seem to be learning anything. They might even remain clueless about how to even **start** learning sorcery.  They read posts only to find a way they can insert themselves into the conversation.\n\nThey'll analyze things and pretend to understand, and it can even be convincing.  But sooner or later they try to turn into the \"Teacher Type\", and post something so horrible that you have to correct it for the sake of new people.\n\nSome will argue you should just be nice to them, and maybe they'll wake up.  Personally, I don't think they will.  They are about as interested in sorcery as they are in knitting.  And very lazy or they'd think to actually try learning, and get attention that way.\n\nYou can't let them go on, or you'll end up with more until the intent of your situation is destroyed, and it's just another impotent Castaneda chat room.\n\nBesides, even banned everyone can still read and learn. As far as I know, only Facebook completely blocks banned people from seeing any of the feed.\n\nAnd making people feel sorry for them, is likely their #1 trick to get attention at unreasonable levels.\n\n9) The Advanced Sorcerer.  These also overlap with the other types, but the main characteristic is that they seem to post intelligently, but once in a while they stick a little pain into their post. An attack on everyone else. Or on the subreddit itself.  Something that actually harms the beginners, so they can show that they rise above everyone else's understanding. And they make comments on things they obviously can't possibly understand, as if they have some secret advanced knowledge.  They never get specific on how they became so great, because then you could examine their practices and realize there's no way they can do what they claim.  But politeness keeps them alive in the subreddit, pissing on the rug once in a while when they get in a malicious mood.  These tend to emphasize the superficial teachings from the books, such as \"impeccability\".\n\nIn a couple of cases, it seems that they had come up with the delusion they were a \"double being\". But they probably had learned better than to bring that up in this subreddit, having gotten beaten down for it elsewhere.  So they  use it to taunt people, like a guy on cocaine does when \"conversing\" with lesser people.\n\nFor example, \"You'll be sorry when you find out who I am!\".\n\nAnd \"I only rely on my impeccability, no need for hard work...\n\n(random ranting in between, and then)\n\nDoubles have amazing amounts of energy.\n\n(with no context for saying that).\n\n10) The Stupendously Talented Guy. I suspect these are a form of internet troll, who goes from place to place trying to fill some hole in their soul.  The tricky part is, they aren't out to hurt you like a regular troll, but to impress you.  And we all hope for the super talented guy to show up one day.  So it's easy to get sucked in.  And it ought to be just as easy to spot them right away, because they find an obscure technique in this subreddit, and succeed on their first try.    Then they tell you, \"That is so cool!  Thanks for that technique, it worked amazingly well.\"  The good news is, you probably don't have to make their heads explode.  Just go along with it, and they'll get bored and move on.  Remember, it's a troll.  They need to interact with everyone going over the bridge.  It's not their thing to stick around with just one.\n\n11) The \"Helper\".  These people believe they want to \"help others\", and so they find some fake magic and elevate themselves to level of \"instructor\".  They can be spotted in the subreddit by their lingering, but being unable to keep from posting even though they aren't trying any of it, and have no sorcery knowledge to write about.  Once in a while they try to get a little attention and test the waters by disagreeing with something Carlos or don Juan taught.  As if their expertise in fake magic gave them credentials.  They aren't  hard to spot,  but early on you'd look bad for trying to prevent the damage their posts do to others.  Best thing to do is expose them by asking, until they explain what's going on.  They tend to overdo things and edit them, which can be spotted in reddit email announcements of their posts.\n\n12) \"Have you heard about this one?\"  This type of bad player seems like a good player for the longest time because they show interest, are polite, and claim to want to learn.  I've wasted as long 20 years trying to teach this type by email, with endless excuses on why they never tried anything.   And it's easy to buy the excuses, because they're friendly and want to be helpful.  But eventually you find out, they're just as clueless 20 years later as before.  I don't know what's up with this type. Lonely maybe?  But in a public setting where you have people actually learning, the guy who never learns, and always has some new thing to share, as if you needed something new because what you are doing isn't working, becomes a bad player.\n\nContinued later if a new type comes along.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit #8", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How to Recognize a Bad Player in this Subreddit", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"wpwcy6e5kxh61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 71, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wpwcy6e5kxh61.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49287cd6040b4bbae35774bbe67b6af394a90843"}, {"y": 143, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wpwcy6e5kxh61.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5527cab3bca94e0f5163c3b5b37f14c5c0aa8428"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wpwcy6e5kxh61.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=345e680c1aa027f10aaa5c3ceb0dea1dbe32ca3d"}, {"y": 426, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wpwcy6e5kxh61.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09f4985ae35fc2c9a0f13198f008fba9b5ab1a27"}, {"y": 639, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wpwcy6e5kxh61.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a02ddd2546f334ba4733b7aec96500ac7e0ad8d5"}, {"y": 719, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wpwcy6e5kxh61.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e39a2d9a0a79424132ffd9bbb34e0f3f2e5b29b"}], "s": {"y": 799, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wpwcy6e5kxh61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5da89b1445f251c1bb603816b01560c54efa7ecd"}, "id": "wpwcy6e5kxh61"}}, "name": "t3_l1coul", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/YQnPpZsNoqJ-mbjDCPccfQAe1GNwb_N-WeyfbniCbGk.jpg", "edited": 1623798900.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611160532.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wpwcy6e5kxh61.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5da89b1445f251c1bb603816b01560c54efa7ecd\"&gt;Everyone sees the fuzzy balls, but you can&amp;#39;t use the stick until they actually piss.  Pity...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan liked to analyze different types of people and behavior, in order to take the emotional content out of running into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goal of course, is to be like an empty tube to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that goal is a lifetime away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you can look at bad behavior and categorize it, you can attempt to treat it without being offended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe he used the analogy of an angry dog.  You don&amp;#39;t get down on the ground when an angry dog is barking at you through a fence, and try to explain to it how offensive its behavior is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a bad dog, that&amp;#39;s all.  Might become good some day, but who cares anyway?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are new here, you&amp;#39;ll misunderstand the purpose of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re used to religions and belief systems.  Most want you to pretend to be &amp;quot;holy&amp;quot;, or better than everyone else.  And so on  hearing that you can rub up against bad people and be unaffected, you will surely misunderstand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be picturing &amp;quot;pious&amp;quot; people, lording it over others because they are &amp;quot;superior&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And never lose their cool.  But that&amp;#39;s the opposite of what you need!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;#39;ll think, &amp;quot;Humble&amp;quot;.  But we had 23 years of impeccable humble warriors running around, pretending to be learning Castaneda&amp;#39;s sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they only became bigger idiots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The misunderstanding will be based on a total lack of knowledge of  how reality works.  But you&amp;#39;ll have to learn sorcery to understand that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think of sorcery as &amp;quot;technology&amp;quot;, not a belief system.  It&amp;#39;s a technology to summon spirits and learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t expect your computer repair guy to be a saint. Maybe he yells at his wife!  But if he can fix the computer, he&amp;#39;s a good computer repair man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, if you can do real magic, you&amp;#39;re a good sorcerer.  Even if you are not a very nice person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without that ability, we suffer endlessly.  Humans need magic!  But they&amp;#39;ve been taught that it does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s almost as if we are standing in a tub of ice water,  holding a hot potato in our left hand, and pretending everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretending we can overcome the obvious, just because of our powerful mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing that all the time is bound to make people angry.  Which explains the end game of the  attacks in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s put this in more practical terms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You work very hard, hours a day, slaving away week after week, while everyone around you tells you that it&amp;#39;s nuts, and you&amp;#39;ve gone off the deep end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, eventually you &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; go off the deep end!  You end up with a little spirit friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A 4 inch tall Fairy who will fly around your dark room for you, smiling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can say what you like, think what you like, but in the end, she either flies around the room smiling, or something else happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you rub up against a bad player, she won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t ask me why.  I don&amp;#39;t care why. She just doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you need to learn how to deal with the bad players, in  a manner which only modifies her smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she still flies around the room for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the key to that is, treating bad players the same way you treat a dangerous beast. Just get out of the way.  Don&amp;#39;t be offended, because that only harms you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have don Juan&amp;#39;s types of petty tyrants to draw from, if we wanted to create a new category of bad players.  And we have the basic personality types of people.  Puke, Piss, Fart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That list might not be complete.  If interested, get the searchable pdf.  I shudder to think what you&amp;#39;ll find, searching for &amp;quot;fart&amp;quot;.  Lots of don Genaro I suspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Petty tyrants as I recall,  include those who oppress with sadness, and those who oppress with violence. Can&amp;#39;t remember more types at this point.    But when you run into them in the real world, it stimulates the memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, with a bad player in here you&amp;#39;ll see those types.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s possible to analyze it further, to spot them more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s some quick ways to get clued in&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They come here and have no interest in practicing, but lots of interest in posting.  The posts are all somehow oddly self-promoting, without any actual information that would help someone learn sorcery.  Let&amp;#39;s face it!  The world of Castaneda was dead until recently. No magic, no supernatural goings on.  It was all pretending.  If someone comes in here and doesn&amp;#39;t exclaim in some way, &amp;quot;Oh my God, you mean it all works???&amp;quot;, something is seriously wrong.  What&amp;#39;s wrong is clear. They don&amp;#39;t care if it works.  That&amp;#39;s not what they are after.  It&amp;#39;s even possible they assume the whole thing is a fraud, and so who are you to criticize their version of the fraud?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They have posturing user IDs, or sign their name on posts with something designed to make them sound powerful.  Trigger words seem to be &amp;quot;nagual&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Toltec&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;brujo&amp;quot;, and all the usual suspects used on web pages to attract traffic.  You have to keep in mind, these are sad people.   You don&amp;#39;t go around posturing with nothing to back it up, unless you are hurting in your normal persona.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Their user ID has no  history.  Of course this isn&amp;#39;t an indicator, but it&amp;#39;s good to verify if it&amp;#39;s possible they often go around being a troll, and don&amp;#39;t want you to see that.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They claim to be a &amp;quot;good guy&amp;quot;, only interested in helping the community.  This is in fact mostly an obsession with other people.  Someone who hasn&amp;#39;t actually learned any sorcery is incapable of helping the community. Or anyone else, according to don Juan. Truth is, without magic in your life, real magic in your face, you are a petty confused and angry person trying to gain the favor of other angry confused people.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s a woman who asks a lot of lifestyle related questions, but never takes an interest in practicing.  This person is likely looking for a &amp;quot;soul mate&amp;quot;. Careful. These are tricky and it can take a long time to realize you are wasting your time to try to teach them. If they start discussing other teachings, as if those are alternatives,  don&amp;#39;t waste your time with them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They have a heavy interest in power plants.  While this isn&amp;#39;t by itself a problem, if the person also seems mentally ill, it&amp;#39;s certainly a sign that they are not going to learn for real and become helpful to restoring the reputation of Carlos. In fact, they will damage it.  The #1 search result on google is probably still from a bogus magazine article saying something like, &amp;quot;The Drugs were Real, but the rest was not&amp;quot;.  That from interviewing former private class students, on whom Carlos spent years and years.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They have  a relative who is a &amp;quot;sorcerer&amp;quot;, and seem to believe this gives them some authority.  Truth is, believing that a sorcerer relative gives them authority shows a complete lack of sorcery knowledge.  You can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;absorb&amp;quot; sorcery from a relative, and especially not since their relative is certainly another bad player.  They will merely be a more &amp;quot;entitled&amp;quot; bad player.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They manage to announce, &amp;quot;I can *see*&amp;quot;, possibly in group chat.  No one asked. They just wanted you to know that.  I run into it on Facebook too. I&amp;#39;ll see someone who has a reasonable don Juan content to their Facebook, nothing excessive.  I mention this place, they take a look and say, &amp;quot;Nice. But I can already *see*.&amp;quot;   If they never end up over here, bullying others for attention, I&amp;#39;d say this is just someone who all along only had a casual interest, and decided to just forget the whole thing and declare victory.  But they still like their friends to think of them as &amp;quot;magical&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continued when I think of more...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s some proposed &amp;quot;types&amp;quot; of bad players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 ) Ulterior motive.  These people talk as if they understand everything posted, praise people, and generally post stuff that helps no one, serving to only promote themselves as being willing to participate.   You&amp;#39;ll be surprised when they first show up, thinking maybe this is a lone wolf sorcerer who found his way here, and actually does understand all the things they seem to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they do not.  And they&amp;#39;ll show no actual interest in learning. Their interest is to promote or sell something else, when they get a chance.  Promoting something else doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean it&amp;#39;s for sale. It could simply be the fantasy they&amp;#39;ve been living off for years, instead of practicing sorcery, and they want to enforce that this is the true path in order to make themselves feel better while pretending.  I guess it&amp;#39;s like a man who wears clown pants all the time, showing up to a group and asking, &amp;quot;Clown pants are cool, right???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These come in many forms, from small fry guy with an obsession on Chinese philosophy as key to understanding, but it could escalate all the way to someone selling a cell phone ap that doesn&amp;#39;t actually do anything helpful.  Or even someone promoting a useless parasite guru out there because he has an interest in both topics, and has never actually learned to do any magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best way to spot these is by the beginner mistakes they make, in understanding sorcery terms and concepts. For instance, mistaking &amp;quot;dark energy&amp;quot;, for some sort of blissful feeling that comes with light, during meditation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or they&amp;#39;ll say something that&amp;#39;s actually funny for how poorly  they understand it.  Such as mistaking, &amp;quot;Assembling another world&amp;quot;, for organizing your witchcraft supplies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The misunderstandings are usually designed to make themselves feel more powerful or successful on whatever path they are actually on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) The leader.  These people want others to give them praise and attention.  They often have web pages or social media where they do absolutely nothing to help people actually learn, as evidenced by nothing going on there for decades.  And yet, they pretend to be helpful.  What they really want is a reputation as the top of the heap in the Castaneda community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their fondest fantasy is to be &amp;quot;the first to figure out Castaneda&amp;quot;.  Naturally, they instantly hate this subreddit because it spells the end of their aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more intelligent ones who notice we really are succeeding in here, will even try to stop it.  They&amp;#39;ll claim it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;the old sorcerers ways&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dangerous&amp;quot;, or that our soul is going to be damaged in some unexplainable way.  Social threats are common, although you&amp;#39;d almost have to be a sorcerer to understand what  a &amp;quot;social threat&amp;quot; looks like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when the truth comes out. They don&amp;#39;t actually want to lead.  They&amp;#39;re trying to fill some hole in their life, and it never occurred to them to believe what don Juan said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Humans need the unknown.  Obsessing over other people will not satisfy that need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find them particularly annoying, because they immediately accuse me of wanting what they want. To be the leader.  I do not.  But they go on with that over and over from different angles, and on the way out will even curse me saying something like, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re going to end up on the trash heap of guru history&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a variety of &amp;quot;leader&amp;quot; type that&amp;#39;s not so obvious.  On our social media feeds, the pictures are pretty astounding.  When a &amp;quot;leader&amp;quot; type sees that, and if he&amp;#39;s honest, he realizes he can&amp;#39;t really do anything to &amp;quot;teach&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;lead&amp;quot; us based on his own knowledge.  Some former cleargreen types behave like this.  So he goes passive aggressive, and recommends something completely awful, like a book by a new or obscure fake Nagual.   He posts it on your feed, like a dog pissing on your lawn while you watch.  He leaves a fake nagual recommendation, below your stunning picture of real, honest Castaneda technique magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You take one look at his recommended &amp;quot;teacher&amp;quot;, and it&amp;#39;s totally obvious this guy is a complete fraud.  The title of his book probably even includes a Castaneda trigger word like, &amp;quot;Toltec&amp;quot;, and he might even claim to be from a &amp;quot;different lineage&amp;quot;.  The scam is so obvious, you wonder why this clueless visitor even comes to look at your feeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re missing the obvious. That was a passive aggressive attack, to make himself feel good.  He can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;lead&amp;quot; you by giving some clueless advice, so he resorts to pointing to someone else he figures is more powerful than you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a form of, &amp;quot;Oh yea???  Well my dad can beat up your dad!&amp;quot;  If you go investigate the person, you&amp;#39;ll find the have no interest at all in sorcery.   Even the former cleargreen ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) The crazy guy.  Mental illness is common in the Castaneda community.  The women tend to behave,  most of the time,  if this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night, Cholita and I spent a few hours in her phantom copy of the house.  She&amp;#39;s perfectly sober in her dreaming double.  But in the waking world, she&amp;#39;s driven by uncontrollable moods and delusions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The men are far worse.  A schizophrenic woman is frustrating, but a schizophrenic man is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If whatever image of themselves they are trying to convey in here does not get the respect they believe they deserve, they turn violent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s common for drugs to be associated with the male type.  They&amp;#39;re too mixed up to put in hard work to actually learn, and have gotten used to the idea of meds.  So it&amp;#39;s not a stretch for them to become mushroom sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another odd feature of the crazy guy is that he tends to have relatives who are &amp;quot;sorcerers&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;shamans&amp;quot;.  Maybe a Vietnam vet uncle who became his &amp;quot;benefactor&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or &amp;quot;my dad is a shaman&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, since 99.999999% of those out there who claim to be shamans are complete frauds, merely memorizing inventory items as a substitute for magic, this will never be the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There will never be a real sorcerer who&amp;#39;s been helping them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The claim only helps to illustrate the intense intellectual dishonesty behind the crazy guy type.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t say that to insult them. It&amp;#39;s just a warning.  You probably can&amp;#39;t ever reason with a crazy guy type.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I have seen exceptions over the years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) The groupie.  The groupie surrounds himself with people who symbolize the attention he&amp;#39;s seeking.  He&amp;#39;ll brag about meeting Armando or Juan, and kiss up fondly to Reni, Carol, or the missing witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He seems to believe that he can skip practicing, and just absorb sorcery from hanging out with the right people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He believes there are real Naguals out there everywhere, and powerful sorcerers too.  Everywhere he goes, he believes himself to be visiting with the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And typically he thinks it&amp;#39;s fine that people are making a living, selling the idea that they are double beings who will teach you sorcery.  I suppose that indicates what he&amp;#39;s really after. To be one of  those.  A con artist for cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His greed has put blinders on him and he&amp;#39;ll never notice, there are no sorcerers in his path.  Only people who are happy to take advantage of him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The female version is just looking for a better life, but it&amp;#39;s still sad to see because they don&amp;#39;t realize what power they have at their finger tips, if they just put in some hard work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The male version is looking for something, but darned if I can understand it.  Groupies are a mystery to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they are particularly odious, since they zero in on whoever they believe will make their reputation better.  I commonly have to tell them to go away in private chat, at which point their head explodes and they curse me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a tip about bad players in general:  I usually hear in private from someone else, that they&amp;#39;ve made a habit of being a pest elsewhere. They come here pretending the record is clean and they are sincere, when perhaps just 10 minutes ago they got tossed out from elsewhere for bullying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So remind yourself when you rub up against a bad player, and end up with a noisy internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You aren&amp;#39;t the first they&amp;#39;ve attacked.  And take comfort in the realization, intent doesn&amp;#39;t hold standing up to bullies against you, as long as you do your best.  In fact, you will often get a reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Groupies have one benefit: They are rumor mongers.  And some of the rumors they pick up, hanging out with phony me-too sorcery book sellers who also collect rumors, are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually wrong, but interesting enough that in group cat they become temporary celebrities.  You can spot them that way.  They&amp;#39;re all over group chat, until everyone figures out they are a little bit mentally ill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) The inventory expert.  We&amp;#39;re likely ALL guilty of being this for a while.    You read the books, they give you big endorphin rushes (like codeine pills), and you like to think more about the material, even to the point of sharing it with friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it quickly turns aggressive, and you end up with places like sustained action where angry men battled for top dog, even while Carlos was trying to teach them for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of those has ever learned any magic, for all their vast knowledge of sorcery &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This subreddit is the cure for an inventory expert.  I&amp;#39;m not saying it makes them all realize the truth, that they need to work hard and actually learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most simply don&amp;#39;t talk as much.  And so once in a while they&amp;#39;ll pop in, to get some attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With dire warnings of the dangers of magic.  Or one of their favorite inventory items might get questioned in here, and they come to insist that&amp;#39;s true. They&amp;#39;ve seen it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out in the real world, where there&amp;#39;s no actual magic and only talking, they probably have some sort of reputation.  Such as, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s the guy who saw a ...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever.  But in here, that doesn&amp;#39;t count.  Nothing counts, unless you see it over and over again, AND can tell others how you did it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, inventory experts are merely annoying.  Not much of a threat in here, where pictures make them look foolish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And their problem is simple. They haven&amp;#39;t realized the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You cannot learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You cannot memorize facts that will make you a sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t discuss sorcery and gain any useful insight into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything not from the books of Carlos or the witches,  is harmful to learning sorcery. Even if it seems logical and insightful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More likely than a dangerous inventory peddler, is another of the bad player types, trying to use inventory to justify his bad information.  On the way out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as, &amp;quot;Well, the Tibetan dwarfs say the dream time is...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still confusing inventory and memorized talking points, with magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real magic is when your inorganic being opens a rift in reality, and teaches you how to step through it into the realm of the dreaming emissary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not real magic if you stop and argue with her about the color and height of the portal, and insist the tiny Tibetans did it much better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a longer look at the inventory expert, the scourge of the Castaneda community:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/lg7j82/the_devastation_in_the_wake_of_inventory_experts/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/lg7j82/the_devastation_in_the_wake_of_inventory_experts/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6 ) The Community Member.  You&amp;#39;ll find the criticism of this type of bad player in this post.  They have some odd idea of belonging to a &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; of believers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve substituted &amp;quot;belonging&amp;quot; for the things in the books that got them interested in the first place.  It&amp;#39;s like a bible study class for them, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing as how there&amp;#39;s been absolutely no magic in the 23 years since Carlos died, and the reputation of Carlos is in the toilet with the rest of the meditation/esoterica community, it&amp;#39;s a rather clueless person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t seem to realize that everyone believes Carlos has been &amp;quot;thoroughly debunked&amp;quot;.  On coming here, they don&amp;#39;t even bother to read enough to understand what&amp;#39;s going on, pick the first thing they see, and complain it&amp;#39;s not what sorcery is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They also don&amp;#39;t care at all about Castaneda or they would realize, without visible magic, without being able to do things even Buddhist masters don&amp;#39;t talk about, there is no community.  Just a dying obscure book club.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My suspicion is that this type of bad player is actually the same as the &amp;quot;ulterior motive&amp;quot; type.  Because having been around the Castaneda community for more than 50 years, I haven&amp;#39;t noticed any place with &amp;quot;core people&amp;quot;.   I&amp;#39;m as core as it gets, and there&amp;#39;s only Cholita and me left now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the few in here who have learned to move their assemblage points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Core people was well defined in private classes to be anyone who was working hard to learn to move their assemblage point very far, and having success.  When Carlos found one of those, he brought them up to the front of the class. Unfortunately, they never kept it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone fell into visiting, sharing, and generally engaging in the same things that blind everyone to the obvious magic right in front of their nose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might ask yourself, how can a &amp;quot;community member&amp;quot; not run into this subreddit, and have a lot of explaining to do. Such as, how come you&amp;#39;ve been a member of this community for so long, sucking up attention in chat groups, but you can&amp;#39;t actually do anything written in the books.  Why is it all sleepy time pretending.  Reinventing your dreams, and no actual movement of the assemblage point while awake?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they have an answer for that too!  Doesn&amp;#39;t actually make any sense, if you understand what Carlos wrote. But it fools the &amp;quot;community&amp;quot;, because they have the same problem.  No magic. Too lazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They say, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m only interested in the quest for freedom.&amp;quot;  Translation: I don&amp;#39;t actually have to be able to do anything. I&amp;#39;m above those nasty old seer ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid, both cleargreen and some fake sorcery book authors are encouraging them. The story goes, just do recap and tensegrity, and you&amp;#39;ll escape to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, if you do tensegrity correctly the energy becomes visible.  If it doesn&amp;#39;t, you didn&amp;#39;t do it correctly. Or probably didn&amp;#39;t do as much as you&amp;#39;re telling others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you recap deeply, you are swimming in visible magic and traveling to other worlds daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks Armando.  More damage to the &amp;quot;community&amp;quot; to get your latest book deal to seem helpful, so you don&amp;#39;t have to feel as bad for what you and Juan did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, being absolutely clueless about sorcery, you&amp;#39;re doing it even more than before!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) The Self-image Enhancer.   This is pretty much everyone when they start out, but the bad player version satisfies themselves with pretending, and never grows away from it.  They have what they want.  To be able to  think of themselves as superior, and powerful. Or wiser.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not quite sure what they feel, but it&amp;#39;s all about that imaginary idea of self which their family implanted in their mind as children.  Instead of trying to escape it, they cover it with decorations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are basically drowning in self-pity, and have found a little bump in the river of filth, so they can get their shoulders above the mud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their defining feature is that they make up explanations for all the terms in the books, so as to make them something they have already done.  They also seem to have &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; from other systems, who help them out by verifying their redefined idea of what sorcery is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreaming&lt;/em&gt; becomes any dream they can remember.  The &lt;em&gt;dreaming double&lt;/em&gt; is any time in a dream when they somewhat realize they are dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stopping the world becomes something ordinary, like trying to consciously go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really find it loathsome to try to figure out how they redefine everything.  It has the potential to infect your &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can just read it for yourself the next time one comes to trouble this place.   The most obvious sign is the same as usual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On stumbling into this subreddit, a truly unique place in the entire internet, they don&amp;#39;t have the correct reaction. The correct reaction, which you can see often with people who end up practicing and making progress, is &amp;quot;Holy Shit!!  I wasn&amp;#39;t wrong all these years!  It really is true???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An equally ok reaction would be, &amp;quot;You guys are making it up!  This can&amp;#39;t be true.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the self-image enhancer only thinks, &amp;quot;Hot damn!  A place where I can get some attention.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He (and very commonly she) notices that these people are more serious than the Facebook and Toltec web page discussion groups out there, where nothing is actually going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The self-image enhancer then proceeds to post their opinions on things, as if they were adding their wise advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s all off.  If you actually understand sorcery, you have to shudder at the misleading bad advice and explanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you let that go, I&amp;#39;m not sure what would happen. It could be they&amp;#39;d wake up and actually try to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the damage they do to beginners in the meantime, makes that a bad strategy.  It&amp;#39;s probably better to challenge them, and see that their head does indeed explode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what Carlos did. He was not nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To this day, the most famous self-image enhancer from private classes, Jeremy Donovan, is still lurking around trying to preserve his self-image enhancing ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He went from pretending to be a loyal and sincere student of Carlos, helpful to the community, to being the exposer of fraud. He has a little lament he posted on sustained action, which you can read. It&amp;#39;s all about how he was tricked, lost the closeness to his son, and was not given the respect he wanted while practicing.  He even visited here, and said that he had wasted his life, on account of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Self-image enhancers are perhaps also back stabbers. When their enhancements fail, they find new ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as being famous as the man who took down Carlos Castaneda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of lurking self-image enhancers in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at least they have the self control not to prance around in their clown pants, when they realize everyone is wearing working man&amp;#39;s jeans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The self-image enhancer likes to play the victim card.  They do in fact go through the 5 types of bad behavior you can learn about, if you go to an alcoholic&amp;#39;s anonymous meeting.  I can&amp;#39;t recall those right now, but you can see them in any bad behavior of humans, where they want something and are being denied it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once had to take a double woman to her meetings,  forced by a DUI, and found the analysis to be nearly universal when people behave badly and won&amp;#39;t stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Self-pity is the worst of their tricks, because they smoke out the other self-image enhancers in the subreddit who say, &amp;quot;Yea!  Stop censoring other people&amp;#39;s ideas.  Aren&amp;#39;t they all equal? Who are you to say?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, sorcery is not real, and so bogus information is as good as the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following that idea, the world of don Juan is doomed to die at the bottom of a dump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The self-image enhancer doesn&amp;#39;t think about that.  Dead or not dead, his pretending is all he needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little self-respect to help him with the endless sadness of following the &amp;quot;happily ever after&amp;quot; myth we&amp;#39;ve been imprisoned by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in the end, perhaps that&amp;#39;s the reason the self-image enhancer doesn&amp;#39;t want to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s still hooked on that ugly myth, which Carlos called, &amp;quot;The chicken coop&amp;quot;,  and in trying to add a little something to it to make it more bearable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see it in the words of Jeremy, when he said he wasted his life.  Or in the words of most self-mage enhancers, who tend to pass through the &amp;quot;excuse&amp;quot; phase of the 5 steps of bad behavior among addicts.  Their excuse always points back to that chicken coop myth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Carlos had a hard time removing the self-image enhancers from private classes. In the end, it turned out nearly everyone was in that category. Which is why at this time, there&amp;#39;s only Cholita and me left from that batch of students. The rest are out there, feeling sorry for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8) The Attention seeker.  These guys can be hard to identify for a while, because they try to be nice and polite, that being the best way to get more attention for themselves.  You can&amp;#39;t really detect an &amp;quot;ulterior motive&amp;quot;.  Unless you realize, they&amp;#39;re lonely.  They probably suffer from a personality disorder, and online is the only way they can get the attention they lack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some will private chat you mysterious messages that disappear before you get them.  Or they&amp;#39;ll tell you, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to tell you why I&amp;#39;m REALLY here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They always like to post a lot, but never seem to be learning anything. They might even remain clueless about how to even &lt;strong&gt;start&lt;/strong&gt; learning sorcery.  They read posts only to find a way they can insert themselves into the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll analyze things and pretend to understand, and it can even be convincing.  But sooner or later they try to turn into the &amp;quot;Teacher Type&amp;quot;, and post something so horrible that you have to correct it for the sake of new people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some will argue you should just be nice to them, and maybe they&amp;#39;ll wake up.  Personally, I don&amp;#39;t think they will.  They are about as interested in sorcery as they are in knitting.  And very lazy or they&amp;#39;d think to actually try learning, and get attention that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t let them go on, or you&amp;#39;ll end up with more until the intent of your situation is destroyed, and it&amp;#39;s just another impotent Castaneda chat room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides, even banned everyone can still read and learn. As far as I know, only Facebook completely blocks banned people from seeing any of the feed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And making people feel sorry for them, is likely their #1 trick to get attention at unreasonable levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9) The Advanced Sorcerer.  These also overlap with the other types, but the main characteristic is that they seem to post intelligently, but once in a while they stick a little pain into their post. An attack on everyone else. Or on the subreddit itself.  Something that actually harms the beginners, so they can show that they rise above everyone else&amp;#39;s understanding. And they make comments on things they obviously can&amp;#39;t possibly understand, as if they have some secret advanced knowledge.  They never get specific on how they became so great, because then you could examine their practices and realize there&amp;#39;s no way they can do what they claim.  But politeness keeps them alive in the subreddit, pissing on the rug once in a while when they get in a malicious mood.  These tend to emphasize the superficial teachings from the books, such as &amp;quot;impeccability&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a couple of cases, it seems that they had come up with the delusion they were a &amp;quot;double being&amp;quot;. But they probably had learned better than to bring that up in this subreddit, having gotten beaten down for it elsewhere.  So they  use it to taunt people, like a guy on cocaine does when &amp;quot;conversing&amp;quot; with lesser people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll be sorry when you find out who I am!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;I only rely on my impeccability, no need for hard work...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(random ranting in between, and then)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doubles have amazing amounts of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(with no context for saying that).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10) The Stupendously Talented Guy. I suspect these are a form of internet troll, who goes from place to place trying to fill some hole in their soul.  The tricky part is, they aren&amp;#39;t out to hurt you like a regular troll, but to impress you.  And we all hope for the super talented guy to show up one day.  So it&amp;#39;s easy to get sucked in.  And it ought to be just as easy to spot them right away, because they find an obscure technique in this subreddit, and succeed on their first try.    Then they tell you, &amp;quot;That is so cool!  Thanks for that technique, it worked amazingly well.&amp;quot;  The good news is, you probably don&amp;#39;t have to make their heads explode.  Just go along with it, and they&amp;#39;ll get bored and move on.  Remember, it&amp;#39;s a troll.  They need to interact with everyone going over the bridge.  It&amp;#39;s not their thing to stick around with just one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11) The &amp;quot;Helper&amp;quot;.  These people believe they want to &amp;quot;help others&amp;quot;, and so they find some fake magic and elevate themselves to level of &amp;quot;instructor&amp;quot;.  They can be spotted in the subreddit by their lingering, but being unable to keep from posting even though they aren&amp;#39;t trying any of it, and have no sorcery knowledge to write about.  Once in a while they try to get a little attention and test the waters by disagreeing with something Carlos or don Juan taught.  As if their expertise in fake magic gave them credentials.  They aren&amp;#39;t  hard to spot,  but early on you&amp;#39;d look bad for trying to prevent the damage their posts do to others.  Best thing to do is expose them by asking, until they explain what&amp;#39;s going on.  They tend to overdo things and edit them, which can be spotted in reddit email announcements of their posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12) &amp;quot;Have you heard about this one?&amp;quot;  This type of bad player seems like a good player for the longest time because they show interest, are polite, and claim to want to learn.  I&amp;#39;ve wasted as long 20 years trying to teach this type by email, with endless excuses on why they never tried anything.   And it&amp;#39;s easy to buy the excuses, because they&amp;#39;re friendly and want to be helpful.  But eventually you find out, they&amp;#39;re just as clueless 20 years later as before.  I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s up with this type. Lonely maybe?

Maybe 2 or 3 months, and you still need 3 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That leaves gazing.

[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "What is an inorganic being, and what\u2019s the difference from an \u201cAlly\u201d?\n\nBeats me.  But according to Carlos, an inorganic being is a general category.  Within that category, there are 7 types.  We know about the water spirit type from the mirror technique in Carlos\u2019 books.  And we know that the ones that are useful enough to call an \u201cAlly\u201d come from the center of the universe.\n\nThey project themselves in some way.  And doing that, they can activate ideas in our minds, and take on an appearance.  But they can\u2019t hold it, so you can stare at them to make them change, and eventually you can discover if you\u2019re looking at the real thing, or at a phantasm.   If it was just a phantasm (your own mind), it\u2019ll go away. If it was an inorganic being, you\u2019ll \u201csee\u201d its essence, which is a bar of light, vertical or horizontal.\n\nThis can take place both in waking, and in dreaming.  They probably have no limit to where they can interact with us.  Even better, they can move your assemblage point, and want to teach us to interact with them more.  They\u2019ll mentor us if we let them. At a price.\n\nIs all of this true?  It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s useful.  And as long as you aren\u2019t pretending in order to get that book deal, and you really do experience a being in front of you, which has no organic body, you\u2019re looking at an \u201cinorganic being\u201d.\n\nAnd when you\u2019re trying to \u201cnavigate\u201d, meaning, learn sorcery, you need to use anything you can.  You don\u2019t worry about true or untrue, just what produces a good result.\n\nI suspect, if it helps you out by moving your assemblage point for you, that makes it an \u201cAlly\u201d. But to be pure and true, you have to have been introduced to one from a previous lineage, the way Carlos introduced us to his. If I can figure out how, I\u2019ll do the same for you.\n\nThe allies are easy to share, so we can\u2019t really run out.    You just need for them to be around you, and for you to be interested in such things.  You don\u2019t have to actually perceive them at the time.  They'll notice that you are interested.\n\nThe ones Carlos has come from a place where they have many friends, and if they\u2019re around you, the others might show up.  Eventually they want to pull you into their world.  But you can resist that fairly easily.\n\nThe allies are wonderful because they can move your assemblage point. They do it by swooping around you, which creates some kind of wave, like a ripple on water.  Don Juan exposed Carlos to that swoop by using a campfire.  In private classes, Carlos introduced them to us by using the water cooler.  He pointed out that an Ally was there right now, we looked, then he pointed to the other end of the room, and said it was over there now.\n\nThe wave created by the swoop moves the assemblage point.  You can eventually learn to perceive it, but in the beginning it\u2019s a very subtle feeling of the blackness around you having been disturbed, silently. Too silently\u2026\n\nLast night I was practicing silence and looking at colors in the darkness.  I\u2019d given up on trying to control my inorganic being, which I had coerced into a fairy shape.  Someone here quoted don Juan saying everything they do is significant. I hadn\u2019t remembered that.  I thought I could control them and learn that way.  But last night, I decided to leave the Fairy alone.  Let her do what she wanted, and then try to figure out the significance.\n\nI was looking at an overall orangish coloration to the room, waiting for a patch of purple to show up. When it did, I grabbed it and stretched it, then compressed it again with my hands.  I wanted to place it on my leg and rub it across the length. The last time I tried that, my entire leg turned glowing purple.  The strangest thing about it was, how bright it became.  I could even see the bed and my leg, because of the glow.\n\nBut in the middle of the purple patch I was fluffing with my hands, the Fairy\u2019s head materialized. She wasn\u2019t smiling.  I said, \u201cYou\u2019re always welcome anytime!\u201d\n\nShe smiled, and faded out.  Having decided not to mess with her, I went back to what I was doing.\n\nA quick interrruption of the story: The Allies don't animate the way you'd think. In a dream, they're as natural as the other dream characters. But when seen awake, they sort of morph from one image to the other.  And each morph reacts to what you thought about the last morph.\n\nIt can be so smooth you think they're animated like a normal being, but if you look closely, they only morph.  I'll be anxious to see what happens when others of you can do this.  Maybe you can tell me the rate at which they morph.  Or maybe they don't morph, unless you look too closely at them.\n\nBack to the story, I decided not to  mess with the fairy and went back to work.  A few feet away, a bluish patch of color emerged, with the Fairy in the middle. She was being swallowed up by bed sheets and linen.  It was as if she were sinking into quicksand made out of fabric, and the last thing I saw was her  mouth open in horror, as she was sucked into the mess.\n\nI went back to what I was doing, but the thought that everything the Allies do has significance, echoed in my mind.\n\nI lifted up the comforter, and put it over my head.  I thought maybe I was supposed to join her in the quicksand of fabric. I was completely encased by the comforter.  The darkness was now absolute.\n\nThe fairy emerged right in front of me, her face only a couple of inches away.  She looked puzzled.   Then she faded away, and I remained there waiting for her to return, until I worried if I might smother in there.\n\nI went back to sitting up on the bed, uncovered, and concentrated on forcing myself even more silent.\n\nA black object swooped from my upper right, to my lower left. I felt the ripples in the air, even though there was absolutely no sound or movement of the air.  A shock went over me, and my head and back jerked forward a bit, like hitting a slight bump in the road while seated in a car.  I had a tingling feeling and realized, she\u2019d moved my assemblage point.\n\nOut of the corner of my right eye, I saw a figure. It was my Fairy, now a full human size, walking along in the most outlandish costumes made of excessive quantities of fabric.   But the most important thing was, she was doing what I had tried to get her to do, days earlier.  She was walking!\n\nWhat\u2019s the thing about walking?  Walking is directional. It means, she\u2019d become a visible being in the room, who is located at a specific spot.  She wasn\u2019t following the movement of my head, the way hypnogogic images do.  She was so real looking, it could have been a Disneyland ghost effect using mirrors.  And I was awake, with my eyes open.  It's normal to see an Ally in dreaming, and they'll have a seemingly normal looking human form.  But getting them to do that while you are awake is another thing.\n\nShe walked across the entire length of the room, to my right, then vanished.  For the entire walk, her costume continually changed and morphed, but it was always covering nearly all of her body. It was also always a dull white, even though she was made out of blue light.\n\nIt was getting too hot in the room. I had a little heater on, but I had to close the bedroom door to keep it dark.  It was inevitable that eventually it would be uncomfortably hot.  I couldn't adjust any settings on it, because I'd covered all the LEDs on it with aluminum tape, to keep the room dark. Essentially, the heater only had on and off now.\n\nI got up to turn it off, then realized I could drape a small blanket over me, and be doing what the Ally had shown me. Maybe I wasn\u2019t supposed to encase myself in the comforter, but instead drape a blanket around me, leaving my head exposed.\n\nI had no idea if that was the right thing to do, but the blanket would make it possible to leave the heater off for that evening.  And if I turned it off, it would soon be a little too cold.  A blanket was just the thing.\n\nMy room is very dark, so I was stumbling around the bed to head for the next room where I had a suitable blanket.  But halfway along, I was seeing so many crazy lights and puffs of color, that I stopped to try to grab some, and stretch the colors around me for a blanket instead.\n\nOnce I did that, I could see my luminous shell.  That\u2019s the jackpot of silence techniques!  I focused my attention only on that.  Silence was already there, but the final step to stop the world, is to focus the attention outside our normal realm and worries.  Silence even that attention focusing ability inside us, so to speak.  If you don't do that, it'll start to focus on worldy images and the silence will be incomplete.  As far as I know, it always has to focus on something; it never stops.\n\nI noticed that the color I had wrapped around myself was orange red.  I wondered if I could wrap purple around me too.  But as soon as I thought about that, and looked around for purple colors, I noticed I was in a yellow-brown world.   I\u2019ve come to know that as the portal between worlds.  It also means, I had nearly stopped the world.  Only tiny pieces of it remained.\n\nI saw details there, all around me. It was like being in a weird desert surrounded by giant ant-hills. They were like the kind where ants use mud to build a structure as tall as a person.  Except they didn\u2019t look like the ones I\u2019ve seen in nature specials.  As I examined them out of the corner of my eye, it was obvious they could be anything at all.  Perhaps they were part of a world I was being offered.\n\nOne of the problems with stopping the world is, there\u2019s no reason for you to remember it.  And this occasion was only half different. I remember stopping it, and the feeling of absolute silence that was needed.  It was the deepest silence I\u2019ve ever experienced.\n\nBut I don\u2019t remember how I got back to bed.  In the morning, all I could remember was, the Ally had shown me corn chips in 2 colors.  Bluish green that could have been tinted purple, and orange red.  They were floating in space and I could see the thickness of the corn chips, and their length and twists, just like Frito Lay Chips that had been dipped in food coloring.\n\nJust thinking about them gave me an alien feeling.  That\u2019s why people say dreamers are morose.  Their attention is focused on things not of this world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: five times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Inorganic Beings and Corn Chips", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_bu347v", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1559175237.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1559065838.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is an inorganic being, and what\u2019s the difference from an \u201cAlly\u201d?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beats me.

In the books of Carlos they don&amp;#39;t seem to be. In the books of Taisha, it actually equates them in one sentence found in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe this explains it, a discussion of the old seers, in those tensegrity transcripts:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They considered the self to be a holistic unit which includes both: body and mind, matter and spirit together; and they defined the energy body as a particular conglomerate of energy fields belonging to each of us individually, that has the capability of being transformed into a perfect replica of the self, and vice-versa: they believed that the self has the capability of being transformed into a perfect replica of the energy body, that is to say, a conglomerate of sheer energy fields.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish he hadn&amp;#39;t used, &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if the self is the physical body, then it says our energy body can transform itself into a perfect replica of our physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that also, the physical body can transform itself into a perfect replica of the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the topic is even more complicated than we thought.

You're too far off to succeed.\n\nThink of sorcery as being like railroad tracks.  You have to get on the right ones and then the tracks themselves move you the right direction.  But if you get on the wrong track, you go the wrong direction\n\nAnd as far as I know, this is the only direction with magic this powerful (thanks to thousands of years of the Olmecs practicing and discovering).\n\nAlso, you seem to believe you can memorize facts, and that's learning sorcery.\n\nWon't work.\n\nYou have to get the outside help of \"intent\".\n\nBut intent helps all paths, so you have to have an  understanding of this Olmec path and then intent does the magic for you.\n\nIf you don't know the basics, you won't get the help from that magical force.\n\nMissing a basic understanding, I'm not sure what  you ought to read to fix that.\n\nCertainly someone else shouldn't have to do the work for you. That tends to attract attention seekers who don't really want to learn, but only want to participate in talking.  Won't work!\n\nBut, quickly, there are only 2 things in existance.\n\nThe emanations, which exist forever and can't be changed or created.\n\nAnd awareness that makes some glow.\n\nThe emanation exist in the dark sea of awareness.  But aren't glowing much, unless you lend them your awareness.\n\nYou can't deliberately do that, unless you learn to get rid of that internal dialogue.\n\nSo to do what you were asking about, you have to get rid of that internal dialogue.  Nothing you can memorize will help at all. In fact, most 'facts\" harm sorcery, they don't help it.\n\nBottom line:  you're trying to get out of working by talking instead, and your motivations are dubious.\n\nIn any other system (buddhism, yoga, daoism, astral travel, shamanism) people are trying to earn money.  Those are businesses.

You have to get on the right ones and then the tracks themselves move you the right direction.  But if you get on the wrong track, you go the wrong direction&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as far as I know, this is the only direction with magic this powerful (thanks to thousands of years of the Olmecs practicing and discovering).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, you seem to believe you can memorize facts, and that&amp;#39;s learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Won&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to get the outside help of &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But intent helps all paths, so you have to have an  understanding of this Olmec path and then intent does the magic for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t know the basics, you won&amp;#39;t get the help from that magical force.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Missing a basic understanding, I&amp;#39;m not sure what  you ought to read to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly someone else shouldn&amp;#39;t have to do the work for you. That tends to attract attention seekers who don&amp;#39;t really want to learn, but only want to participate in talking.  Won&amp;#39;t work!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, quickly, there are only 2 things in existance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emanations, which exist forever and can&amp;#39;t be changed or created.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And awareness that makes some glow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emanation exist in the dark sea of awareness.

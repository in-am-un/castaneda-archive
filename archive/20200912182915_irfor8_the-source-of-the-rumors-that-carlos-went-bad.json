I still get private messages about this crazy story.\n\nHopefully that's where Felix got his con.  I'd like to think he didn't make that up himself.\n\nAnd it's become a \"badge of honor\" for hot-shot Castaneda inventory experts who plague this subreddit.  They say stuff like, \"Carlos went bad, I don't follow him. I follow don Juan!  And he visits me in dreaming to give me special techniques to share with all of you!\"\n\nI can't underestimate the damage this has done.\n\nI suppose the made-up myth even included some mysterious dark realm that bad sorcerers can escape to.\n\nNaturally there's no such realm mentioned in Carlo's books.  You have to have a container.\n\nSo you either go to the IOBs world to live longer, rearrange your emanations to be more like them, but you'll barely exist here  and will still die relatively soon.\n\nOr you burn from within.\n\nWe don't seem to have the choice to travel around as just awareness, minus a container.\n\nWhy did Howard do it?\n\nI suppose the implication, also false, is that it happened towards the end.\n\nSo not only did Howard spread false information, but he potentially enhanced it with non-truths.\n\nCarlos did have a problem. But it was that he was starting to burn with the fire from withing, which means, he was on the verge of the 3rd attention, like it or not.\n\nTaisha definitely didn't like it.  I had a short conversation with her about it.  She was seriously worried they'd be left alone.\n\nAs for Howard claiming it happened at the end, I suspect that's \"book deal thinking\".\n\nHis fame was Carlos' books.\n\nThat's best enhanced if Carlos was good, until the end.\n\nBut it's an inaccurate portrayal of the situation.  As long ago as 20 years before Carlos died, Howard was warning young women that Carlos was, \"a bad man\".  He told them to stay away.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhat is this \"light of life\" that Howard teaches?  The impression everyone is given is that he \"discovered it\".\n\nIn fact, it's just Daoism.\n\nHe found a life extending technique.  His confidence he'll live to 150 (he told me so), probably comes from Chinese literature.\n\nI hope he does, but there's a big problem with Daoism.\n\nAnd one which excuses Howard for his beliefs about Carlos.\n\nHe was being righteous, in a Chinese way.\n\nOriginally, Daoism came from the Akkadians. They noticed that if you mix the dried pods of wild poppies with new wine, you could extract the opiates.  Morphine and Codeine primarily.\n\nUsing that drink,  they discovered what they called, \"The Dao\".\n\nAnd then they moved north into China.\n\nThey were sorcerers, pure and simple.  And from a time when magical texts were widely available.\n\nTexts we no longer have.\n\nThey also came from an area where the religion of the day prevailed. Always evolving through story telling, and not through facts,  they undoubtedly brought a lot of baggage with them to China.\n\nThat original Daoism probably was quite different from what we have now.\n\nIn China, it was tamed. It became a business of rituals and spells.\n\nI was explaining what Howard had been telling people to the Taiwanese Bosses' son, who has a much deeper understanding of the cultural significance of such things.\n\nWe in the west are clueless.  People exaggerate Chinese information, to make themselves feel more important.\n\nBut back home, everyone knows the local Daoist priest is a child molester. He even goes out in public with 2 little boys, given to him by a poor family.  He's never exposed because of Asian culture, and because the 2 little boys are given a franchise, in which they can earn a living when they grow up.\n\nThe same happens at the Buddhist temple, with male's given to the temple controlling the prostitution around the temple once they grow up.\n\nThe Taiwanese Bosses' son told me, there's something going on here I can't understand.\n\nI wish I could remember the precise details.  He's not big on explaining to that level.\n\nHe pronounced Tao for me.  In Chinese.\n\nIn one pronunciation it simply meant, \"the path\".\n\nBut by altering a tiny thing no western ear can hear, it becomes, \"the path with morals\".\n\nInstead of the voice going up in the middle of the word, it goes down. Or levels off.\n\nI still can't hear it.  I can only hear that the two are obviously the same word, but one sounds different.\n\nAnd so Daoism, which was originally sorcery, became associated with Chinese morals.\n\nA priest is supposed to possess those also.  It's not enough to have magic.  You have to behave properly.\n\nAnd there's the problem Howard has with Carlos.\n\nHis behavior was not aesthetically pleasing to a Chinese man.\n\nIf that sounds unlikely, just remember our recent sustained action visitor, saying that Carlos was \"sewing chaos\" wherever he went.\n\nSo?\n\nThat's how you get people's assemblage points loose. Take them out of cozy, and put them in unfamiliar.\n\nWhat did he want? For Carlos to run a stray women shelter?\n\nIt's the same old shit!  Stuck in the river of filth, with the people around you pulling you back towards the middle of it all.\n\nSomewhere I posted Cholita's rendition of the river of filth.\n\nAside from her crumpled body on the shore, with a dinosaur stepping on her (me), she has a boat floating over the suffering crowds, run by people with funny hats.\n\nThat's the Daoists. Buddhists. Christians.  Politicians.\n\nRiding over the filth, profiting from it.\n\nAnd condemning anyone who tries to escape.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Source of the Rumors that Carlos Went Bad", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_irfor8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1599931871.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1599928155.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that the source of the rumors that Carlos went bad, is Howard Lee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;John Daniels was taking his classes, the same as Cholita, and Howard explained it to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daniel&amp;#39;s, hosting 3 &amp;quot;pro-Castaneda&amp;quot; web sites, passed the rumor around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Endless damage was done to the community.

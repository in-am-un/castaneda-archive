If you look around honestly, that becomes obvious. For starters, try Wikipedia, but you won't be familiar with the names mentioned, so it takes a bit more than that to understand the origins.\n\nBut some have chosen to believe it as an act of religious faith.  Because life hurts, and they're frightened in many cases.   Mental illness is common among those interested in such things.\n\nAnd religion really sucks!  It's a parasite on society, which serves some tiny useful purpose, but in the end keeps people from actual happiness.\n\nIt's a pitiful substitute for the magic we lost, when we took up agriculture.\n\nWorse, it's easy to fake up your own reincarnation memory and go around boasting to your friends about it.\n\nYou become a mini Victor Sanchez, who has endless books on \"Toltec Sorcery\", and can't afford to admit he was  a fraud all along.  Even though it's become more and more obvious each day.\n\nReincarnation enthusiasts are in that boat.  It's either fist fight, or admit they were fooled. Or worse, that they lied to others.\n\nWhen crossed, they're likely to tell themselves they're standing up for the Buddha, the wisest man in history.\n\nExcept, he wasn't...  And that only angers them more.\n\nWith the type of raging internal dialogue it takes to uphold religious beliefs, it's not out of the question they'd get into a physical fight to defend their beliefs.\n\nCarlos had to have bodyguards.  I've even been threatened.\n\nSure, most will just brush it off once they realize it's not true, and even makes no sense.\n\nBut to realize that they need to learn enough sorcery to actually travel around other realities.\n\nIn other words, they need to become more powerful than the people they are clinging to, who are telling them there's such a thing as reincarnation.\n\nCarlos fought against 2 very sinister forces in private classes.\n\nOf the two, belief in reincarnation was the most dangerous.\n\nHe was obviously worried when he tried to take it on.\n\nFrom what I've learned over time, worried not only about losing students (unlike this subreddit, he had a limited supply), but worried about physical violence.\n\nTypically he'd leave the topic alone, unless we had \"important\" visitors from Europe.  Who had to go home soon.\n\nThey're obsessed with reincarnation over there.  Maybe the proximity to India increases it.\n\nHe'd gently try to point out it was a silly idea, but as far as I know, he never succeeded.\n\nThey were \"better than everyone\" because they had their own reincarnation stories. So even if they didn't understand sorcery, it doesn't matter.\n\nThey were already halfway to their \"goal\".\n\nThey were \"Book Deal Mind Zombies\".\n\nThe other topic he battled was Catholicism.\n\nCatholicism is a bit harder to battle, because any sorcerer can travel to view God and Heaven, as often as he likes. So he can't say it's not true.\n\nJust point out the inconsistencies, and try to convince people, even if there was Heaven, it's not a very nice place to live.\n\nWhen a sorcerer travels to \"past lives\",  he quickly learns they are not.\n\nThey're cyclic beings, and the delusions about being back in time, or whatever other \"evidence\" reincarnation fans come up with, turns out to be a tiny bit of a shapeshifting hangover.\n\nStay on the rusty old tracks...

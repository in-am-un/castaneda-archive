Raw footage, right from Rokoko's capture suit. \n\nThat's why she checks the computer. \n\nIt was never named. I created the name because it as such a serious loss to no longer be taught anywhere.  I hoped to encourage Cleargreen to bring it back, by giving it a name.\n\nBut they preferred to make up new passes, and not tell us where they came from.\n\nAs if we couldn't count the time since Carlos was gone.\n\nIt was the first pass Carlos taught in the first private class I attended, in late 1994.\n\nI don't know how long others had been there in class, but not long.\n\nUnless you want to go back to the 1980s, when Carlos thought he could teach in public for free, in parks near Dance Home.\n\nHe couldn't.  \n\nHad the same problem we have in here.\n\nBad men come to heckle, and establish themselves as \"the new nagual\".\n\nThat led to workshops with locked doors and armed guards, a need to charge money, and then to \"private classes\" so that promising people (and beautiful young women) didn't have to pay money to get continuous instruction.\n\nThe thing about Zuleica's pass is, it's not obvious what you are doing.\n\nThe hips rotate, but they also sway left and right.\n\nAnd the hands \"flick\" at the end.\n\nI fantasize that if you had a broom attached to  your navel, you'd be sweeping the floor with it.\n\nJadey theorizes that you are sweeping the energy off the \"me spot\" between the toes.\n\nAnd I theorized that the \"flick\" of the fingers would push the accumulated purple puffs towards the center.  To teach the energy body to stay closer to our tonal energy.\n\nI believed this pass is the same as Zuleica teaching Carlos to sweep the floor with his tentacles.\n\nWhich by the way, you can FULLY feel. It's amazing.  Except your waking mind can't comprehend that you have a tentacle coming from your midsection, and instead makes it seem as if your foot, or your hand, was literally touching the floor.\n\nCompletely,  perfectly tactile.  Can't tell it from the real thing.\n\nEXCEPT, your hand is not on the floor.  And your foot isn't brushing over it like that.\n\nThe results of this magical pass in the deep red zone are SPECTACULAR!!!!\n\nNot only do the puffs comes out to play and swirl, as it encourages your energy body to swarm around you.  But it's clearly the precursor to forming the \"impersonal blue ball of energy\" body.\n\nMy guess is, long before you form that \"blue ball\" energy body and then shrink your tonal to ride along in it, and take off for the Forbidden Palace in China (the sights of which I have memorized for help traveling there), your energy body will \"swarm\".\n\nSometimes in the middle of the night, to wake you up to practice darkroom.\n\nBut I can't afford to add special effects to this animation right now.  While the movement is so awkward. And my skills to fix it, too poor.\n\nCarlos was standing not 5 feet from me up at the front of the class when he taught it, on the mirrored wall that leads to the stairs down.\n\nI'm one of those annoying autistic kids in high school science class, who keeps asking very detailed questions about the exploding sodium metal demo.  \n\nBoth pleasing the old chemistry teacher, and annoying him at the same time.\n\nWhat the other students don't realize, as they wish I'd shut up, is that I manufactured some lithium metal at home. Using molten liquid lithium salts in a clay crucible.\n\nIt's easier to make than raw sodium...\n\nBut how to get it to explode like that in water?  Lithium metal tends to just fizzle.\n\nSo there I was up at the front of the class, when Carlos showed it.\n\nAnd then, knowing I was up there to ask too many questions, Carlos put pressure on me by making me the first to \"do it for him\", while he watched up close.\n\nHe didn't correct me in any way. He just raised his eyebrows, as if I'd missed something.\n\nI kept trying and trying, each time increasing the flick of the hands, or the rotation of the hips, or the back and forth movement.\n\nTrying anything to see if he was pleased.\n\nBut he just shook his head very mildly, like \"it needs work\", and moved on to the beautiful young woman behind me in the class lineup.\n\n  \nProbably Virginia.\n\nThe beautiful young women who hadn't yet cut their hair, but were feeling \"inappropriate advances\" by Carlos, often hid behind me.\n\nCarlos would walk over to them to see how they did it, and his hands tended to end up on their shoulders.\n\nHe liked to make everyone worry in private classes.\n\nThe same way don Juan had Taisha believing he wanted to rape her late at night in her bedroom at Zuleica's compound.\n\nOnly to find out, it was the Ally of don Juan which was after her.\n\nNot don Juan himself.\n\nHe just put young Taisha \"ill at ease\" so that the ally could appear for her.\n\nNever judge sorcerers by common standards!\n\nSure... \n\nCarlos was a big pervert.  Like Julian.\n\nBut I have to say, from Cholita I've learned you can't separate beautiful young women from their perceived source of power.\n\nTheir desirability.\n\nIf you just get them to give in, you enlist them for real. Instead of them just hanging out to see what they can gain while they check out the other men in class, looking for a \"spiritual boyfriend\" to live with.\n\nDid I mention, Carlos was in fact a bit of a womanizer??\n\nHoward of all people, complained about it to the daughter of Marshall Ho'o, as a warning to stay away from \"that bad man\" Carlos.  Who always had a different young woman under his arm.\n\nBut in fact, Carlos did that \"for the common good\".\n\nLike his grandfather I suppose.  \n\nGo find that story.  \n\nSome bad player tried to use that \"horrible story\" to prove Carlos was a fraud.\n\nProbably a Kachora zombie trying to make us all give up so he could take over as \"Tata's Senpai\" when the old guy dies.  The magic in here, greatly threatens that pretend sorcery franchise.\n\nIn private classes, Carlos created \"factions\".  \n\nBy which class you got to attend (there were at least 3).  \n\nBy where you stood.  \n\nBy who it was ok to talk to.\n\nHe gave rise to \"Faction #3\", which is the muse of this subreddit. Only 3 of us left now, out of perhaps 200.  Cholita says, just 100.\n\nTypically the \"Sunday class\" arrangement had the Chacmools guarding the witches and Carol, who would be to his left while he addressed the class.  They hid so well, sometimes you weren't even sure if the senior witches were there at all.\n\nEveryone else stood in dance home proper.  As \"the class\".\n\nHere's a picture:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/klyp1c7hre5b1.jpg?width=964&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3160d492c8a993a2c2689a75b6ed137c786d62a3\n\nCarlos and the \"inner circle\" on the right, with \"the class students\" out there up to the windows.\n\nCholita says, it was around 50 people when it was \"full\".  Seems right to me too. But which 50 varied, and \"honored guests\" got to hide with the witches up at the front.\n\nAfter Carlos finished teaching that pass, which was one of the \"single movement\" passes he taught for weeks before he decided it wasn't working well and created the \"long forms\" KungFu style, to gain the help of our \"muscle memory\" to help stop us from fantasizing while doing passes, someone in the audience, likely Felix, asked the merchant mind question.\n\n\"How many of these passes do we need?\"\n\nCarlos didn't answer fast enough. \n\nHe had a crooked slight grin on his face, and looked over to the senior witches.\n\nNo one spoke. \n\nIt was a pretty horrible question.\n\nElis finally spoke up from her hiding place near the witches. To break the awkward silence.\n\n\"One?\"\n\nCarlos didn't disagree. He just removed his weird grin and taught us the next pass.\n\nZuleica's pass first teaches the energy body to swarm.\n\nThen the sweeping motion makes your tentacle body visible.\n\nAnd your \"shrunk\" tonal starts to be obvious.\n\nAlthough, I haven't seen enough to understand if that's really what we turn our organic body into, when we switch to our doubles.\n\nTechno suggested, you start to see your physical body the way the double sees it.\n\nWhich, don't forget, is completely impossible.\n\nThe room is pitch black!\n\nBut there it is anyway, and you soon forget you shouldn't be able to see anything at all!\n\nInstead, you want to see more, and feel frustrated it won't keep mutating until you get a clearer view.\n\nSpoiled we can become, by too many visions of \"the force\"...  \n\nSpeaking like Yoda of course.  \n\nBut it's true.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Zuleica's Pass Raw", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 60, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"klyp1c7hre5b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 46, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/klyp1c7hre5b1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac480b96dd04931d30b0e034af8278f4411c0341"}, {"y": 93, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/klyp1c7hre5b1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4022ed709fef39c9a65e6155c09ddae2774f9233"}, {"y": 138, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/klyp1c7hre5b1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cedcc2ec3518d45a4d25d3ea2dca95966a815e9"}, {"y": 276, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/klyp1c7hre5b1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cc0137dea1eba27ea1c9237e898c7ce0631d414"}, {"y": 415, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/klyp1c7hre5b1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d1630ddc56f6b126a6ee6517f98d8254908b3ea"}], "s": {"y": 417, "x": 964, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/klyp1c7hre5b1.jpg?width=964&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3160d492c8a993a2c2689a75b6ed137c786d62a3"}, "id": "klyp1c7hre5b1"}, "1jbr52g9oe5b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/146xqx8/asset/1jbr52g9oe5b1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718049631%2CMDhlMTVhYTIwM2Y5YmQ0NmNjNjRiMmEyMjViNmMxNTU1MzNiNjk3OTIxZGRhYzc3MTA5NzVhNWQ2Yzg4ZTg3Zg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 1080, "y": 1080, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/146xqx8/asset/1jbr52g9oe5b1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718049631%2CMDQwMDk0NTY4YWRiNjYwY2UyNDkwY2U1ZTNlM2U3NTI5ZTlkYzk0OTZlZmQwMjNjNDg4NWJkODI5YWEzNzQ5YQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "1jbr52g9oe5b1", "isGif": false}}, "name": "t3_146xqx8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 32, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 32, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/43JZHeB4lsdm5hoNMEtDzR4TMsjVQHqQsUTcUydShiU.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1686499634.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/146xqx8/video/1jbr52g9oe5b1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/146xqx8/video/1jbr52g9oe5b1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose raw is better than nothing!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People were saying in chat, they weren&amp;#39;t confident they got it right from the still picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s Zuleica&amp;#39;s pass.

This is magic&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Off come the clothes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Works like a charm if they believe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not on Cholita though...   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her permission depends on the height and eye color of who&amp;#39;s taking the pictures, and how long it&amp;#39;s been since he shaved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s just the photography lights bouncing off the insides of the tiny specs of water in the air, collecting enough light to be very bright points in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then interacting with what&amp;#39;s called, &amp;quot;lens flair&amp;quot;.  And a slow shutter speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result looks &amp;quot;magical&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One women took a picture of herself clearly naked, surrounded by &amp;quot;orbs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And got it to Carlos as an introduction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita would have to clarify that a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who took the picture to Carlos???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mailing it wouldn&amp;#39;t have been likely, since anyone would realize he gets endless letters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe, it was allowed for one inner circle woman to &amp;quot;sponsor&amp;quot; another new one.  If they could provide a place to stay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s nickname is because she was sponsored by a professional &amp;quot;Chola&amp;quot;.

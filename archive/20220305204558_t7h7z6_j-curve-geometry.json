All of you should be able to answer.\n\nSilence.  Otherwise, it's hopeless.\n\nBut why?\n\nI don't expect you to see through the cracks (yet), but that answer should be obvious too.\n\nAll we have is our attention!  (\"Second Attention\").\n\nWhatever the attention focuses on, tunes in.  Becomes reality.\n\nOr technically, *intent* reskims to what we focused our attention on.\n\nUnfortunately, we developed a \"book mark\" for our reality.\n\nWe can't spend all day focusing our attention desperately, trying to prevent our reality from changing too often.\n\nSo something created the internal dialogue.\n\nIt's a \"doing\" to hold our position.\n\nBut it's a really UGLY thing if you think about it.\n\nThis picture shows you what happens if you can control your attention.  And to control it, you must focus it on  a very limited range.  Like a \"beam\" in front of you.\n\nBut our internal dialogue focuses it on what someone said 30 years ago.\n\nHow dare he???\n\nOr it focuses on how much trouble you're in today, because you are late for work.\n\nOr on those pesky Russians, shelling your city.\n\nI suppose, some things need you to focus on them...\n\nBut only when it's useful!  Not all the time, endlessly.\n\nAll the time doesn't make you more alert. It makes you LESS alert.\n\nThis picture shows you a 3 step process for focusing your attention, to learn what that means.\n\nNormally in darkroom, we follow the path Carlos gave us.\n\nThe tricky devil actually implanted it in the minds of his private class students.  He did it with his actions, which included some \"not so obvious\" intending.\n\nSome pantomime.    Some unreasonable expectations he induced in us.\n\nAnd with the Tensegrity.\n\nSo if you find yourself in the darkroom, putting in enough time to learn to be silent for real, you'll eventually be able to play with puffs of color.\n\nAnd you DO need to scoop those onto your \"energy pouches\".  Or if you don't know what those are, the right side of your stomach, the left side, and a smear across your chest.\n\nLook at it!  If you can't see them stay there, you aren't silent enough.\n\nKeep it up!\n\nWhen the assemblage point finally moves all the way to the bottom, you can even \"gaze\" into the purple puffs, now stuck to your pouches, and see a little flurry.  Some twinkles.  Maybe a zig zag. Or a line.\n\nINSIDE the pouches, now glowing on your torso, you will see \"details\".\n\nYou are now officially in the deep red zone.  Down at the bottom.\n\nHere is where you can get into big trouble.  But this post isn't about that.\n\nAnd besides, it's far better to get stuck in \"the shift below\", than to be an idiot living in the river of filth, worrying about how to manipulate other people, in order to get attention for yourself.\n\nSo don't worry too much about getting stuck.\n\nMaybe a couple of times is even ok.\n\nTo get stuck, you follow this diagram.\n\nSee a purple puff?  Can you move it around in your hand?\n\nIt is super bright?\n\nIs there jet black swirling around it?\n\nThen you can use this diagram.\n\nGrab both sides, and \"stretch it\" horizontally.\n\nYou *saw* it.\n\nNow **do something** with it.\n\nYour assemblage point will begin to shift horizontally, to make that possible.\n\nBy finding the puff in the first place, you moved your assemblage point down.  There's no puffs up at the top!  But gazing off \"into the distance\" you noticed one.  And kept doing your tensegrity and forcing silence, until it got bright enough to be interesting.\n\nAnd please make sure to stuff them on your pouches.\n\nIf you keep forgetting to do that, it indicates a misunderstanding about what we are trying to do.\n\nWe aren't trying to impress other people.  We aren't trying to imitate a shroom trip.\n\nWe're trying to follow a very specific path.\n\nStuffing the puffs, brings out the double.\n\nWho has FAR more power than you do.\n\nSo you try another \"doing\".  Puff stuffing, is a \"doing\" which brings out the double.\n\nTry \"stretching\" the puff,  once you have \"double assistance\", which will set an anchor at that depth of the assemblage point.\n\nAnd indicate you are willing it to move your assemblage point sideways.\n\nDid it stretch?\n\nThat's *intent*.\n\nIf you can see that it stretched, you have controlled *intent*.\n\nThat's cycle #1.    *See*, Do, *Intend*.\n\n*Intend* = recognize.\n\nSo now what?\n\nI tried it just 2 nights ago, to make sure it still works.\n\nLay the stretched puff in the air, and \"*see*\" that it's there.\n\nNow rub your hand on the right edge, and smear it to the end of your darkroom.  DO that.\n\nNow recognize.  See the result of your *intending*.  Does half of it now stretch to the wall?\n\nGood.  That's iteration #2.\n\nRepeat on the left side.\n\nAnd recognize what it has become.\n\nIt's a road!\n\nYou now have a purple streak across your room. If you keep gazing at it, as a road, it'll start to take on \"road details\".\n\nBut don't.  Grab it and toss it up above your dark room, to form a freeway overpass.  Or some other \"doing\" that makes sense to you.\n\nI toss it like a sheet I want to spread over the bed. Fling it out and up, so it catches air, and gently floats down onto the bed, flat (ish).\n\nUse the \"doing\" of \"making the bed\" to produce a freeway over pass above your darkroom.\n\nGaze to make sure it's very high above your ceiling.\n\nIf you can see that now, you just *intended* a compound task.   That took \"steps\".\n\nRemind you of turning into a crow?  From the books.\n\nSame process!\n\nIf you can erect a freeway over pass above your room, you don't need more suggestions from me.\n\nHowever, the puffs are fickle.\n\nThey aren't always there, even if you have moved your assemblage point past the bottom.\n\nThey come and go.\n\nSo a simpler \"Y, X, Z\" technique.\n\nGazing in silence at the darkness, which might include some whitish light on the walls, find a \"sparkle\".\n\nDull is ok!  As long as you can honestly say, \"Yep, there's a disturbance there, even if it's nearly invisible\", you're good to go.\n\nStick your fingers in it, and wiggle them.\n\n\"Add energy\" to it.\n\nRemove hand, and watch to see the result.\n\nYou'll be surprised how reliably that works.\n\nSo you did iteration #1.\n\nIf you feel like it, blow into it.  Or hum to it.  Or even sing.\n\nSee if that worked too.\n\nMany \"doings\" are possible. Find some that make it brighter and more \"real\".\n\nThen reach your fingers into the middle of it, and stretch it \"open\".\n\nAnd look inside!\n\nHere's where you can get into trouble.\n\nIf you've been doing this Y, X, Z technique all night long, you might look in there and see another world, and get sucked right inside!\n\nWithout having *intended* to go in.\n\nNormally, you are in control of this 3 step process.\n\nBut there's conscious forces out there.\n\nIt's almost as if, after a while, *intent* itself *intends* a choice for you.\n\nOne you didn't expect.\n\nI have a suspicion.\n\nIt's just a theory.\n\nThe Eagle likes to watch.\n\nBut he gets \"engrossed\".\n\nWhile he's watching you stretch a flurry of lights open in the air, he thinks to his Eagleness, wouldn't it be super cool if he pulled open a portal and exited his room through it?\n\nThen he thinks to himself, \"Didn't that old fat nagual at the cenote do things like that?\n\nHe remembers the old fat nagual, and the scene comes up for him,  the same way a scene comes up for you, in Silent Knowledge.\n\nBut the scene causes the emanations in your room to glow, and you get sucked in. The same way the old fat Nagual did.\n\nIn fact, I suspect if you could replay both side by side, and watch them in sync, you'd notice that the old fat nagual's left foot twisted left a bit, as he zipped through a hole in reality.\n\nAnd sure enough, your left foot twisted also.\n\nThat's the \"abstract core\" effect.\n\nJust a theory.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "J Curve Geometry", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Games"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"krmlxgwayml81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/krmlxgwayml81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac178d9c3b3e140092a7356019e91490371c0de3"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/krmlxgwayml81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d12d2db0a58fb31f2e427f96bbf32f6deea26f"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/krmlxgwayml81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d5a1cfd26ddfd76441945a9de423474584b0023"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/krmlxgwayml81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6d546516ff05db35cd25e7adaf74d53f08d9777"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/krmlxgwayml81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41d22b6584aab8f67f0df7c1f6f58e6b446991e4"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/krmlxgwayml81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bd64b437b62c2b7d7830725c371f49f0be1ef81"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/krmlxgwayml81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3693265f1417d55489b63ef7ad49f7078ed3c1b"}, "id": "krmlxgwayml81"}}, "name": "t3_t7h7z6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Games", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/BfO1mzt5K7uNyJg3ZTUAowh2Kgk5PQzTaiAsYWfrjLY.jpg", "edited": 1646518608.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1646509558.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/krmlxgwayml81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a3693265f1417d55489b63ef7ad49f7078ed3c1b\"&gt;Almost didn&amp;#39;t put this in the public subreddit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how do you make this work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Come on...

Find some that make it brighter and more &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then reach your fingers into the middle of it, and stretch it &amp;quot;open&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And look inside!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s where you can get into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve been doing this Y, X, Z technique all night long, you might look in there and see another world, and get sucked right inside!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without having &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; to go in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally, you are in control of this 3 step process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s conscious forces out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s almost as if, after a while, &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; itself &lt;em&gt;intends&lt;/em&gt; a choice for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One you didn&amp;#39;t expect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Eagle likes to watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he gets &amp;quot;engrossed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While he&amp;#39;s watching you stretch a flurry of lights open in the air, he thinks to his Eagleness, wouldn&amp;#39;t it be super cool if he pulled open a portal and exited his room through it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he thinks to himself, &amp;quot;Didn&amp;#39;t that old fat nagual at the cenote do things like that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He remembers the old fat nagual, and the scene comes up for him,  the same way a scene comes up for you, in Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the scene causes the emanations in your room to glow, and you get sucked in. The same way the old fat Nagual did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, I suspect if you could replay both side by side, and watch them in sync, you&amp;#39;d notice that the old fat nagual&amp;#39;s left foot twisted left a bit, as he zipped through a hole in reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And sure enough, your left foot twisted also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;abstract core&amp;quot;

It's not necessary any more,\" he answered me. \"A long time has passed from all that.\"\n\nWith respect to Europe, Castaneda's impression was final. \"There's nothing there,\" he insisted. \"Europe is finished; everything is dead. You can notice it even in the landscape. The Alps don't have anything over Colorado! Europe lacks the strength that America has.\"\n\nWith respect to Italy, he was particularly convincing. \"The landscape is as if a miniature. There everything is organized and very civilized. A little hill here, a little house there. There's no strength! In Italy, you're either a Communist or a Catholic. There's nothing else.\"\n\nHe made us understand that in Europe there's nothing but old ideologies, dichotomies from other eras. Castaneda, on the other hand, moves on a very different plane than that of politics of religions. In his universe, there's no space for traditional ways of seeing and judging.\n\nJust before entering the campus, Castaneda turned around, and taking my forearm and hands said to me, \"Ma'am, you don't know how grateful I am that you've introduced me to your friends.\" His words were very intense and thrilled me. It possibly indicates that he was grateful to me for the fact that I might have behaved well as intermediary, as a bridge between my friends and him.\n\nWhen we arrived at the parking lot, we all bade a friendly farewell and separated. Castaneda walked toward the corner and disappeared behind the tall shrubs of the street. It would have been around eleven p.m. We got in the car, and undertook the return trip. The two hours turned out to be short. We had been very impressed and there wasn't enough time for us to say all that the encounter of that evening had stored up in us.\n\nThat evening Castaneda paid great attention to distinguishing and clarifying that which he had proven and is capable of experimenting, to that which the others say and do. He told us that he had spent 17 years in the task of learning. During all that time, there are things that he has been able to experiment with and verify by himself, others which he is learning, and others that even he hasn't incorporated into his life. So, for example, he has been able to verify the Toltec way of eating and sleeping.\n\nHe has also incorporated the art of dreaming, even though he still needs the help of la Gorda. With respect to other phenomena, it was evident that he didn't want to speak much, and time and time again he had to confess that there are things he doesn't understand. Moreover, there are many things that he doesn't think will ever be possible to understand. Castaneda, however, trusts Don Juan and his teaching; he trusts in that which he doesn't understand nor has obtained explanations: More than once Don Juan has demonstrated to him that the Toltecs made sense, and in consequence, trusted that it had to make sense to the end.\n\nThe memory of that evening has remained like a clearly delineated picture in which the fascinating figure of Castaneda occupies all the space. All the phantasmagoria and prodigies in his books\u2014as Octavio Paz says\u2014that I so many times had put in doubt and that with certain disgust had considered as an unnecessary display of freaks, were made perfectly credible and possible after knowing Castaneda.\n\nBeyond the facts he narrated, you discover the essential truth of his affirmations. After all...what is more difficult than to fry hamburgers all day like Joe Cordoba with his eyes full of smoke?\n\n*Graciela Corvalan, Ph.D. is a professor of Spanish at Webster University in St. Louis, Missouri.

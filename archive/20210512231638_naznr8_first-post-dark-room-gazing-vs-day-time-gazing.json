Its head was a horse&amp;#39;s skull, except dripping from the crown of its head down its face was blood and blackened, burnt clots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It stood over me and laughed and took delight as I felt some of the most intense pains I have ever felt in my life. I couldn&amp;#39;t say from here whether the pain was because of how sick I was, and it was just laughing at that, or whether it was causing the pain somehow. It certainly wasn&amp;#39;t laughing the whole time. Like a psychopath who laughs and then stops suddenly and shows anger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember not being scared, but instead incredibly angry. I could not reach out and grab it, and if I could, I would have fought it to the death.

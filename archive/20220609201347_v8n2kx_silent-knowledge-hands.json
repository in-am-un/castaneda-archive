But if they are, you should still try to read it.\n\nRight now your mind is FILLED with crap magic.  Garbage.\n\nHoly Guardian Angels, Past lives, Silver Chords.\n\nLies made up by greedy men.\n\nI suppose you can't remove that nonsense. I seriously doubt you could convince any beginner that it \"matters\", and get them to recapitulate every place they ever picked up such make believe.\n\nMost will get angry at even the idea that their \"vast knowledge of spiritual topics\" is going to weigh them down to the bottom of the ocean, like cement shoes.\n\nEven though it was originally designed by bad people to do just that.\n\nIf you have all the true examples of magic, and reality, from the books of Carlos and the witches, at least you have some \"real alternatives\".\n\nAnd perhaps the real thing can drown out the fake stuff?  \n\nA good example is Juann's post, where he \"assembled\" candyland outdoors.\n\nHe hints that maybe it's because he saw that in the past.\n\nOr maybe he's hinting, that's the closest picture he could find on google images, and wanted to let you know not to take that literally.\n\nEither way there's a deep secret in that.\n\nANY awareness you focus in the world, is actually focused on superstrings of awareness carrying dark matter across infinity.\n\nDark because, on its own it's invisible.\n\nBut when your awareness lights it up, because you \"looked at it\", it leaves a glow.\n\nForever.\n\nI suppose it fades with time, but it's still there.\n\nSo let's say you were standing in a perfectly dark room, looking ahead, and somehow you could COMPLETELY remove your internal dialogue.\n\nAnd you had absolutely no wants or desires.\n\nAnd no expectations.\n\nYou aren't focusing ANY of your awareness on anything, other than that you're looking into the darkness, in silence, to see what materializes.\n\nThat's where the crap you picked up in the past starts to matter.\n\nSo if you loved Candyland as a kid, and you're gazing into the darkness, the slightest \"whiff\" of candy in the air, is a guaranteed visit to candyland.\n\nFor real. It'll materialize in front of you.\n\nAn illusion?\n\nThat depends on how much dreaming energy you have. On a good day, you could walk in there and gorge yourself.\n\nI don't recommend it. That's technically a severe horizontal shift of the assemblage point.\n\nBut if you don't eat any, you can walk in there fairly safely with very little horizontal shifting.\n\n\"Horizontal shifting\" is bad, because that's \"sleeping dreaming\" territory. Unconsciousness, even if you remain fully awake.\n\nIt means, insteaf of moving down on your back, your \"assemblage point\" moved right 6 inches, or left 6 inches. It's no longer \"centered\".\n\nSave that for later.  AMAZING things happen in those 6 inches right or left. 10,000 worlds at each level on that J curve diagram.\n\nBut we need to \"stay in the middle\" of that J curve, for easiest movement along that path.\n\nSo implant the \"good versions of Candyland\" in your mind.  The ones DESIGNED by sorcerers to be helpful to you.  The ones in those 17 books and publications.  Perhaps it's actually 18.\n\nAnd would you please get over your \"vast magical knowledge\"...\n\nYou have none. It's just delusions about candyland.  Not  even a tiny bit useful unless you're playing that game.\n\nOtherwise, what I say wouldn't anger you.\n\nAnger means, fake magic.\n\nAnger over a \"slight\" to your tonal (yourself) is blue line stuff.  Up at the top, before there's even the weak green line effects of shamanic drumming or meditation.\n\nThis diagram shows some of the real magic you get, right in your face, eyes open, completely sober, fully awake, if you follow the instructions in this subreddit.\n\nAnd the Buddha himself never got past the first picture series for any sustained duration. He might have accidentally stumbled into the second set of pictures, the red zone, but it was likely just too much curry, and he probably fell asleep anyway.   He woke up confused, and the scribes turned it into another magical adventure.\n\nSince he was too lazy to open his eyes or move around, he didn't have access to even the red zone.\n\nBut if you do \"the real thing\", designed over THOUSANDS OF UNINTERRUPTED YEARS, BACK BEFORE MONEY AND GREED, you will get \"pulled\" by the latent glow of awareness from the ancient Olmecs.\n\nThey also had their \"candyland\",  but theirs was REAL. It wasn't designed by Hasbro in the 60s.\n\nOr even by a con man 3000 years ago.\n\nIt was from before there was any reason at all to make up stuff.\n\nThe silence removes your insistence on remaining up at the blue part of that J shape.\n\nWhere all of the world currently resides. Any memory, fantasy, or worry about your life, past or present, is entirely at that blue line.  It makes no sense in the other positions, so if you are thinking it, you are being pulled back to that blue line.\n\nIn silence, you can drift down.\n\nThe position of your assemblage point becomes fully visible, out in the purple zone.\n\nBut before that, you might pick up the yellowish glow.\n\nI made this picture really just to show a new \"darkroom game\".\n\n\"Waif manipulation\".\n\nIt's a purple zone only ability as far as I know.\n\nYou aren't manipulating the \"waifs\" with your hands.\n\nOr even with your gaze.\n\nYou manipulate them by \"knowing\".\n\nAt that position of the assemblage point, what you \"know\" pulls out latent awareness in the emanations.\n\nIt isn't anything you put there.\n\nYou're just \"finding\" it there, by \"knowing\" it has to be out there. So it glows, and adds to the reality skimmed for you by intent.\n\nI couldn't afford the time to draw it right, but the hands are made entirely of fuzz.  1-2 inch white fragments of emanations.\n\nIn the palms, are the \"lines in the  hand\" that don Juan told us about.\n\nSome of those \"will\" tentacles, such as Genaro used to cling to the rock over the waterfall.\n\nIt's big time \"bad ass\" topic, so please, control your book deal mind.  Forget about using the dantien fake magic of the chinese, to discover your \"will\", so you can impress people on waterfalls.\n\nWe had a guy like that.  His head exploded after a week or to of pretending to be a \"comrade\".\n\nBut he was just mentally ill and wanted to make up stuff and steal money.\n\nThose guys often focus on \"the will\".\n\nThe \"lines in the hands\" are not sturdy enough for that sort of thing anyway.\n\nBut they become fully visible, in the orange zone.\n\nUse the claw hand movement.  It should be elsewhere in the wiki.\n\nAnd be patient!  You have to get some of your own awareness into those emanations, before it'll be pleasant to look at.\n\nIt's a \"forbidden sight\", so we block it out.\n\nEven if you are looking directly at the \"lines in the hands\", you'll disregard it. You'll almost have to kick yourself in the butt, if that were even possible, to get yourself to admit, yes.  You can see those lines.\n\nOnce you can see them, you can \"claw things\" out of the air.\n\nIt's like someone removed your hand and put a 3 pronged fork there instead.  Like Captain Hook the pirates hook hand, but with more hooks.  \n\nYou can scratch the darkness, and occasionally you'll hook something.\n\nJust be careful when you do.  You can gaze, but not \"into\" it.\n\nAnd don't touch it at all.\n\nSomething bad happened when Carlos did it, and so don Juan told him not to.\n\nBut you can!  We haven't been manipulated the way Carlos had.\n\nWe have protection.  \"The Shield of Doubt\".\n\nWe don't believe any of this crap!\n\nEven if we do.\n\nSo just don't touch the weird stuff you capture.\n\nBut I do recommend, if you see some \"waifs\" like those in the picture, you can make them dance for you.  Using the lines in the hands.\n\nBy \"knowing\", not by moving the hands.\n\nBut you probably need to \"release\" the knowing, with slight wiggles of the fingers.\n\nThen the waifs will dance for you.\n\nNo, not the band.\n\nI mean, the faint smoke drift spirits.  Sometimes people perceive them above swamps, in the moonlight.\n\nThey don't dance very well.  But it's still super cool to be in control of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Silent Knowledge Hands!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"yfikg824vm491": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yfikg824vm491.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d189688d7a315e447caa043ac9a10967a1bffd10"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yfikg824vm491.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffa9cc12beeb9f1ede029dca9f65ae09f1269202"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yfikg824vm491.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb95c1b3e61503ce600510622772efdcb0e588c9"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yfikg824vm491.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1ed86bd6820d5bb21709758fb5e2f119c627801"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yfikg824vm491.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d33109487521248f6136e4420db59eda46411d5"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yfikg824vm491.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66fc33cac09dfc576e8ca98d8aa75442d35fb552"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yfikg824vm491.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a404cfd4d034c03ce9d9f034f8f44efcb2c8fc7e"}, "id": "yfikg824vm491"}}, "name": "t3_v8n2kx", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tolCpzsdurF52rKCorUFyra-ZpgIgO-v_apA-1pexBA.jpg", "edited": 1654803886.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1654798427.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yfikg824vm491.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a404cfd4d034c03ce9d9f034f8f44efcb2c8fc7e\"&gt;All available to those who put in the time to practice darkroom!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sure would like to encourage all of you to read ALL of the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t imagine them being boring.

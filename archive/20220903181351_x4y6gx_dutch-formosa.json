Later, the Japanese too.\n\nNow one thing that shouldn't be said out loud is, when some imperialistic nations take over a country, and despite all the rapeing  and pillaging, the country usually has a better future.\n\nBetter roads, trains, police stations, schools.\n\nTaiwan was no different.\n\nThe dutch are long gone. They had their heyday around the 1620s.\n\nAnd the sheep were soon endangered.  I believe there might still be a few left.\n\nThe islander girls?\n\nActually they were fine with it.  It was local custom.\n\nCertainly nowhere near as bad as \"grove worship\" on which European moral values reside, in their distant past.  That custom sent all the virgins into the forest, and the men who could catch one got to have her.\n\nIt's from the bible!\n\nI was even offered an Islander girl myself, the last time I was on the tallest mountain there visiting with the owner of the tea farm.  Later I was told, it was the granddaughter of his \"secretary\".\n\nI could see the appeal!   She was amazing.\n\nBut that's not why I made the picture.\n\nI was sitting on the steps of On 8 in Bangkok a decade or more ago.  There was an orange cat that patrolled for rats. My hotel had adopted him as an \"outdoor pet\", as the Thai often do.\n\nYou even see dogs sleeping on blankets inside banks, if you walk down the street.\n\nAnd any food vendor with a stand will be supporting at least one stray, and 50 rats.\n\nThe orange cat was beloved by the hotel, and there were likely 1000 rats trying to get into the place every single day.  So he was well rewarded by the bartender, who worked just above where his little bed lay.\n\nShe \"made me an offer\".  If I kept coming back on business, she'd be my girlfriend if I paid her rent.\n\nThat's Thailand.  She probably had 2 other Euro-boyfriends, and at least one Aussie. Not to mention a lady boy on the side.\n\nI sat outside watching the orange cat \"chase rats\".\n\nIn slow motion.\n\nEven the rats waddled along in slow motion.\n\nIt's HOT in thailand.  And HUMID.\n\nIt's so bad, the men walk along the sidewalks with their arms held slightly out, so their armpits can dry off.  At first I thought they were trying to look like gangsters, which is common in Formosa.\n\nBut actually, it was just so hot that you either did that, or you had sweat dripping down the entire side of your shirt when you got to your business destination.\n\nAnd on the worst hot days there,  everyone moves very slowly.  Even the animals.\n\nI was watching the cat chase a rat down a sewer hole, neither seeming to be in a hurry, and I got to thinking \"what a lazy cat that is\".\n\nI guess it's \"ugly american\" syndrome.  Judging other places by our own way of life, which to be frank isn't all that wonderful once you get a chance to travel elsewhere.\n\nAs if to taunt me, I saw the cat walk over to the next 3 story building, just across the small street,  and leap up an entire floor.\n\nLiterally!\n\nThe cat just looked up to the next floor of a little apartment complex, gazed fiercely as he figured out his path, and lept what must have been a good 20 feet.\n\nLanding perfectly on the outside patio of one  of the apartments.\n\nI tried to figure out if it was a \"magical cat\" or something, but it looked like the cat simply knew where to put his paws on the way up, so that he kicked off some pipes, or wires I could barely see.\n\nI was thinking it was a fluke, when he lept up another story.\n\nThen he proceeded to tightrope walk between the 2 buildings. The apartments, and the On 8 Hotel.\n\nI was flabbergasted.\n\nBut not as much as I would be soon.\n\nI found myself in the tunnel Carol Tiggs had shown me in private classes.\n\nOne second I was looking out at a busy Thailand street, and the next I was inside the inorganic being's realm.\n\nOne of the Allies of Carlos was waiting.  This was back when I was still terrified of them.\n\nIt wanted to show me something.\n\n\"These are your leaders\", it said.\n\nSort of.  They don't actually speak, and yet you would swear they do.\n\nI glanced down the tunnel, and there were a series of paintings.  They reminded me of the tunnel with furrows Carlos described, saying you could select a furrow, gaze into it, and \"jump grooves\".\n\nHe was hoping to do that, and escape his cancer.\n\nThe key for him was, he needed more energetic mass.\n\nTeaching so many had drained him of energy, but he risked it in the hopes people would get to work, and build a mass of sorcery energy likely never seen before on earth.\n\nBut they didn't. So Carlos died.\n\nWhile in the tunnel, my interest was a bit juvenile.\n\nI wanted to see Loban's ship.\n\nLoban, the Chinese Daoist pirate who sailed to Mexico City, liked the sorcery there, and joined our lineage.\n\nI'd always fancied him as a kungfu master guarding a giant Chinese boat like you might see in a Bruce Lee movie. A shape rather weird to western eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[What I expected of Loban's ship, although bigger.](https://preview.redd.it/dygqlthc7ol91.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81166adf35045e953d79124e168599bfc225c462)\n\nSo I looked to see if any of the paintings were about Loban.\n\nThe ally said, \"I put it first, knowing you'd want to see that one most.\"\n\nI gazed into it, surprised.  I was pleased to see it rocking on the waves.\n\nThe painting was alive!\n\nI thought to myself, \"It's not a chinese boat at all!  How can that be?\"\n\nIt looked european to me.\n\nPerhaps, dutch?\n\nHere's where the \"magic cat\" lived.\n\nLong dead for sure.

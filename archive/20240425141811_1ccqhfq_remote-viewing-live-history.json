But I can explain it.\n\nThis shows what Silent Knowledge is like, when you view \"videos in the air\".\n\nNow don't worry... In case you know don Juan told us to try not to do that.\n\nYou see that weird yellow static the man is watching? That's one view for \"videos in the air\".\n\nBut Carlos explained several ways to view silent knowledge to us.\n\nThat one is \"the wall\", but there's also \"the whorl\".\n\nAnd embedded in the wall are flat depressions filled with \"the abstract\". Into which the whorl can become visible.  In fact, in the abstract, anything can become visible. It really is \"abstract\"!\n\nOr back in the world of meanings, your energy body can swarm off of your torso and float up to create the whorling magical object.\n\nA heads up: The instant you see a depression filled with the abstract, on \"the wall\", you'll come to realize what total nonsense other magical systems tell to their followers.  \n\nAnd be astounded that people fall for it!  While being equally puzzled over why you can't simply point out the obvious to them.\n\nThat other \"systems\" are teaching totally human feel good make believe.  \n\nBut there's nothing you can say, to free their followers from that ugly pretending.\n\nIt's not real, not true, and certainly so limiting that it's like 1st grade mathematics, compared to the kinds of math that physicists need to use.\n\nThe whorl is an intense purple puff swirling slowly amidst jet blackness, on which a tiny pomegranate dot can burst into existence along an edge, and emit text messages you can read.\n\nIt's far less confusing to read words than to have an Indian man hovering on a wooden platform over North America 160 million years ago, explaining where you ended up.\n\nAnd I have a theory that text keeps us alert and awake, because we're \"readers\". Perhaps another reason don Juan suggested that method of viewing silent knowledge.\n\nWe're used to sitting still while reading, without falling asleep.\n\nWhereas while watching videos, we commonly fall asleep.\n\nSo that \"traveling\" to videos in the air often causes a nearly instant feeling of intense tiredness, and an overwhelming urge to lay down and stop practicing for the night.\n\nIf you aren't careful you'll find your hand reaching for the remote, to turn off the magic so that you can go to bed.\n\nWe're creatures of habit.\n\nStill...\n\nHow cool is it to be able to do this sort of magic, after 58 years of nothing but pretending in our community?\n\nAttackers all around, trashing Carlos as a fake. He was even censored on the web, in places like wikipedia.\n\nEvery attempt was made to remove his influence forever.\n\nBut it didn't work!!! The truth is on our side, and we have techy people as good as the next guy.\n\nThus it now turns out, Carlos had the ONLY real magic on earth. And it was EVERYTHING ELSE that was made up in order to steal money.\n\nQuite a reversal of fates.\n\nI sure hope none of my social media readers are involved in stealing money from others, by teaching them pretend magic.\n\nBut if they are, why not try the real thing until you get it to work, and then \"modify\" the fake magic you were selling?\n\nJust about every fake magical system could in fact be \"fixed\".\n\nI hope to see kungfu people actually leaping across treetops before I die.

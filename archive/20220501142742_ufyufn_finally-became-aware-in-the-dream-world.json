Closer to the truth, when you're doing 4 gates dreaming, is that your obsession freed energy from other things.  And the extra energy focused on your desire to become lucid, activating intent.\n\nTo wake you up.\n\nBut really, you were blocking the process all along with your \"dirty link\" to intent.  All the internal dialogue and misdirected attention, focused on past memories and fussiness.\n\nBy concentrating on that \"good\" goal you freed a little energy, and your link to intent became cleaner.  So intent woke you up.  \n\nIntent, not you.\n\nSeems like a small point, but it's not.\n\nAn analogy:  As a little kid you believe Santa is going to bring you an expensive toy train.\n\nNaturally, it's your dad who has to bring it.\n\nBut you set up a little \"Santos\" altar, using day of the dead candles your mexican grandma had in the basement, and then you write a very nice letter to Santa, complementing his wardrobe choices and promising the best cookies in town.\n\nYour dad finds it all amusing, so even though the train you wanted is expensive he pretty much has no choice because of all of your efforts.\n\nThen after Christmas you go back to school, and start charging people to teach them how to manipulate Santa Claus.  You even hold workshops and wear a cool, \"Santana Bandana\".\n\n\\&gt;For next time, how can i realize that I'm not \"in the real world\" even though i knew i was dreaming?\n\nBest theory I have right now is that \"sobriety\", what you are seeking here, and which gives you the \"purpose\" you need to pass all 4 gates, is actually part of the awareness of the tonal.\n\nThe awareness of our tonal body is stuck in the \"energy pouches\".\n\nWe scoop up pieces of our double, visible as purple puffs, and place them on the pouches. They stick there, because they are more powerful when they get close to other blobs of awareness.\n\nThe puff stuffed on the liver energy pouch for example, starts having conversations with the tonal energy down inside it. They become \"closer\" to a single blob of energy.\n\nThen if your energy body forms well enough for you to \"switch over to it\", for example you walk through a portal on  your solid wall and enter another world, you now have a case of the awareness of the Tonal being willing to join a little with the double's awareness, to give the double sobriety.\n\nIf the tonal is yellow energy, and the energy body is blue, the energy body is most of what goes into dream worlds, but perhaps he has a yellow \"puff\" stuck on his eyes.\n\nSound crazy?  No!  In fact, you can do the reverse.\n\nThis is WAY out there in Silent Knowledge territory, but you stuff the puffs until you see them stuck to your torso.\n\nThey tend to lose the purple color when they are sitting on top of the pouches.\n\nSometimes turning yellowish.  But we don't have enough people at that level to be sure about the color change.\n\nSo you stuff your puffs, build a visible energy body, and at some point the room goes whitish.\n\nNo more amazing puff world of swirling lights.  Now you have whitish light on surfaces, which is capable of forming translocation scenes and phantom rooms.\n\nYour tonal awareness is somewhat merged with the energy body, giving your tonal a lot more power, and your energy body (proto-double) a lot more sobriety.\n\nBut you want to stare 2000 miles at a specific distant sight. And you don't have enough energy to travel there. What can you do?\n\n\"Puff Goggles\"! Fancy used to call it an \"Energy Telescope\". You scoop up puffs, form a big ball, hold it on the sides, and look through it.\n\nYou're looking through a piece of your double!  So you get to borrow his amazing magical sight.\n\nIn this new case of puff goggles, the puffs are gone before you start!  You're in the whitish light.\n\nSo just \"scoop\" some of your energy body off your torso. Pretend it's a basin of water somehow balanced on  your stomach and chest, and just use your hands to scoop some up, and pour it over your eyes.\n\nYou'll end up with a visible purple puff stuck to your eyes.  Anywhere you look will be tainted by intense purple, and the crystalline nature of the puffs will now be part of your vision.\n\nLooking 2000 miles away is easy now. It's not easy to tell what the hell you are seeing.  But it's easy to see it.\n\nSo my theory is, the same way you can put some of the double's awareness on your eyes, to gain his vision, you can put some of the Tonals awareness on the double, so he has sobriety in dreaming.\n\n\"Sobriety\" is the \"superpower\" of the Tonal.\n\n\\&gt;How can i go to other worlds? (because my portal didnt work)\n\nYou're infected with the book deal mind. Sounds like damage from hanging out in astral travel subreddits.  That's a false narrative which teaches attention seeking and pretending, and typically anyone too infected with \"astral travel' is like someone who took too many drugs. They never learn.\n\nSo fight it off.\n\nIt will greatly harm your progress. You need to study more to realize what that statement means, and to get over that obsession.\n\nIt's sort of like you've become interested in doing what you do, to impress others. Not for the sake of learning and exploring.\n\nSo your \"intent\" is extra dirty. It's not even the intent to do what you think you want to do. It's the intent of the river of shit, which is to gain advantage with other people.\n\nSorcery is so very difficult, that's a very bad burden to carry around.\n\nI guess a good analogy would be if you learned to shapeshift.  Not hard to do! And you could alter your form, and go outside into the real world to use it.\n\nWhere you'll find, it works!\n\nJust as Carlos wrote, you are in a new \"shape\", and can interact with the world based on that.\n\nBut there's no one around.  The world is empty. So you become obsessed with \"proving\" it wasn't just a dream. You don't accept that you were fully awake, could have turned on the bedroom light at any moment, and you even drank from the water bottle you had on a table in the darkness. Everything indicates you are the \"real you\".  Not a dream.\n\nYou even bang your toe on the foot of the bed, and it hurts. You shapeshift, and then go outside. In every possible way it's just you, opening the door, and going outside for real.\n\nAnd when you come back, it's just you coming back.  You even switch on the lights once you get back in the room, and everything is normal.\n\nBut despite your own experiences you become obsessed with proving you really did that, in the eyes of other people.\n\nYou're doomed to lose that ability. Because that ability to shapeshift and then have the sobriety to go out into the real world, to \"take it for a test drive\", was a deal you struck with intent.\n\nYou worked hard and cleaned some very tiny piece of your link to intent, which you used to shapeshift and go outside.\n\nNow you're BLASTING it with a completely different desire.  An entirely different *intent*.\n\nThe *intent* of impressing other people. It's not even a moral issue.  It's not a \"shame on you for thinking impure thoughts of personal gain\".\n\nWitchcraft TV shows like that one.  \"You can't use magic for personal gain\".\n\nBut that's wrong. Sure you can! Ask any talented real witch like Cholita.  She's 90% personal gain oriented.\n\nThe problem is, what particular gain are  you adding on, besides just wanting to learn?\n\nAnd can you \"drop that\" from your mind while you are trying to summon intent, to allow you to do that magic?\n\nNope. No one but a real sorcerer has that clean of a link to intent. And it's in the books.  Don Juan warns that the \"seeing\" of even a sorcerer, can fail when they try to see something too close to their own interests.\n\nNo one's intent link is perfectly clean.  Such a person would be quite a scary prospect.", "edited": 1651415608.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i6wnr30", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t sound like 4 gates dreaming to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are very hard to sustain, even for more than 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other kind of lucid dream sorcerers have is when you go into dreaming from silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan said &amp;quot;those are always real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As opposed to the phantom dream realms our double usually wanders around in, which often contain just a single &amp;quot;scout&amp;quot; (inorganic being).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you have &amp;quot;the good kind&amp;quot; of dreaming there, assuming you went in using silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The normal kind of 4 gates dream, where you simply realize you are in a dream, stop, fight off the desire to continue the dream, and then look at your hands, is cause by &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos wrote about it, maybe to settle the mystery once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The community as a whole got the impression it was their &amp;quot;coolness&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;intense efforts&amp;quot; which caused  them to wake up in the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fell for that too, since I went to bed an extra 4 hours early when I was focusing on 4 gates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought it was &amp;quot;obsession&amp;quot; that could get you in, but in fact, it&amp;#39;s intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent itself noticed my desire to get in, so it would give me a little &amp;quot;nudge&amp;quot; once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did don Juan call it, &amp;quot;the impetus&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when intent is summoned by hard efforts, it&amp;#39;s easy to think the hard efforts were the cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a mistaken point of view.

And you don&amp;#39;t have enough energy to travel there. What can you do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Puff Goggles&amp;quot;! Fancy used to call it an &amp;quot;Energy Telescope&amp;quot;. You scoop up puffs, form a big ball, hold it on the sides, and look through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re looking through a piece of your double!  So you get to borrow his amazing magical sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this new case of puff goggles, the puffs are gone before you start!  You&amp;#39;re in the whitish light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just &amp;quot;scoop&amp;quot; some of your energy body off your torso. Pretend it&amp;#39;s a basin of water somehow balanced on  your stomach and chest, and just use your hands to scoop some up, and pour it over your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll end up with a visible purple puff stuck to your eyes.  Anywhere you look will be tainted by intense purple, and the crystalline nature of the puffs will now be part of your vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking 2000 miles away is easy now. It&amp;#39;s not easy to tell what the hell you are seeing.  But it&amp;#39;s easy to see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my theory is, the same way you can put some of the double&amp;#39;s awareness on your eyes, to gain his vision, you can put some of the Tonals awareness on the double, so he has sobriety in dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sobriety&amp;quot; is the &amp;quot;superpower&amp;quot; of the Tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;How can i go to other worlds? (because my portal didnt work)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re infected with the book deal mind. Sounds like damage from hanging out in astral travel subreddits.  That&amp;#39;s a false narrative which teaches attention seeking and pretending, and typically anyone too infected with &amp;quot;astral travel&amp;#39; is like someone who took too many drugs. They never learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So fight it off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will greatly harm your progress. You need to study more to realize what that statement means, and to get over that obsession.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s sort of like you&amp;#39;ve become interested in doing what you do, to impress others. Not for the sake of learning and exploring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So your &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; is extra dirty. It&amp;#39;s not even the intent to do what you think you want to do. It&amp;#39;s the intent of the river of shit, which is to gain advantage with other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is so very difficult, that&amp;#39;s a very bad burden to carry around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess a good analogy would be if you learned to shapeshift.  Not hard to do! And you could alter your form, and go outside into the real world to use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you&amp;#39;ll find, it works!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as Carlos wrote, you are in a new &amp;quot;shape&amp;quot;, and can interact with the world based on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s no one around.  The world is empty. So you become obsessed with &amp;quot;proving&amp;quot; it wasn&amp;#39;t just a dream. You don&amp;#39;t accept that you were fully awake, could have turned on the bedroom light at any moment, and you even drank from the water bottle you had on a table in the darkness. Everything indicates you are the &amp;quot;real you&amp;quot;.  Not a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You even bang your toe on the foot of the bed, and it hurts. You shapeshift, and then go outside. In every possible way it&amp;#39;s just you, opening the door, and going outside for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you come back, it&amp;#39;s just you coming back.  You even switch on the lights once you get back in the room, and everything is normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But despite your own experiences you become obsessed with proving you really did that, in the eyes of other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re doomed to lose that ability. Because that ability to shapeshift and then have the sobriety to go out into the real world, to &amp;quot;take it for a test drive&amp;quot;, was a deal you struck with intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You worked hard and cleaned some very tiny piece of your link to intent, which you used to shapeshift and go outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you&amp;#39;re BLASTING it with a completely different desire.  An entirely different &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of impressing other people. It&amp;#39;s not even a moral issue.  It&amp;#39;s not a &amp;quot;shame on you for thinking impure thoughts of personal gain&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Witchcraft TV shows like that one.  &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t use magic for personal gain&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s wrong. Sure you can! Ask any talented real witch like Cholita.  She&amp;#39;s 90% personal gain oriented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, what particular gain are  you adding on, besides just wanting to learn?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And can you &amp;quot;drop that&amp;quot; from your mind while you are trying to summon intent, to allow you to do that magic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope. No one but a real sorcerer has that clean of a link to intent. And it&amp;#39;s in the books.  Don Juan warns that the &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; of even a sorcerer, can fail when they try to see something too close to their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one&amp;#39;s intent link is perfectly clean.  Such a person would be quite a scary prospect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ufyufn/finally_became_aware_in_the_dream_world/i6wnr30/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1651414357.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ufyufn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i6xioct", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Yonak237", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i6xi2b9", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_c1n0utdz", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Ok.

Your 'voice' if you will, but obviously you're not really talking, you're thinking/intending.  It's so easy to get caught up in the content of your dream.  Forget that.  Focus on your practice.  Remember, dreaming is the river that flows into the ocean.  It's just the beginning.  From dreaming try intending your way to your energy body, or even back to a phantom copy of the room you fell asleep in.  From there, you can try to intend the energy body, which will feel like you are rolling up tight like a cigar, and rolling right out of your physical body.\n\nYou can also intend shape-shifting, my favorite.\n\nYou can also try to find a scout and follow it.  Don't be scared.  You'll know the scouts when you see them.   In this case, it wouldn't hurt to have a question to ask, or something you wish to learn, a topic you would like more info on.  I don't usually do that, I just like to fly with them to new worlds.  But I did learn from an Owl (IOB) in dreaming how to perfect flying, that was useful.  So if you're the knowledge seeking type, it helps to have something 'cued up' so you don't start mind-racing in dreaming.  Mind-racing (internal dialogue) kills dreaming.  \n\nI would recommend all of these as options for your next successful dreaming.  Again, in list form:\n\n1) Twin positions\n\n2) Reaching the energy body/phantom copy of your room\n\n3) Following a Scout\n\n4) Shapeshifting\n\nAnd again, ignore the contents of your dream.  You want to focus on the practice.  Adopt the mood of a dreamer: light, sober, but playful, almost with a feeling of awe and excitement.  That is the best mood for dreaming (in my experience)  Fear and over-analytical mind will kill the dream session.  \n\nIt's very exciting you had that success.  Don't stop now, and don't spend too much time in here talking about, or get hung up on your 'achievement'.  You'll likely find the more you talk about it, the more it dissipates.  I don't like to visit this sub more than once a week if that because of the possibility of getting sucked in.  You can see people start posting more and more, longer and longer, until they seem to perfect the \"Art of \\[talking about\\] Dreaming lol.  Moreso than doing dreaming.  It's a slippery slope.  Practice, practice, practice.  And don't let it ruin your day if you fail one night, many nights, etc.  Obsessing over not being able to repeat your experience becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Use the daytime to dust your link with intent and keep it as sparkly clean as possible, make sure baggage isn't weighing you down or you won't be able to soar, literally.

Again, in list form:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Twin positions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Reaching the energy body/phantom copy of your room&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Following a Scout&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Shapeshifting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And again, ignore the contents of your dream.  You want to focus on the practice.  Adopt the mood of a dreamer: light, sober, but playful, almost with a feeling of awe and excitement.  That is the best mood for dreaming (in my experience)  Fear and over-analytical mind will kill the dream session.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very exciting you had that success.  Don&amp;#39;t stop now, and don&amp;#39;t spend too much time in here talking about, or get hung up on your &amp;#39;achievement&amp;#39;.  You&amp;#39;ll likely find the more you talk about it, the more it dissipates.  I don&amp;#39;t like to visit this sub more than once a week if that because of the possibility of getting sucked in.  You can see people start posting more and more, longer and longer, until they seem to perfect the &amp;quot;Art of [talking about] Dreaming lol.  Moreso than doing dreaming.  It&amp;#39;s a slippery slope.  Practice, practice, practice.  And don&amp;#39;t let it ruin your day if you fail one night, many nights, etc.  Obsessing over not being able to repeat your experience becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Use the daytime to dust your link with intent and keep it as sparkly clean as possible, make sure baggage isn&amp;#39;t weighing you down or you won&amp;#39;t be able to soar, literally.  Anyway good luck you are on the right path, and it&amp;#39;s exciting to hear about somebody having this kind of break through.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null,

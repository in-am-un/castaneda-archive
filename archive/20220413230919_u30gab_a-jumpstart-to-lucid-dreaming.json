I could re-enter any dream that ended, over and over again.\n\nBut when the book first came out, I was lucky to get 30 seconds every 2 weeks.\n\nI thought it was all about obsession, but I was wrong.\n\nThe lucid dreaming people were saying a while back, the only reliable method that works for most people is to ask yourself during the day, \"Am I dreaming?\", and test it.  Pinch yourself, jump up and see how hard you fall.\n\nIn other words, obsess over it.\n\nBut then Carlos explained it.\n\nHe said, \"intent\" is what wakes you up.\n\nNot you.\n\nIt's why you can tell someone about lucid dreaming, and then that very night they find their hands.\n\nBut not again after that.\n\n*Intent* gave them the knock of the spirit, in response to you telling them about it.\n\nOr, you're own *intent* caused it.\n\nBut it was still *intent* that did it.\n\nThe problem is, how do  you get *intent* to do that for you?\n\nSo we're back to the same problem.\n\nYou *intend*, by intending to intend.\n\nUseless.\n\nBut there is a \"flow\" to intent.\n\nThat's why once you \"break the barrier\", you can get lucid every single night.  As long as you don't skip a night by indulging in the day and becoming too tired.\n\nI just don't know anyone else who worked hard enough to have that many 4 gates lucid dreams.\n\nMy method was forcing myself silent to go directly into dreaming from awake.\n\nI allowed 4 extra sleeping hours to do that, and didn't stop forcing silence until I fell asleep.\n\nFor men, it's important to find your hands every single time.  And look from object to object.\n\nEven if you have great success like you did, it doesn't count unless you had enough sobriety (purpose?) to look at your hands, and then from object to object.

He got his own local TV station, channel 18, and was fund raising in the LA area.\n\nWith bizarre lectures on \"smirtis\", and \"rakshasas\", and all the sorts of Yogi fairy tales, that make people feel like they're learning something.\n\nWhen it's just his fantasies, colored by writings of past people's fantasies.\n\nNone of it based on any actual experience someone had enough times to take seriously.\n\nBut he'd bop his flower around, and you'd worry he might start pulling petals off his daisy if he kept up like that.  And sitting on his little throne, with his big Yogi beard and attention seeking garb, it was kind of hypnotic.\n\nIt gave you \"hope\".\n\nNaturally his movement went bust because it was all pretending mixed with some meager green line effects.  And his TV station was replaced with a very good bible study teacher, who also gave watchers a feeling of \"hope\".\n\nIt was the first strong signal channel if you were up late at night, and went off the channel 2 to 13 of local TV.  Obviously for people looking for \"hope\" in the darkness.\n\nMakes no sense now, but did back then.\n\nSo we're programmed to ignore obvious odd things, when listening to a guru toss a daisy around while he's giving you a lecture on what seems like magical topics.\n\nThe problem is, sorcery is real.\n\nThere's no \"smirtis\" or \"rakshasas\" you can't see for yourself.\n\nAnd it's important to realize that when you listen, so you can extricate yourself from \"pretend land\".  From pretending your magic, to sooth yourself.\n\nI truly believe animations can fix this.\n\nTalking is too tied to our crummy internal dialogue.  So essentially, as we listen to the Daisy bopping guru (Muktananda has an ostrich feather he bopped, just a few miles from Dance Home), we're \"bathing in hope\".\n\nFeeling sorry for ourselves.\n\nIt's a big mistake.  When that happens, one ought to seriously consider going somewhere else.\n\nInstead, you should be hearing \"tips\".  And have dozens in your memory that you got from lectures past, which produced astounding results.\n\nBut that only happens when you can move your assemblage point each day, and \"try out\" something you heard in a lecture.\n\nIt has to 'get real' before stuff makes sense.\n\nCarlos and the witches spoke of our beam of awareness focusing between our toes all the time, on \"me, me, me\".\n\nIt turns out, that's LITERALLY true.\n\nSorcerers can see where their beam of awareness is focused.\n\nVisibly.\n\nNow I have to put some \"caveats\" in with that, because I'm not animating it.  So anyone reading will visualize whatever they do, probably for attention seeking purposes.  They'll twist it, to sooth themselves.\n\nAnd the value is lost.   That's the problem with text.\n\nPictures are better, but animations will kick butt big time.\n\nHere's how you can find that beam and see it for yourself.\n\nIt' snothing less than summoning silent knowledge on any \"topic\" you like, using the eyes.\n\nWe do that all the time in darkroom!  That's the odd thing about it.\n\nBut at that point you're still just overjoyed to actually see a puff.\n\nYou have \"puff blindness\".    I suppose a little like eating at Hooter's, and you don't realize they have your favorite item on the menu, because you're hypnotized by the big hooters on your waitress.\n\nWe see the \"big ample puff\", and we're out to lunch.\n\nNot paying attention to the menu, so we end up with mediocre choices.\n\nI can't correct there here with words, it'll take animations.\n\nBut just so I don't lose all this:\n\nThe beam of awareness becomes fully visible, in perfect silence.\n\nIf you gaze into the darkness, it \"smashes\" an area around 2 feet in diameter.\n\nThat area reveals whatever you are wanting to know, or expecting to see.\n\nBut at first you don't get a choice.  You kind of have 'sledge hammer\" vision, minus the violence.\n\nYou can smash a hole in realize there, and see dream objects or scenes right there.\n\nI suppose the witches and Carlos must have analyzed where that beam goes when they were feeling sorry for themselves.  And saw it was focused between the toes.  It had \"sledge hammered\" a hole down there, and on the other side they saw \"poor me, poor baby me\".\n\nBut it's not figurative!  It's literal.\n\nBut it's \"glued\" to the rest of reality, via a tinge of the abstract.\n\nAnd the abstract doesn't yield to words.\n\nJust now, when you finally reach perfect silence, the \"beam of awareness\" radiated out by the assemblage point, becomes visible in it's effect.\n\nIn it's ability to \"smash\" the darkness where it focuses, flatten it into a yellowish \"screen\", and videos materialize there.\n\nOr, touch, heat, smell.  Frankly, Tensegrity at very advanced levels, can \"switch senses\" being used to sense the results of the assemblage point movement.\n\nIf I were to animate it, I'd shrink the 3D character down, the virtual chacmool the animations will have, and position her in a series of movements, as if the movements formed a pattern on the floor, that was well spread out.\n\nThey kind of do, but for practicality, they don't really lave the spot you started.\n\nAfter all, people had to do those at workshops.\n\nmartial arts are designed that way.  The kata returns to the same spot at the end.\n\nBut imagine you spread it out, to show the animations of what is going on.\n\nEach long form likely has 4 dream portals available.\n\nSpread out as a little copy of our chacmool, so they can all animate in place in a pattern, where you can look down on it, maybe a bit like one of those games where you watch little people building cities, at 4 places in the spread out, there's a magic portal.  A doorway.\n\nIf the little character leans into that a bit, the upper half of their body emerges into a full on dream.\n\nYou are surrounded by actual fully real dreams, at turning points in the form.\n\nBut only because the beam of awareness can do that.\n\nOur beam is perhaps, the Eagle's Command to find a world to live in.\n\nTo \"get stuck\" so we can explore in detail for him, and give back memories of how it \"feels\" there.\n\nBut we don't have to get stuck.\n\nIt's the storytelling that gets you stuck.  The internal dialogue.\n\nYou can use this fact during darkroom to create amazing phantom worlds.\n\nJust \"narrate\" it.  you get control over your \"beam\" of awareness, and while doing the form, you can simply state what the beam will \"smash open\" when it reaches a movement in the form that is a bit of a \"climax\".\n\nIt has to have a tiny bit of finality feeling to it, and then that's a good place to open a dreaming portal.\n\nBut you'll have to visually see it.\n\nThe beam of awareness uses our \"hooks\" to the emanations.\n\nHow we \"grab on to meaning\".\n\nWe have more than 1!\n\nSight, hearing, smell, touch, heat/cold.\n\nAnd we have \"abstract senses\" too. I have no idea how many.\n\nEach a \"hook\" to extract the feelings transmitted when the beam of awareness, flows into the emanations.\n\nSo at SUPER advanced levels of tensegrity, you could do your long form for \"sight\".\n\nAnd it would be absolutely amazing.\n\nThen for smell. Then sound, then even taste.\n\nThis is a comment, and they allow more if you go back and edit.\n\nWhich I just did, and saw I was very close to the limit.  Didn't take all this, until I replaced it with \"xxx\" along, then edited that to put all this. \n\nBut I'd best stop.

You can never lose.   And all you do is make a certain pattern, after recognizing the current rotation.\n\nBut 20 years later you forget and then the game has some \"tension\" again.\n\nWe need the \"tension\" of ping pong  to animate it.  \n\nIn darkroom, when \"the thrill is gone\" the attention no longer focuses as needed, for dramatic sideways shifts.  You go from reading \"Mad magazine\" and loving it, to reading Shakespeare and thinking snobby thoughts.\n\nBoring!\n\nAnd we NEED to animate \"darkroom games\".

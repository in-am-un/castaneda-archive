I've been here for a long time, but I've never written on Reddit. Now I got a bit of time to do it.\n\nDo you remember this practice in passing mentioned by Taisha Abelar? I have been in this practice for over ten years and now sharing my results.\n\nSince the practice had neither a name nor an explanation of what it does, I gave it a name after studying it in-depth.\n\n# The practice of energy stabilization\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Purpose:** to stabilize parasitic energy fluctuations in the energy cocoon.\n\n**Duration:** 7\u201315 minutes, 2\u20133 times a day.\n\n**Difficulty:** low.\n\n**Required knowledge, skills, resources:** basic understanding about exists an energy body.\n\n**Positive result:** rolls over pacification; warmth and calmness, created by the stabilization of energies; makes it easier to stop thoughts.\n\n**Disadvantages and undesirable effects:** practically absent; if this practice is intensively performed and no more for more than one year, then increased drowsiness and lethargy are possible.\n\n**Value:** allows beginners to understand how strongly the state of energy influences certain practices and the general condition of the body and mind. After accumulating stabilization experience of the energy body, practice can significantly improve the ability to notice and distinguish between energies and the channels through which they flow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most effective way to stabilize energy is, at the same time, the simplest. Unfortunately, this practice is a little uncomfortable for overweight and even overweight people. The author had a chance to check this sad fact on himself and had to lose weight. Without mastering and applying this practice, it isn't easy to develop and move on your path. According to the author, this is one of the most important practices in a cultivator's life, gradually revealing access to incredible depths of relaxation and tranquility. Now you can come to the perception of the energy body, and from that practice begins the actual work with energies.\n\nSit on hunker down near a massive stone or concrete wall (with gypsum board or wooden, the result will worsen). Lean your back on it. Place your forehead on your knees and wrap your arms around your legs, pulling them closer to you. Keep your heels on the floor with your feet together. You seem to shrink, becoming even more compact and smaller. Only part of the back touches the wall in this position, approximately in the area of \u200b\u200bthe kidneys. Sit down so that your feet do not slide on the floor. Some sit in socks on a smooth floor or carpet and then resent it because they slide and drive away from the wall, bang their heads, and not keep their body balance and falling. Try to refrain from doing this. It would not have to be mentioned if this had not happened to practitioners infamously often.\n\nImagine that there is a large ball around you, filled with light \u2013 your energy body, the walls of which you can almost reach with your fingertips. For some, it is much larger with a radius of one and a half to two meters; for others, it is smaller, select the size according to the sensations. At the very center of this sphere is your physical body. Try to feel the surface of the sphere as an extension of your physical body.\n\n[The practice of energy stabilization. Image by \u00a9 Alex Kuu.](https://preview.redd.it/a2ium1ia45n81.jpg?width=1640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0453190f1910e20b567d0854bba8150eebb1d5b1)\n\nSitting on hunker down, you squeeze and pull the shell of this cocoon-sphere towards you, as if with a multitude of energy hands pulling one part of the ball toward you, then the other, contracting more and more tightly. Also, you should not forget about the physical body. You pull your legs towards you with your hands, pressing your forehead to your knees. Thus, you simultaneously shrink and become denser and smaller in size energetically and more compact physically like a lump of paper that you squeeze more and more tightly, becoming smaller and harder.\n\nSit in this position for a few minutes. At some point, it will seem to you that you are shaking. It is a manifestation of energy instability. Continue to squeeze yourself and hold in this position. Muscles can also begin to shake or contract convulsively. Repeat the contraction of the energy body several times; each time, the physical body will shake. After a while, vibration, shaking, and trembling will disappear. Repeated squeezing will not cause vibration again. A pleasant warmth and calmness will rush over you. The less distracted you are, the faster you stabilize. For improved concentration, it is preferable to be in a state of inner silence during the practice.\n\nBy practicing energy stabilization for several months, two to three times a day, you will understand that the technique allows you to calm down and put yourself in order as quickly as possible after any scandal or other event that destabilized you.\n\nThose who are especially diligent in the practice of energy stabilization will discover a vast world of internal energies \u2013 they will have a moment of clarity and see how people are arranged from the inside. This effect is achieved by regularly focusing attention on your cocoon \u2013 the energy body. You will clearly understand how it arranged your energy body-cocoon, which is larger than the physical body and almost repeats the shape of your imaginary ball. The longer you look at the same object, the more you can say about it and the more details you notice on it. It is the same with the energy body. Watching your cocoon, detecting instabilities, and trying to neutralize them, you will gradually discover the world of your energies, strikingly different from everything that you imagined and what you read in books. Of course, you will find parallels with various books on working with the body's energies, but you will understand, it is impossible to describe in detail in words or draw; it must be cognized and experienced personally.\n\nIf we consider what the practice of stopping thoughts is focused on, from an energetic point of view, it can be summarized as follows: all it tries to do is normalize and stabilize the flow of energies inside the cocoon. The energy stabilization practice helps this process a lot. In fact, the practice of stopping thoughts can be called one of the initial practices of relaxation and tranquility. Without a steady flow of energy, you cannot progress in relaxation practices. Your energy, like a small mountain river knee-deep, merrily bubbling on the stones along the slope, should turn into a calm deep, mighty river, confidently flowing forward.\n\nThese practices will be enough for you to facilitate significantly stopping thoughts with any of the methods.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The practice of energy stabilization makes it easier to stop thoughts.", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 124, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"a2ium1ia45n81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 95, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2ium1ia45n81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad05c658f5e25cd3d9b76b57f164327d4e89ab05"}, {"y": 191, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2ium1ia45n81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30c95cef6a0c3a71d0970bff4240dde49c0bc00f"}, {"y": 283, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2ium1ia45n81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95b02fde9004ef0bfcd28ac72c9faf5c0457dc89"}, {"y": 567, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2ium1ia45n81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=425f648f36183ac7455738b3765fdfdaf48e4268"}, {"y": 850, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2ium1ia45n81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0d0e640e6be431e25405fac9d3f2e8bdf658449"}, {"y": 956, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2ium1ia45n81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=229b26451db9ff62eb0bf2e24cc0e5ed6f8aed07"}], "s": {"y": 1453, "x": 1640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a2ium1ia45n81.jpg?width=1640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0453190f1910e20b567d0854bba8150eebb1d5b1"}, "id": "a2ium1ia45n81"}}, "name": "t3_td34s6", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_dv9h3a7s", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xgS5JT5-Ab3mmegDgtJsWyWP9VUpOpuj7C_4pdX_cSU.jpg", "edited": 1647172613.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1647162926.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;#39;m from Ukraine.

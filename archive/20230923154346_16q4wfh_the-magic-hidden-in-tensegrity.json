Just reach way back up high behind you to the side, bend your head down the opposite direction and stretch the opposite arm to the floor.\n\nSo that you have a big stretch all along your back, and the hand is reaching up higher than you normally do.\n\nNow make sure you're next to something to steady yourself on, and take a deep breath.\n\nHold it in while you gently compress the air in your chest and gaze up there with your head turned looking up, in a rather odd but not uncomfortable position.\n\nYou're like a cat, stretching after a long nap.  Combined with a deep yawn.\n\nCats yawn too!\n\nThis will \"uncrust\" energy from your backside where it has been stuck to the inside of your luminous shell for nearly your whole life.\n\nTrying to escape \"you\" in the middle.  Because your physical body awareness (the tonal) wreaks of self-pity and remorse.\n\nIf you do it just right and are silent you'll \"see stars\" up there. It's because the crusted energy is loosened and runs up your arm to the top directed by your gaze, to condense whatever shiny outer coating you have.\n\nEven if it's only up to your ankles, you'll get an amazing fireworks show.  A steady one too!\n\nI posted a technique on how to make it rain in your darkroom, by this method. Perhaps 3 years ago.\n\nJust let that patch of \"stars\" run down to the floor and light up the pool of your own shiny coating which is still mostly down there. Then bend down and stir it with your fingers and palms.\n\nYou'll form a \"Silent Knowledge Entity\" if done right.\n\nOr your Ally will form it for you.\n\nDon't worry about the deep breathing being \"cheating\"!\n\nWe dismiss all sorts of magical effects, claiming it's just a malfunction of our physical body.\n\nYou only have to breathe in deeply at first.\n\nLater you'll only have to gently point your arm in that direction and a patch of dazzling shiny yellow sparkles will form.\n\nIt's silent knowledge!\n\nThese aren't like the puffs, where if you try to look at them too long they go away.\n\nThat's a green zone problem.  On the J curve map in this subreddit.\n\nAnd of course it comes to an end in the red zone.  You can not only gaze in a sustained fashion at the purple puffs, but even grab them and form them into shapes.\n\nThat's what \"Affection for the Energy Body\" does.\n\nBut as I'm fond of pointing out  you can even manufacture a freeway overpass towering above your practice room, or a small \"clown car\" on the floor.\n\nAnd then shrink down and ride away in it.\n\nMinus the scary clowns if you're lucky.\n\nOr perhaps safer would be to form your freeway overpass in your darkroom, and stage truck accidents on the northbound T\u014dhoku Expressway in Tokyo.\n\nNo scary clowns involved in that one.  You just need your Ally to learn to drive a japanese delivery truck.\n\nI never realized it before this, but my own use of the puffs for \"practical magic\" (horizontal assemblage point shifts) isn't really all that different than the tensegrity forms Carlos made for us.\n\nIt's all \"ludicrous\"!\n\nMine just aren't \"dignified\".\n\nBut the entire Castaneda fan base nearly drowned in dignity, so the value of having a little crazy fun during practice seems worth the price of lost dignity.\n\nBuried in this Affection pass which does indeed form your double into something real, right there with you, is a very strange movement.\n\nI don't remember anyone giving details on why you do that.\n\nThe hand rotation on the right side.\n\nFor a while I thought you were \"forming\" the rotational movement of the shoulders of your double.  Just as you rotate your hands down at the knees, to form those.\n\nThe shoulder's \"clavicle\" can in fact move like that, whereas other joints aren't nearly as fluid.\n\nAnd that may be why the odd hand rotation is there, but it's also inevitable that it will do what is shown here in this picture.\n\nCause a \"Silent Knowledge Flurry\" of sparkling lights.\n\nThat stuff is stable and can be used for even better magic than making clown cars from purple puffs.\n\nOf course, for beginners the hard part is giving up their hidden goal of attention and money seeking from other humans, to instead prioritize \"knowing\" sorcery.\n\nWanting to know for real. Not just wanting to know, for social status.\n\nUntil you do you'll just be looking for excuses to cut corners and con others into thinking you are succeeding.\n\n\"Knowing\" takes real work and sustained (daily) action towards what you want to \"know\".\n\nAnd don't forget that the tensegrity forms are \"containers\" for intent.\n\nWhen they fill to the top, the show is on!\n\nBut they fill with silence and the alternate views of reality that allows.\n\nNot with visualizing and pretending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Magic Hidden In Tensegrity", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"qpgru5jbk1qb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qpgru5jbk1qb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c0dcdc9e8ddf25f2dbf28ec3ac6d45e2117d6f9"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qpgru5jbk1qb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63e91dfca953c0038975f99c6f07bedcf741fa4b"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qpgru5jbk1qb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95cdafb14022d7c603d14241ce2cf3f4bcd8881d"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qpgru5jbk1qb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d51988a2920635701dec9417e4fd1eb2be4cd931"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qpgru5jbk1qb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab1298c35324e4a577aed17b5d58691e1144829c"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qpgru5jbk1qb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46f38a995b5e773d4cacc0dd8bf3a741615aa1c4"}], "s": {"y": 3072, "x": 3072, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qpgru5jbk1qb1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01baacc2fdf8976b5f47bace94c59a1cde840880"}, "id": "qpgru5jbk1qb1"}}, "name": "t3_16q4wfh", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/nBMbsMma56DzQ06cqdglFdR8FZKpPM7KswjIYuBbxmM.jpg", "edited": 1695490701.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1695476626.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qpgru5jbk1qb1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=01baacc2fdf8976b5f47bace94c59a1cde840880\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/qpgru5jbk1qb1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=01baacc2fdf8976b5f47bace94c59a1cde840880&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel silly for not noticing this sooner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When your energy rises up to perhaps your knees (though that still might be too low to make this easy), the shiny outer coating can break off into patches and move where you need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pandiculating&amp;quot; is likely the first time you&amp;#39;ll see it happen.

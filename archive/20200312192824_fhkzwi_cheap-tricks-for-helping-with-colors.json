If you want to try this, use a Tensegrity move which does it.\n\nIn private classes, Carlos demonstrated the part of long series unbending intent, where you look around up in the air, see something, *recognize* it as something you want, then jump up and pull it down.\n\n*Recognizing* beckons intent.  If a puff of purple color goes by and you notice it's not completely smooth, you're now beckoning intent.\n\nAnd if you have the idea that a hypnogogic image might be on one of the puffs, the next one will have more details.\n\nWhen you find a simple \"have a nice day\" type of face, you're all set.  Just 2 dots and a smile is all you need.\n\n*Recognizing* it as a potential face beckons intent.  The next one you find might well be a fully developed image of a person's head.\n\nSo when doing tensegrity which calls for scanning with the eyes, while you turn the head and body slowly and smoothly, you're geared up to *recognize* something.\n\nIf you sit up on the bed looking left and right, very slowly and smoothly, you are *recognizing* that there is purple light which is not uniform, filling the room.\n\nOr whatever color you found.\n\nWhen you recognize that there's a concentration of details at one point, you can keep watching that, and dreaming scenes will materialize.\n\nNot pointless dreaming scenes.  Trust me on that one. Some will jump out and scare the shit out of you.  So they're potentially \"real things\".\n\nWe just don't know what.  But there's more than humans and inorganic beings out there.  Just about every being is likely able to project a dream copy of itself for exploring, and possibly does that continuously, even when awake.\n\nNow here's the interesting thing. Once you get \"on  a roll\" recognizing things in the darkness,  you've caught the interest of your Nagual.\n\nI'm going out on a limb here, so if I'm wrong, let whoever figures it out explain where.\n\nIt's sort of like walking, or running, or peddling a bike.\n\nYou have to start the action, and maybe it's even painful. But once you're peddling along, it becomes automatic.\n\nI guess you could say, it's that muscle memory part of the brain.  He kicks back and says, \"Oh.  We're doing this over and over.  No problem. \"\n\nAnd he frees you up to just use his repetition and focus your attention on something more important.\n\nYou can visualize this the next time you see the original Wizard of Oz movie.\n\nMr. DoubleTake is the Wizard behind the curtain.\n\nBut what we want here, is to be the wicked witch of the west, peddling along on her bike.\n\nHer little legs are pumping hard, over and over, and her evilness is looking everywhere, for trouble to cause.\n\nThat's what we want. Get those recognizing legs pumping, then put some fierceness behind it, in your gaze. \n\nForget the moving, it's automatic. In fact, one day you'll find your head moving left and right on it's own, with you scanning for trouble using your gaze.\n\nThe same is true when you scan the darkness, using a gaze similar to recapitulating. \n\n The sweep.  Left and right, slowly.\n\nBut with the eyes open of course. We're trying to revive Carlos' reputation here.  Closed eyes is not spectacular enough.\n\nKeep that up, the slow gazing at the dreaming fog,  and force the deepest silence.  The success of this relies mostly on how deep the silence is.\n\nBefore,  I likely advised  you guys to take the next step, sitting up on pillows,  after you've been silent in darkness for 2  hours and have gotten rid of the images too.\n\nWalk around in inner silence, until you've even eliminated the jpegs.\n\nYea, there's jpegs stuck in our head.  You can actually find them that way, as dream images of a jpeg on your computer screen, but maybe rotated at some odd angle.\n\nOr not.  That's a bit concrete, but it's also a way to deal with them. Actually *see* them, instead of being stuck inside them.\n\nJust swipe them out of there.\n\nThen, having deleted all the jpegs, you locate Mr. DoubleTake (that mechanism inside you which judges things good or bad), and put him to rest.\n\nBut,  you don't have to do that, to get something super cool to happen.\n\nPutting him to rest will stop the world. \n\nBig deal.\n\nYou can turn Mr. DoubleTake into your slave!\n\nGet revenge!\n\nPut him into *recognize* mode.\n\nHe can't be a petty censorer of magic, if he doesn't recognize it when he sees it.\n\nSo just make him do it continuously.\n\nWith enough silence, the Nagual will pop out.\n\nAnd you won't even be able to describe it.\n\nBut it's **luscious**, to borrow a phrase from Cholita.\n\n**\"Luscious** men\", she loves to say on occasion,  as we drive along.  I never catch exactly who she's seen on the side of the road. But I'm sure he's just her type.\n\nI've got to get her to be thinking, **luscious** nagual instead, one of these days.\n\nFor those who can't get a dark room, don't worry about it. You just have to find your own path, but it won't be much different.\n\nWhen Carlos taught us to \"read off the wall\", he always did it in full daylight.\n\nHe could even glance down at his palm, as if he had notes written there.\n\nIn fact, for a very long time I thought he did.\n\nHe'd be talking, look at his palm, remember something, and the topic would change slightly.\n\nI once tried to figure out exactly how many notes he had written there. But I always got lost in the lecture and forgot to keep count.\n\nI'm going to have to talk Cholita into wearing that witches' hat, if she videos some tensegrity moves for me.  We have to cover up her face.  And it would be funny to see if anyone noticed the witch reference.\n\n[https://www.pinterest.com/pin/80150068348844377/](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/80150068348844377/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited three times", "edited": 1584217188.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fki9h4e", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got another, but it&amp;#39;s not actually a cheap trick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, don&amp;#39;t anyone start moving their head back and forth until you have something to actually look at.

If it is, please go form your own \"lineage\" elsewhere?\n\nIt's really obvious what's going on with that yogi guy.\n\nLast night, I tried to find my \"magic crystal ball\" again, and concluded, it was my inorganic being all along.\n\nI suppose the rotating head ought to have clued me in the night before...\n\nI'm not sure of this however.  Carlos never mentioned inorganic technology.\n\nSo don't hold me to it.\n\nBut don Juan made his Ally into a basket with teeth, to scare Pablito.\n\nAnd he had a gourd on his belt, said to contain the ally.\n\nI suspect, since they have no actual appearance here, an object is as good as a being.\n\nInorganic object?\n\nNo, that makes no sense.\n\nMaybe, \"Non-physical object\".\n\nAnd I have little doubt, you could even produce \"technology\" that way.\n\nAn assistant.\n\nMaybe even a \"magic ring\" if you had enough power.\n\nConsider that silence + anything from the second attention = movement of the assemblage point.\n\nSo an inorganic being in your hand, pretending to be whatever, is as good or better, than colors in the darkness.\n\nIt's certainly more entertaining!\n\nAutobiography of a Yogi has one or two of those \"non-physical objects\", although I suspect Yogananda did some big time exaggerating.\n\nLast night, minus my crystal ball, I decided to just use my hands.\n\nI found I could in fact scoop dreams into my hands, although they didn't behave very well.\n\nThey kept floating above it, like a virtual screen.\n\nI also managed to zoom some dreams.\n\nI just swiped them like Tony Stark does, with his virtual computer screens.\n\nI was low on energy though.  They were dim.\n\nAfter 2 hours, I was still suffering.  I was tired.\n\nIt could be that the night before used up my energy, the way La Gorda said that none of them could do dreaming anytime they wanted.\n\nNot enough energy.\n\nShe suggested using sunlight glitter through the eyelashes, to charge up again.\n\nI've seen that work stupendously, and also not work at all.\n\nBut I must admit, I have yet to do it more than a minute or two.\n\nMy problem is, I hate to be walking around outside turning my head back and forth, staring into the sun.  Not to mention, most of the day you have to bend your neck back, or lean back so far that it's painful.\n\nAnd even weirder.\n\nIt's just not something people see everyday.\n\nIt will attract attention as sure as a Yogi in diapers.\n\nIf you do it around your business, you'll get a reputation as \"the weird guy\".\n\nI supposed the ideal way is to go back to that Yogi guy's mountain top, take off the diapers, put on some pants, and sit quietly on the edge of a valley, facing the sun.\n\nThen get the glitter that way.\n\nBut who's got a mountain with a valley anytime they want it?\n\nAnswer:   Cell phone.\n\nAngle it down until it catches the sun.\n\nClose your eyes to mere slits, and shine that bright spot into your retina.\n\nBut make sure you have the eyelashes blocking most of it.\n\nI suspect you'll get a big time microscopic view of junk on your eyes, as well as the glitter.\n\nYou could even use it for gazing!   Microscope gazing?\n\nAnd make sure to move it back and forth, in case it tends to burn a spot because you didn't have enough eyelashes. Plus, you need to do that in order to get the \"charge\" effect.\n\nThere's some science behind that, but I can't recall the details.\n\nSome chemical is manufactured in the eye.\n\nTo outsiders, you'll just be looking at a video on your cellphone.\n\nIf you feel as shy as me, just laugh once in a while so they know you're harmless.\n\nBut not too much laughing!\n\nCholita has a bad habit of cackling like a witch for a good 5 minutes, while eating at Whole Foods.\n\nIt worries the Whole Foods Cougars.\n\nThey don't want to end up like Cholita, but they can feel it's not entirely out of the question.\n\nUnfortunately, moving the head back and forth while staring at the cellphone  is going to make people think you're watching a Stevie Wonder video.\n\nInstead, rock  the cellphone ever so slightly.  Get the sparkle without moving your head at all.\n\nIf anyone's watching that, they'll just think your hands shake a bit.\n\nThere's an added bonus to this, other than that you can do it for a very long time without anyone noticing you.\n\nWithout the head rocking, you can actually feel the effect.\n\nWith the head rocking, it's rather naive afterwards to say, \"Yea man, I can really feel the **energy**.\"\n\nI've seen that, unfortunately.\n\nOne of the Europeans in private classes again.\n\nSorry.\n\nThat's Stevie Wonder energy, from moving the neck.  Tensegrity does that too.\n\nBut if nothing is moving but your hand, and only slightly, you can separate the \"energy\" from the movement.\n\nAnd see if you can feel it.\n\nIf you can't, don't worry. That night is where you'll really notice. If you can get silent.\n\nAs I posted before, the first time I tried that, after decades of forgetting about it, I saw 4 little galaxies floating near the ceiling.\n\nAs I gazed into each one, my assemblage point was pulled all the way into heightened awareness.\n\nIn one second.\n\nIt was like the drop at the start of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland.\n\nIt's a steep drop of a few seconds, into blackness.\n\nUsually moving the assemblage point that far takes at least 2  hours of watching colors.\n\nOr 1 hour of watching  Tensegrity produce a fireworks show.\n\nThe next night, after recharging my eyes again, it was around 1/8th as powerful.\n\nThe next night, there were no little sparkles up there to use.\n\nIt was a gift from *intent*, to let me know that you really can store up energy that way.\n\nSo I guess you could say, this post itself has some *intent* in it.\n\nEdited six times\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cellphone Energy", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"tipcyy2yulu41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 152, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tipcyy2yulu41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7e868ec9a9c6fe08e16a76195980d299349d773"}, {"y": 304, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tipcyy2yulu41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c64b4a65a5c6371e0238c3072d17e913e62f7cdf"}, {"y": 450, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tipcyy2yulu41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01159a713b09e0ef543c5c9cdda37bbee9c00074"}, {"y": 901, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tipcyy2yulu41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7076b821b84a4d2ee15f041af0e68cf6a5146361"}], "s": {"y": 963, "x": 684, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tipcyy2yulu41.jpg?width=684&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d071954cfecf26bac94e247b75e6f127e56fac3"}, "id": "tipcyy2yulu41"}}, "name": "t3_g6rp3g", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/BTikgzdYGjOrUJTcgvjaYvQXUx-y2tgaoYrQcQnQkP0.jpg", "edited": 1587751883.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1587665558.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tipcyy2yulu41.jpg?width=684&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5d071954cfecf26bac94e247b75e6f127e56fac3\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/tipcyy2yulu41.jpg?width=684&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5d071954cfecf26bac94e247b75e6f127e56fac3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ever see one of those yogi guy&amp;#39;s web pages, and the home page is a picture of him in white cotton diapers and nothing else, sitting in lotus position on a mountain top?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And presumably shouting &amp;quot;OOOOMMMMM!!!!&amp;quot;, to show how evolved he is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#39;s not me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I sure hope to God it&amp;#39;s none of you.

It&amp;#39;s a bunch of egos trying to pacify themselves, by getting attention from others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll hear things like, &amp;quot;This is important!  We need to discuss it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No.  It isn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe doing something one or two times ever gives a final answer on a subject.  You probably never get those, until you get to don Juan&amp;#39;s level and can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; what&amp;#39;s actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the sunlight merely summons &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, and you could have brushed your teeth 10 times and gotten the same result, as long as you expected it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe don Genaro made up the sunlight thing, to get La Gorda to do more walking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About avoiding funny looks from other people:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have to be tough warriors, who don&amp;#39;t give a fig about others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s another placebo for the mind, one almost as bad as lusting to be in a lineage,  pumping yourself up on imaginary warrior hood, or being motivated by fame or money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me last night. The most successful people I&amp;#39;ve spoken with are the ones only interested in magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were never interested in the rest of the nonsense.  One I know even considered the story line in the books to be made up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not the techniques, because they work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Magic of course includes Buddhism or Hinduism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most successful are the ones who go straight for practicing, and forget the socializing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should add, Ralph had a baseball cap with hair taped to the sides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d cut his hair very short, because of being in the Sunday class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never asked him why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, the Tensegrity men tended to have very short hair. They didn&amp;#39;t start out that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess it was a sign of dedication?  Maybe Ralph wanted to be in videos too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was his line of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He found it funny to put on that &amp;quot;hair cap&amp;quot;, and drive along Santa Monica Blvd with hippy hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That way people couldn&amp;#39;t see that his hair was so short.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos liked that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t always like student participation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He once showed us how to dig our thumbs into our hipbone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t clear on exactly where, and purchased a full sized medical skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought it to class.  Carlos walked up the stairs, and saw a skeleton around where he usually stood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t like that much.  I&amp;#39;m just happy he didn&amp;#39;t decide it was an omen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited three times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_g6rp3g", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/g6rp3g/cellphone_energy/fofs2hs/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1587741823.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fodujvq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1587690389.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_g6rp3g", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "As someone who lives in a place that's flat and extremely overcast for more than half of the year, this should come in VERY handy.\n\nA lot of pale people where I am!\n\nI'm tempted to say \"fuck 'em\" when worried about funny looks from people...but we all know that automatic momma-instilled anxiety of being identified and scrutinized as deviating from the accepted norms, has its basis in real potentially life threatening persecutions in the past.\n\nAnd what's old often becomes new again.

I could offer assistance or a psychedelic chat or we could wrestle entities (they always seem to want me to fight with them lol) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. There was one dream i had some years ago that, whether through my hubris or wild imagination, it felt like I met a &amp;quot;piece&amp;quot; of what felt like the nagual Carlos Castaneda... just a piece, mind you, like a lone strand detached from the rope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember in his last book, Don Juan says that a nagual, after death, may attain an inorganic being&amp;#39;s form, shedding all vestiges of unnecessary feelings and baggage, and becoming inorganic, the RAW SUM TOTAL OF ONE&amp;#39;S ENERGY, a super enhanced version of themselves, often quite aggressive and forceful in one&amp;#39;s nature due to the boundlessness of their spirit as a nagual... well, in my dream a woman came up to me and showed me a baby wrapped up in her arms, she pushed the baby close to my face, and the baby&amp;#39;s face looked like Castaneda LOL, but an old man in baby form, and then i remember his eyes opening and his face grew large and he was super aggressive, he lashed out, but it was NOT anger, it was like a bolt of lightning, a surge of electricity... It was too powerful for me and i woke up instantly. It was pretty wild ahahaha&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/g6rp3g/cellphone_energy/fom6pkn/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fom6pkn", "created": 1587879900.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1587879900.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "foo3coj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1587931695.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_foo3542", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Good point.

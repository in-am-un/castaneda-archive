Likely he did that talking to plants thing, as a symbol to people to come listen to him, as a replacement for Carlos.&lt;br/&gt;\nWithout the books of Carlos no one would have attended any of his events.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leary was the one who popularized LSD among the hippies. So simply talking about plants does not put you in debt to Castaneda somehow. And of course people would go to hear some guy talk about drugs. If drugs, things that had gotten popular from a lot of different people, were illegal and stigmatized and some guy was traveling around talking about all the crazy experiences he&amp;#39;s had with drugs, people are going to go to see that guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wow...&lt;br/&gt;\nWhy exactly are you in here?&lt;br/&gt;\nI can&amp;#39;t imagine you&amp;#39;ll put in the effort to learn anything.&lt;br/&gt;\nGo smell shit elsewhere?&lt;br/&gt;\nThere are many discussion spots for Castaneda.&lt;br/&gt;\nWhy pick the only one with real magic, and then pretend to be &amp;quot;above it all&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was in response to the statement that all people deep down want to follow the J-curve path, which I think is just not true.

Too much partying.\n\nIn our system, we have mostly \"bad players\".  Meaning, people who don't want sorcery, they want attention from people. If you stick around, you'll see an average of 3 come here each week and have to be asked to go elsewhere.\n\nThat's true of everything.\n\nEven Christians don't really want Christianity.  But try to tell them that!\n\nThat people even in our Castaneda community are full of shit, used to go unnoticed until this subreddit came along.  It went unnoticed, because all other systems out there are 99.9% pretending, and that's socially acceptable.\n\nOur system was likewise mostly pretending, so no one got too hostile over specific aggressive people pretending their sorcery, because they had nothing to compare it to.\n\nNow that we have real magic the pretend stuff not only stands out, but it becomes clear how harmful it is to beginners.\n\nBut that's not so elsewhere.  It's all pretending in most places.\n\nAnd, like I said, we don't know everything.\n\nYou and one other guy posting in the last week or two are having \"too good to be true\" type experiences, and the people in here with knowledge have been at a loss so far.  Just don't know what to say about it.\n\nCould be they're simply having different types of experiences than others.\n\nAs for your stuff, we also have no idea.\n\nNaturally, I can see everything you're talking about, the instant the room lights come off.\n\nMy room is never dark anymore.\n\nI might see endless palm trees, all pressed together.\n\nOr I see people, all crammed together.\n\nI ignore that stuff, but if I focused on it I'm sure it would be more \"interactive\".\n\nMaybe, we've come to the same place Buddhists came, when they decided to create instructions for Buddhist meditation, which hide any possibility of learning magic.\n\nMaybe they just went a little too far telling people to ignore things, because their only real interest is money. Not teaching.\n\nAgain, we just don't know.\n\nNo one has been where we are, for thousands of years.\n\nIf not thousands, certainly no less than hundreds of years.\n\nMeaning, with real magic, and not knowing how to spread it correctly, so that others can share.\n\nI'm reminded of a girlfriend who's mom would \"medicate\" her at 5 years old, with LSD.\n\nShe grew up such that if she closes her eyes, she sees continuous visions.\n\nIn her case, I know she's not making it up because she hates it.  Wants it to go away.\n\nFor you I'd say, there's an important fact you need to get straight.\n\nOlmec sorcery is not something you can learn.\n\nBy focusing on the little men and what you can do with them, you're showing you haven't read around enough in here.\n\nYou don't yet realize, we mean it when we say, you cannot learn this stuff!\n\nYou have to hook to the phantom reality created by those Olmecs, and let it pull you along.\n\nAnd the \"map\" we have to make sure you get the best chance to hook to it, is that J curve map.\n\nIf we knew everything, we might realize you are looking at blue zone magic.  If you look at the J curve, you'll see that the stuff happening in the blue zone on the upper right, is pretty basic.\n\nI have a dot, vague clouds, a single puff.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3](https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3)\n\nBut we all know, in the blue zone (normal consciousness) way more cool things happen!\n\nYou can have a fever and get amazing visions, albeit unpleasant.\n\nWomen can do amazing things in the blue zone, when on their period.\n\nOne day, maybe our J curve map will include some blue zone things, and if someone spots one of them, we'll know what to tell him.\n\nBut no matter what, the destination is on the other side of that diagram, at the purple station.\n\nThat's what sorcery is.  It's not the weird pictures in the middle. Those are just \"sign posts\".\n\nYou have to get over to that purple station at the end, or it's not really sorcery.\n\nWe get confused people come in here thinking sorcery is about getting high. Or impressing others with your tales of consciousness exploration.\n\nIt's not.\n\nIt's the mastery of intent.\n\nThat's sort of like being the \"master of luck\".\n\nYou have 100% luck, all the time.\n\nSo you could randomly toss a rock, and it would land on a valuable object.\n\nThat sort of thing.\n\nOf course, since sorcerers can do anything, they pretty much do nothing.  Except try to pass that knowledge on.\n\nIn your case, find those colored puffs, and ignore the stuff you perceive that is \"off map\".\n\nLater, when you make it into the orange zone, you can explore what that stuff was, and since it will be obvious to all how hard you worked, others will check out what you found too.\n\nAnd we can add it to the map.\n\nBut right now, we have no idea what your motivations are.\n\nOr if you even understand what's going on in here.\n\nAnd since this is the last refuge of real magic for the entire world (as far as anyone can tell), we have to stick to the map.\n\nYou should too.\n\nFrom your point of view, silence is what's important.\n\nSince I didn't hear any complaints from you about how hard that is, and only what you know, and what you saw, I'm having to assume there's a good chance you're looking for attention, and don't have any interest in magic.\n\nBut like I said, we have no idea for now.\n\nGood analysis though!  The three levels.\n\nThe McKenna rantings in your history are worrisome.\n\nMcKenna was a lazy idiot.\n\nHe cashed in on Carlos, without doing any actual work.\n\nAnd gave comfort to very bad drug \"sorcerers\" out there.\n\nBut then I'm not fond of Monroe either.\n\nAnd a lot of people seem to admire him.", "edited": 1633385909.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hfeqgsv", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem here is, this subreddit has only been active a year or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s plenty we don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I hear a new person talking about lots of stuff happening before he can move down the J curve and find the things we know about, I worry it&amp;#39;s a person who&amp;#39;s gotten used to pretending and visualizing, because he&amp;#39;s been practicing pretend things like Buddhism, Daoism, or Magick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or a person who doesn&amp;#39;t care if he&amp;#39;s using drugs to help himself, and won&amp;#39;t mention that to us,  because he thinks it&amp;#39;s irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of our business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe he&amp;#39;s tweaked from drug high obsessions.

If you stick around, you&amp;#39;ll see an average of 3 come here each week and have to be asked to go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s true of everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Christians don&amp;#39;t really want Christianity.  But try to tell them that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That people even in our Castaneda community are full of shit, used to go unnoticed until this subreddit came along.  It went unnoticed, because all other systems out there are 99.9% pretending, and that&amp;#39;s socially acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our system was likewise mostly pretending, so no one got too hostile over specific aggressive people pretending their sorcery, because they had nothing to compare it to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that we have real magic the pretend stuff not only stands out, but it becomes clear how harmful it is to beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s not so elsewhere.  It&amp;#39;s all pretending in most places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, like I said, we don&amp;#39;t know everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You and one other guy posting in the last week or two are having &amp;quot;too good to be true&amp;quot; type experiences, and the people in here with knowledge have been at a loss so far.  Just don&amp;#39;t know what to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be they&amp;#39;re simply having different types of experiences than others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for your stuff, we also have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I can see everything you&amp;#39;re talking about, the instant the room lights come off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My room is never dark anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might see endless palm trees, all pressed together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or I see people, all crammed together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ignore that stuff, but if I focused on it I&amp;#39;m sure it would be more &amp;quot;interactive&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe, we&amp;#39;ve come to the same place Buddhists came, when they decided to create instructions for Buddhist meditation, which hide any possibility of learning magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe they just went a little too far telling people to ignore things, because their only real interest is money. Not teaching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, we just don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one has been where we are, for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not thousands, certainly no less than hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, with real magic, and not knowing how to spread it correctly, so that others can share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m reminded of a girlfriend who&amp;#39;s mom would &amp;quot;medicate&amp;quot; her at 5 years old, with LSD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She grew up such that if she closes her eyes, she sees continuous visions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In her case, I know she&amp;#39;s not making it up because she hates it.  Wants it to go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For you I&amp;#39;d say, there&amp;#39;s an important fact you need to get straight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Olmec sorcery is not something you can learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By focusing on the little men and what you can do with them, you&amp;#39;re showing you haven&amp;#39;t read around enough in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t yet realize, we mean it when we say, you cannot learn this stuff!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to hook to the phantom reality created by those Olmecs, and let it pull you along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;quot;map&amp;quot; we have to make sure you get the best chance to hook to it, is that J curve map.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we knew everything, we might realize you are looking at blue zone magic.  If you look at the J curve, you&amp;#39;ll see that the stuff happening in the blue zone on the upper right, is pretty basic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a dot, vague clouds, a single puff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we all know, in the blue zone (normal consciousness) way more cool things happen!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can have a fever and get amazing visions, albeit unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women can do amazing things in the blue zone, when on their period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day, maybe our J curve map will include some blue zone things, and if someone spots one of them, we&amp;#39;ll know what to tell him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no matter what, the destination is on the other side of that diagram, at the purple station.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what sorcery is.  It&amp;#39;s not the weird pictures in the middle. Those are just &amp;quot;sign posts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to get over to that purple station at the end, or it&amp;#39;s not really sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We get confused people come in here thinking sorcery is about getting high. Or impressing others with your tales of consciousness exploration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the mastery of intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s sort of like being the &amp;quot;master of luck&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have 100% luck, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you could randomly toss a rock, and it would land on a valuable object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, since sorcerers can do anything, they pretty much do nothing.  Except try to pass that knowledge on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In your case, find those colored puffs, and ignore the stuff you perceive that is &amp;quot;off map&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later, when you make it into the orange zone, you can explore what that stuff was, and since it will be obvious to all how hard you worked, others will check out what you found too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we can add it to the map.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But right now, we have no idea what your motivations are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if you even understand what&amp;#39;s going on in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And since this is the last refuge of real magic for the entire world (as far as anyone can tell), we have to stick to the map.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From your point of view, silence is what&amp;#39;s important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I didn&amp;#39;t hear any complaints from you about how hard that is, and only what you know, and what you saw, I&amp;#39;m having to assume there&amp;#39;s a good chance you&amp;#39;re looking for attention, and don&amp;#39;t have any interest in magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But like I said, we have no idea for now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good analysis though!

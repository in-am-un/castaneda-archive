You can imagine what she'd assume.\n\nAnd the \"Little Sisters\" did!\n\nBut don Juan tried to \"cure\" him by pointing out, he could just write his notes in the air, and read them back from there later.\n\nHere's how you do that.\n\nDon't any beginners fall prey to the \"superman effect\".\n\nIt's very ugly.\n\nIt comes from being saturated with such evil men as \"Mantak Chia\", \"Chopra\", or just about any \"high up person\" in a magical system.\n\nAll implying they can repeat any magic they ever saw.\n\nWhich actually isn't much.\n\nThat's not REAL magic.\n\nReal magic is very hard to repeat, until you are so far out there, you almost don't exist anymore.\n\nWhich is NONE of the famous magic leaders out there.  Virtually all of those, wouldn't even qualify as a good beginner in here.\n\nThe Buddha himself would only be a mediocre beginner with serious delusions holding him back from further progress.\n\nReal magic is super rare.\n\nIt didn't used to be that way.\n\nBoth don Juan and Carlos were curious about \"what went wrong\" on planet earth, such that all magic was destroyed.\n\nYou've seen my theories, but lately they have zeroed in on bad men.\n\nNot the women. They got suppressed by the bad men, with sayings such as \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\".\n\nOr with pointless \"endorsements\" by frauds like the Dali Lama or Yogananda.\n\nThey create a fake system that insists you aren't doing anything important, unless the big guy at the top gets his 10% cut.\n\nSo women in the bathtub trying to soothe their monthly cramps, who go all out on it with $50 worth of amazing smelling flowers, and flickering scented candles all around the bath, plus Cholita's favorite of some pink champagne, don't realize how far they go into magical realms on some days.\n\nThey can \"soothe\" themselves all the way to the end of  the J curve!\n\nBut it's VERY difficult to remember that, if you only zipped over there on a visit.\n\nAnd it feels \"unreal\" to normal people.  You have to get used to how that \"feels\" out there.\n\nThen on top of that you get some delusional Hindu crap magic recycler like \"The Buddha\", with 4 evil close associates to \"franchise the whole thing\", creating a giant temple system running crime all over Asia.\n\nAnd redefining magic to be some male thing, that's actually not even true at all.\n\nSuch as \"permanent enlightenment\".\n\nWith eyes closed and a huge grin???\n\nAre you serious?\n\nWomen know the truth.  You usually don't grin like that, unless you want something from others.\n\nBut there you have it. Their magic disrespected and their own existence marginalized with the crazy idea women are only for making babies, and normal women who experience magic by accident never decide to pursue it.\n\nIt's what Taisha's been saying about how men have stripped the power from women, with constant brainwashing.\n\nBut the men aren't any better off!  They're so greedy to kiss the Dalai Lama's big bird hat in a photo op,  that they never even try to learn the real thing.\n\nWhat a mess.\n\nThe kind of magic you see here is done AWAKE, VERY SOBER, must be done with your eyes open, moving around doing tensegrity, and in perfect silence.\n\nNot verbal silence.  You can speak all you want!\n\nYuu just don't get to think in words.\n\nThose are like waving your arm the way the person does in this picture, to summon a phantom castle he's seen before.\n\nHis arm wave \"summons\" it.\n\nLikewise, every single word in your internal dialogue is like waving your arm, \"knowing\" what that summons.\n\nExcept our internal dialogue always summons the same shit.\n\n\"Oh poor me.  How can I bear all this?\"\n\nIf you keep on that path you have nothing to look forward to in life, but losses.\n\nIf you learn magic, you have more magic and more power and more freedom to look forward to.\n\nEven if you get too old for Hallmark Movie Channel romance comedies.\n\nAlthough I'll tell the young people a little secret.\n\nThere's a lot of sexually transmitted diseases in retirement communities.\n\nLots...\n\nMore to look forward to?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Another Thing You Can Do", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"khelhlfkorka1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/khelhlfkorka1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23bf72adc4018bf7185b839096d54fe404f87459"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/khelhlfkorka1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=552a8084d0756eb49ddbf376d7a114cf8512d7e8"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/khelhlfkorka1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3ef4bdcb336fd1b29b2fc302b99d1ded9c167f3"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/khelhlfkorka1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40f29f7b567586761626d19f7177c50ef70e4235"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/khelhlfkorka1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6681a8bbd72988a795df07399bd159c1cda946d1"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/khelhlfkorka1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9eb068f6a9dfc28ca1e085857f9cf576106156f0"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/khelhlfkorka1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f7524f863222fd9ad1480c738e64fce2b5af13e"}, "id": "khelhlfkorka1"}}, "name": "t3_11di214", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/N1T7nu5kSyLOjrpm6GvD4WIwV509R-dIjuS4kTCFuYw.jpg", "edited": 1677524812.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1677520443.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/khelhlfkorka1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2f7524f863222fd9ad1480c738e64fce2b5af13e\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/khelhlfkorka1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2f7524f863222fd9ad1480c738e64fce2b5af13e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a technique you can try, when you can make it to the purple zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same thing don Juan suggested to Carlos, about writing in the air with his finger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was constantly taking notes, afraid he&amp;#39;d lose something important that don Juan or the apprentices said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He even hid a notepad in his pocket, and was scribbling on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t try that around Cholita...

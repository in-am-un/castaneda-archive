I am wayy better when I put things in writings, to express something, for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, like you said, it doesn&amp;#39;t even make it easier for me to shut down my internal dialogue, even if its not &amp;quot;words&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s still &amp;quot;urges&amp;quot;, or like &amp;quot;waves of impressions&amp;quot;, etc. and they&amp;#39;re all very much OF this world (from my own experiences or what I&amp;#39;ve been exposed to, feelings I&amp;#39;ve hold unto, etc).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only difference I THINK is that I can get &amp;quot;absent-minded&amp;quot; alot during the day and my focus shifts very easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if this resonates with someone else here ?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_hc9gtn", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hc9gtn/people_are_weirded_out_to_discover_that_some/fve0lgj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1592609390.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fvgohkg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fvgbtn2", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "No, it could be an evolutionary diversion.\n\nYou'd have to assume, there are genetic variations in how the brain works.\n\nOtherwise we'd still be neanderthals.\n\nWhich might actually be nicer.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fvgohkg", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, it could be an evolutionary diversion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d have to assume, there are genetic variations in how the brain works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise we&amp;#39;d still be neanderthals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which might actually be nicer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_hc9gtn", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hc9gtn/people_are_weirded_out_to_discover_that_some/fvgohkg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1592678116.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1592678116.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fvgbtn2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "couchbutt", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1592671148.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fvdyfhg", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_txn1k", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;Yea, it's puzzling.\n\n&gt;What holds them to this view of the world?\n\n\nWell if someone is different than the norm, they must be evil and perverse!

I thought the \"Energy Body\" was just the non-solid view of the dreaming double.\n\nNothing could be more wrong!\n\nHere's how it goes:  Tonal body (your solid body) can be used to form an \"Energy Body\", which is an energy only copy of yourself.  You can switch back and forth by gazing down and to the right of the stomach, as reported in Eagle's Gift, when Silvio Manuel teaches Carlos, right after Zuleica gets him to finish the \"wiggling fingers\", and fold in half thing.\n\nIt can both teleport, and also be invisible.  So you end up like \"the flash\".\n\nHow cool!\n\n\"The Energy body\" has nothing to do with the double, who is somewhere out there lost in infinity, while you are doing those things.\n\nProbably I was confused by the \"Luminous Shell\", which is basically what traps the emanations inside  us.  That contains everything we are, both tonal, energy body, and double.\n\nNow, if you play around in the dark room, trying to form the energy body (the ultimate goal), the double can't help but notice.\n\nAnd he comes back from whereever he is, to take a look.\n\nWe see that happen in the dark room. For instance, you suddenly have 3 arms.\n\nThe \"double\" on the other hand, is sort of the opposite of the \"energy body\".  We have a second copy of ourselves out there.\n\nFor some people, not so far out there.  Cholita for example.  It \"comes around\" to visit.\n\nAt any rate, whether your \"double\" comes around, or is lost in infinity, using 4 gates dreaming we go into an ordinary dream to merge with him, take conscious control, and eventually bring it out into the real world.  And we make it solid enough there, to function as another copy of \"us\".\n\nDarkroom gazing can used to do both, but so can other methods.  I'll make a picture showing some,  because people on instagram like the pictures and they tend to be younger.  Younger has more energy!\n\nBut older works harder.  And has nothing to lose.\n\nAll the pics are starting to show up in google searches!  We're getting closer to overwhelming the negative info on Carlos.\n\nAnd making the phony \"sorcery teacher\" pages look silly.\n\nHere's what I got in chat, when I asked about this topic.  Cruz and Techno.  They still didn't find me the missing quote I wanted, but these will have to do.\n\nWho knows... I might have seen that missing quote on the \"other\" reddit.  The one intent runs.  I still get notifications from there.

A ghostlike configuration made of pure energy.\" \"But isn't the physical body also made out of energy?\" \"Of course it is. The difference is that the energy body has only appearance but no mass. Since it's pure energy, it can perform acts that are beyond the possibilities of the physical body.\" \"Such as what for example, don Juan?\" \"Such as transporting itself in one instant to the ends of the universe. And dreaming is the art of tempering the energy body, of making it supple and coherent by gradually exercising it. \"Through dreaming we condense the energy body until it's a unit capable of perceiving.

And it is said to have two separate halves, a left and right side, with distinctly different currents.And a set of or one single tentacle(s) amongst multiple other distinct energy structures within it, vortices and whatnot. Some people have extra pools of light around the diaphragm, others give off a pulses etc.This page offers the best passages from the book Magical Passes describing how are energy is stuck on the periphery and needs to be brought back to the center.\n\n[http://www.uazone.org/naph/ccarlos/books/cc10/tensegrity10.html](http://www.uazone.org/naph/ccarlos/books/cc10/tensegrity10.html)\n\n\"The natural tendency of human beings,\" he said, \"is to push energy away from the centers of vitality, which are located on the right side of the body, right at the edge of the rib cage on the area of the liver and gallbladder; on the left side of the body, again, at the edge of the rib cage, on the area of the pancreas and spleen; on the back, right behind the other two centers, around the kidneys, and right above them, on the area of the adrenal glands; at the base of the neck on the V spot made by the sternum and clavicle; and around the uterus and ovaries in women.\"  \"How do human beings push this energy away, don Juan?\" I asked.  \"By worrying,\" he replied. \"By succumbing to the stress of everyday life.

They agitate the energy that has been accumulated in the luminous ball and return it to the physical body itself. The magical passes engage both the body itself as a physical entity that suffers the dispersion of energy, and the body as an energetic entity which is capable of redeploying that dispersed energy.  \"Having energy on the periphery of the luminous ball,\" he continued, it energy that is not being redeployed, is as useless as not having any energy at all. It is truly a terrifying situation to have a surplus of energy stashed away, inaccessible for all practical purposes. It is like being in the desert, dying of dehydration, while you carry a tank of water that you cannot open, because you don't have any tools. In that desert, you can't even find a rock to bang it with.\"  The true magic of the magical passes is the fact that they cause crusted-down energy to enter again into the centers of vitality, hence the feeling of well-being and prowess which is the practitioner's experience.\"\n\nI put the dreaming double passage in the public chat group.\n\nTechno:\n\nThis webpage has a passage from The Eagles gift on the dreaming double:  [https://www.lecturesbureau.gr/1/what-drives-the-energy-of-our-total-existence-is-known-as-will-1451/](https://www.lecturesbureau.gr/1/what-drives-the-energy-of-our-total-existence-is-known-as-will-1451/)\n\n\"Don Juan had described dreaming to me in various ways. The most obscure of them all now appears to me as being the one that defines it best. He said that dreaming is intrinsically the not-doing of sleep. And as such, dreaming affords practitioners the use of that portion of their lives spent in slumber. It is as if the dreamers no longer sleep; yet no illness results from it. The dreamers do not lack sleep, and the effect of dreaming seems to be an increase of waking time owing to the use of an alleged extra body; the dreaming body.  Don Juan had explained to me that the dreaming body is sometimes called the \u201cdouble\u201d or the \u201cother\u201d because it is a perfect replica of the dreamer\u2019s body. It is inherently the energy of a luminous being, a whitish, phantomlike emanation which is projected by the fixation of the second attention into a three-dimensional image of the body. Don Juan explained that the dreaming body is not a ghost, and is as real as anything we deal with in the world. He said that the second attention is unavoidably drawn to focus on our total being as a field of energy, and transforms that energy into anything suitable. The easiest thing is, of course, the image of the physical body with which we are already thoroughly familiar from our daily lives, and our use of our first attention. And that which channels the energy of our total being to produce anything that might be within the boundaries of possibility is known as \u2018will\u2019. Don Juan could not say what those boundaries were; except that at the level of luminous beings, the range is so broad that it is futile to try to establish limits. Thus, the energy of a luminous being can be transformed through will into anything.  \u201cThe Nagual said that the dreaming body gets involved and attaches itself to anything,\u201d Benigno said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have sense. He told me that men are weaker than women because a man\u2019s dreaming body is more possessive.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSomeone else was asking about \"will\" and not satisfied when I pointed to an inspirational quote about how we \"fuse\" to \"intent\", and become something else, which has \"will\" working with intent, to make things happen the way we want.\n\n\"Will\" is another of those topics people get excited about, because of that waterfall thing.\n\nSo in that last paragraph, we have yet another definition of what will is.\n\nI was claiming no reason to think about it much, because dark room gazing makes you the master of intent when you learn to move fully to silent knowledge.  And that's when will automatically comes into power.\n\nApparently not completely accurate, according to that last quote.\n\nWhich goes to show how we argue over inventory items. And it can be very interesting!\n\nBut nothing like actually doing those things yourself.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Tonal Body, Energy Body, Dreaming body, Double.

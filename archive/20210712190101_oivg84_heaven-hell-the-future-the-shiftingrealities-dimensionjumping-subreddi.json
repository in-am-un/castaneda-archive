Catholics, Buddhists, Yogis, Taoists, Mystics, and even small animals. The next time you see your dog\u2019s legs twitching as she sleeps, she was probably using this technique. It's extremely simple: you fall asleep but retain consciousness, and look through the beginnings of the second attention, which manifest in front of your closed eyes....\n\n... you could do this for Taoism (and they do), Buddhism (they relish in it), or even Satanism (they\u2019re probably naked).\n\nYou lie on your side in bed (or otherwise), eyes closed, and you begin to contemplate the creation of the universe. For a Christian, it might go like this:\n\n\u201cGod created the universe saying, let there be light. And there WAS light. And it was good. Then he formed the people of the earth, intending to lead them to righteousness, so that they could take their place in heaven. But Eve partook of the serpent, and Adam joined in. Finding themselves naked, they covered their genitals with fig leaves and ...\u201d\n\nOk, maybe you can modify yours to be a little better...\n\n... As you lie on your side, you\u2019ll begin to fall asleep. But the continuous repetition of your \u201cstory\u201d will move your assemblage point just a tiny amount, into heightened awareness.\n\nAs don Juan said, \u201cmoving the AP is very difficult and yet it's the simplest thing in the world\u2026 mysticism, high fever, hunger, fear, love or hate could do it and also unbending intent, which is the preferred method of sorcerers.\n\nBut\u2026 \u201cThe best way to make a hit on the second attention is through ritual acts\u201d\n\nAs you engage in your repetitious ritual act of contemplative meditation, the second attention will activate. If you\u2019ve done a good job of sticking to the script, your assemblage point will have moved far enough into heightened awareness to help you remain awake, as you activate the second attention (*dreaming*).\"\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nThe other half of this polarity in the human inventory is hell:\n\n\"A guy who said he literally experienced hell has recounted his memory of what happened when he was allegedly trapped in the underworld for 23 minutes. Watch him explain what happened:\n\nBill Wiese has recalled what happened when in November 1998, he got up at 3am to get a drink.\n\nDespite thinking he was just heading to the fridge, he actually briefly visited the middle of the earth, where he said he heard 'millions of people screaming' in the depths of hell.\n\nHe describes the whole thing as an out-of-body experience, saying he was pulled from his body and travelled to hell through a long tunnel.\n\nSpeaking to Christian broadcaster TCT Network, Bill said: \"It was getting hotter and hotter and I landed on a stone floor in a prison cell in hell.\n\n\"There were stone walls, bars it was more like a dungeon - a filthy, stinking, smoke filled dungeon.\"\n\nI'm sure we've all experienced that at 3am once or twice.\n\nHe continued: \"The heat was so unbearable, I wondered how could I be alive. Why am I here, how did I get here?\"\n\nHe said he then saw two enormous demons in the cell, saying they were pacing around the cell.\n\nThe creatures, who had a 'ferocious demeanour', were blaspheming, according to Bill.\n\nHe explained: \"And then they directed this hatred they had towards god towards me. One demon picked me up and threw me into the wall of this prison cell. I felt as if bones had broken. Now I know a spirit doesn't have bones, but it felt that way.\n\n\"I wondered why am I still alive through this. The other demon dug its claws into my chest and just tore the flesh open. This is actually happening.\"\n\nHe said the prison cell then was lit up, with what he believed to be god's presence there, before it was plunged into darkness again.\n\nAs if all that wasn't bad enough, he was taken out of his prison cell and put next to a random pit of fire.\n\nBut, it wasn't metaphorical flames, he assures us, it was 'real fire'.\n\nThis is where he could first see people.\n\nHe said he saw 'thousands of people in this pit, screaming and burning', adding that they looked like skeletons.\n\nHe said there were various degrees of punishment and he was kept in isolation, adding 'the stench in hell is the most foul, putrid disgusting odour'. He likens it to sewers and burning sulphur and it's toxic to inhale.\n\nDoesn't sound ideal, does it?\n\nLuckily, Bill was returned to earth safely and ended up w**riting a book called 23 Minutes In Hell, which went on to sell more than a million copies**.

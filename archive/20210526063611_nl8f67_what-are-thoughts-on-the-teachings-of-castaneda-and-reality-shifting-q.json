The thread I read said that the movie is remembered as: Houston we have a problem, but in reality it says Houston We've Had a Problem. \n\nI remembered : Houston we have a problem. My wife and I went to youtube, we watched and verified : a calm, cool, collected Tom Hanks said: Houston, We've Had a Problem. It was nothing like I remembered. I chalked it up to false memories, it's been decades since I saw the film...I watched it a couple more times though to be sure, and to form a memory of it. In case flip-flops were real. \n\nFour days later: I was reading more on mandela effects, and I read that many remember Houston We've Had a Problem but it's really Houston we Have a Problem in the Tom Hanks movie. I'm thinking that has to be a typo. I go and double check... I watched versions from: Universtal Studios and two different movie-clips/review channels. It now was a different scene, completely different. My wife can attest. Tom Hanks in a much more dramatic/panicked tone says: Uhh... Houston, we have a problem!! \n\nIt's not a minor change, it changes the entire scene. Sure, you can believe or not believe, but you're in a sorcery sub, my belief in reality changing went from 90% (Fruit of the loom cornucopia, and objects in mirror may appear closer than they are, are too big ones for me as well, but I could chalk that to false memories). \n\nIf you watched a video today, with 100% intent and focus on an exact line, and you double checked it 3 times, and it changed tomorrow. Would you think, damn my memory sucks, or damn there must be an alternate version (there isn't), or damn ..I don't know WTF is happening, but something is up...or you're going insane, you're in a covid-19 coma, or maybe reality isn't real as we perceive it. \n\nMaybe reality is a consensus -- if the majority think it's one way it remains that way, if not then it's another... because we're all connected... something I think people practicing sorcery could get behind, unless they're just larping or pretending in which case I'm in the wrong place for trying to \"discover\" why I saw what I saw. \n\nIf you entangle particles quantumly and split them so that the entangled pair splatter against a wall and afterwards you track which slit they went through, you'll find that if you track particles after the effect, the wave will break down and they become single particles, in other words observation of reality controls whether you get a single particles hitting a wall, or an interference/wave pattern. However, it defies time, because entangled particles behave the way their entangled pair works, so the twin particle knows if it was observed or not EVEN if it was observed in the future, and it behaves as though it already knows the outcome. \n\nIn other words retro-causality, in quantum mechanics you can have effect before the cause. \n\nA good video on how this works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spKlpexL_Hg\n\nA cognitive scientist (Dennis Hoffman) claims he has proof (mathematically) that we're living in a simulation. \n\nSources: \n\n- [Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYp5XuGYqqY)\n- [Interview 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJukJiNEl4o)\n- [Interview 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehz89eV5JR4)\n- [Youtube search](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=donald+hoffman)\n\nThe interviews are 2 hours each, but cover a shit ton of the theory. \n\nI'm very grounded in science: Vaccines do not cause autism, nor do they have microchips, and 5G isn't gonna hurt anyone, everyone should get the covid vaccine, I have and unless I'm dead - there were no side effects lasting more than 24 hours.

Houston, we have a problem!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a minor change, it changes the entire scene. Sure, you can believe or not believe, but you&amp;#39;re in a sorcery sub, my belief in reality changing went from 90% (Fruit of the loom cornucopia, and objects in mirror may appear closer than they are, are too big ones for me as well, but I could chalk that to false memories). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you watched a video today, with 100% intent and focus on an exact line, and you double checked it 3 times, and it changed tomorrow. Would you think, damn my memory sucks, or damn there must be an alternate version (there isn&amp;#39;t), or damn ..I don&amp;#39;t know WTF is happening, but something is up...or you&amp;#39;re going insane, you&amp;#39;re in a covid-19 coma, or maybe reality isn&amp;#39;t real as we perceive it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe reality is a consensus -- if the majority think it&amp;#39;s one way it remains that way, if not then it&amp;#39;s another... because we&amp;#39;re all connected... something I think people practicing sorcery could get behind, unless they&amp;#39;re just larping or pretending in which case I&amp;#39;m in the wrong place for trying to &amp;quot;discover&amp;quot; why I saw what I saw. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you entangle particles quantumly and split them so that the entangled pair splatter against a wall and afterwards you track which slit they went through, you&amp;#39;ll find that if you track particles after the effect, the wave will break down and they become single particles, in other words observation of reality controls whether you get a single particles hitting a wall, or an interference/wave pattern. However, it defies time, because entangled particles behave the way their entangled pair works, so the twin particle knows if it was observed or not EVEN if it was observed in the future, and it behaves as though it already knows the outcome. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words retro-causality, in quantum mechanics you can have effect before the cause. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good video on how this works: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spKlpexL_Hg\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spKlpexL_Hg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A cognitive scientist (Dennis Hoffman) claims he has proof (mathematically) that we&amp;#39;re living in a simulation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sources: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYp5XuGYqqY\"&gt;Ted Talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJukJiNEl4o\"&gt;Interview 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehz89eV5JR4\"&gt;Interview 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=donald+hoffman\"&gt;Youtube search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The interviews are 2 hours each, but cover a shit ton of the theory. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very grounded in science: Vaccines do not cause autism, nor do they have microchips, and 5G isn&amp;#39;t gonna hurt anyone, everyone should get the covid vaccine, I have and unless I&amp;#39;m dead - there were no side effects lasting more than 24 hours.  Global warming does exist, but if reality changed, would you know?

A team of geneticists and  anthropologists published an article in *Science*  on Tuesday that traces Native Americans to a single group that settled  in what\u2019s now America far later than what scientists previously thought.\n\nThe  researchers looked at sequenced DNA from bones as well as the sequenced  genomes of Native American volunteers with heritage from not only the  Americas but also Siberia and Oceania, says according to Rasmus Nielsen,  a computational geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley,  and one of the authors of the study. The researchers contacted people  whose heritage indicated they were of Amerindian or Athanbascan\u2014the two  ethnic derivations of Native Americans\u2014descent. Specifically, they  looked at their mitochondrial DNA (mDNA), which is passed from mother to  child.\n\nWhat they found fundamentally changes what scientists previously  thought. The team found that Native Americans most likely had a common  Siberian origin, contradicting theories that an earlier migration from  Europe occurred.\n\nThe timeline Rasmus and his colleagues propose goes something like this:  About 23,000 years ago, a single group splintered off from an East  Asian population. The group, hailing from northeast Asia, crossed the  Bering Land Bridge between northeast Asia and Alaska, eventually making  their way to the rest of the Americas. About 13,000 years ago\u2014much more  recent than previous theories\u2014Native Americans started to split into  different groups, creating the genetic and cultural diversity that  exists today.\n\n\u201cWe can refute that people moved into Alaska 35,000 years ago,\u201d  Rasmus says. \u201cThey came much more recently, and it all happened  relatively fast.\u201d\n\nRasmus\u2019 team\u2019s theory  contradicts another line of thought, which points to two different  populations coming from Siberia, settling in the Americas more than  15,000 years ago.\n\nDavid Reich, a senior author of a different *Nature* paper detailing the competing theory and a professor at Harvard, told the New York *Times*  that their results were \u201csurprising\u201d: \u201cWe have overwhelming evidence of  two founding populations in the Americas,\u201d he said. Reich\u2019s group  divides the migration groups into two: one is the First Americans, and  another they identify as Population Y, which \u201ccarried ancestry more  closely related to indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andaman  Islanders than to any present-day Eurasians or Native Americans.\u201d\n\nDespite  their differences, both groups agree on the notion that Native  Americans can trace their ancestry to Eurasian migrants with  Australasian ancestry.\n\nRasmus emphasizes that  their team\u2019s new findings don\u2019t close the case. But as simple as the  finding seems to be, Rasmus says it is truly astonishing. \u201cThe original  hypothesis isn\u2019t true,\u201d he says. \u201cAll Native Americans are descendants  of one migration wave.\u201d", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Siberian Shamanism Is Our Source?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Lineage"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 91, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"24g3cd7omwl71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 70, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/24g3cd7omwl71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=075087e21f041d6a8fec528cc257ffda00c9e7aa"}, {"y": 141, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/24g3cd7omwl71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9fbb5715931accc1d28227ca956bc3e16dc8063"}, {"y": 209, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/24g3cd7omwl71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb20cb90831f4741d1ebc2b86d27a24eeed81719"}], "s": {"y": 335, "x": 511, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/24g3cd7omwl71.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d86baf757dc5590da5d018012f205a3c9c41c030"}, "id": "24g3cd7omwl71"}}, "name": "t3_pj24nd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 11, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Lineage", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/rASDr8r5gqWhU2n3hcSVhpcLxgNhQwUEZRcnyC9fjVQ.jpg", "edited": 1630944069.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1630943735.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/24g3cd7omwl71.png?width=511&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d86baf757dc5590da5d018012f205a3c9c41c030\"&gt;Mesoamerica not populated from Alaska?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://time.com/3964634/native-american-origin-theory/\"&gt;https://time.com/3964634/native-american-origin-theory/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m surprised to see this.

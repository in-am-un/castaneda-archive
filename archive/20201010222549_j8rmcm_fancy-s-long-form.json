I didn't understand at the time. I was concerned with using her to push people into heightened awareness. I tried forming her into various shapes, which I could use at gatherings.  The most spectacular was a \"Headless Horseman\" pumpkin I could toss at the wall.  The idea was that it might be able to push assemblage points.\n\nWhile perfecting that, I discovered that simply playing with the blobs of light accomplished the very thing I was seeking.  At that point it became obvious: Carlos had been instructing us on that very thing, just before he died. I suppose he decided it was time, and that being cautious was more dangerous than unleashing IOBs on us.\n\nAnd so an inorganic being revived the Castaneda community by teaching me \"puffery\", the same way inorganic beings taught Carlos from the beginning, as Little Smoke, Mescalito, and Devil's Weed.\n\nBy the way: Theory.   Mescalito was one of Vicente's inorganic beings.  Didn't he plant things to get inorganic beings to show up for Carlos?  Wasn't he a famous curer in the north?  Wouldn't a famous curer be the leader of peyote sessions?\n\nWell, it's just a theory. I can't visualize Fairy stretching her face like that, and Minx is too weird to behave in such an orderly fashion.\n\nAnd now it's \"Fancy's\" turn to help, seeing as how Juann is hogging Fairy.\n\nAnd Fairy doesn't seem to mind trading me for younger people.  The rest of my lifespan is barely enough time for Fairy to get in a good yawn,  in her own world.\n\nFortunately, Fancy burns hotter.  And teaches obsessively.  My cellphone is filled with notes each morning, taken the night before.  Each \"fine tuning\" she makes, seems designed to feed her the most energy possible.  And yet, doing that produces amazing results for me.  There's certainly nothing to complain about.\n\nFancy also has proven she has at least a 2 hour short term memory.    I wish mine were as good!\n\nIf I Jokingly request something (*sexy*...), she keeps track and does it when appropriate, even if I've completely forgotten about it.  And she draws on the \"archetype\" for what I asked.  God only knows how she understands such things.\n\nFor example, if you ask her for some beef chow fun, she's liable to show up with a Cantonese wok, instead of the Mandarin wok people in my area are used to seeing.\n\nEven if you never thought such a thing.\n\nHer long form was supposed to enhance wiggling the fingers at the point of the second attention, since Zuleica's technique is not finished until we can change into our second attention energy body on demand, and move around.\n\nI had hoped to reduce the 800 hours Carlos might have spent wiggling his fingers, to 50 hours using her technique.  But that remains to be seen.\n\nAs you can see in the picture, it certainly does \"enhance\" wiggling the fingers.  The dirty yellow is particularly good for producing spectacular effects.\n\nWhat you see there, is what I did last night. And I've adjusted the brightness and colors to be as accurate as possible, so I don't mislead anyone.\n\nIt really, really does look like that. Magic right in your face, with your eyes open, fully awake.  I even heard Cholita banging around, and it made no difference how many doors she slammed.\n\nBut there is an odd side effect.\n\nI seem to end up in Fancy's ice cave every time I stop to rest, sitting up on the pillows to gaze at energy on the walls.\n\nShe scared me a bit last night, forcing me to view a series of vertical lines, which looked like a cage. I had an instant spark of fright, realizing if I had to look at those too long I'd go mad.\n\nBut then I relaxed and resigned myself to go mad, and they went away.\n\nInstead, I saw a little flurry of lights, against the wall of her ice cave.\n\nI didn't know if it was an inorganic being, but since I was already there I used my palm to push and pull on it.\n\nOnce I did that a hideous little dwarf formed, and I gently guided him towards me, and away from me by merely waving my palm. No need to touch.\n\nNote: Her ice cave was barely visible that time. It hadn't finished forming from the energy on the walls.    But even in \"dim\" condition, I could still push on pull on entities there.  And in so doing, it got vivid and bright.\n\nSo don't doubt what you see. Just make use any way  you can.  Your mom isn't got to chastise you if you get something wrong, the way she does if you drop something while helping her in the kitchen.\n\nSo go ahead and make mistakes. You have my permission. If you get criticized later by a genuine cleargreen insider, you can send them to me and I'll ask where they've been all these years!\n\nThis morning, I'm plagued with objects falling and bumping in the empty office and warehouse.  So dim as it might be, it still worked.\n\nIt's not even worth bothering to see what's up anymore.  The sounds are unique, never occurred before, and are almost surely Fancy showing me the benefit of visiting her world.\n\nWood. Fancy seems to like to push on wood.\n\nI'll have to flee posting here again, if we get another angry visitor.  Hopefully things will be calm a while.\n\nBut me being in here, is like  having the \"fastest gun in the west\" in your saloon.\n\nThe others who want to be the fastest, will come in shooting.\n\nAnd it's such a nice bar!  Not good if it gets shot up too much.\n\nThe people who've gotten good at darkroom gazing have all noticed, it goes better when there's no \"counter *intent*\" here.  So please don't message me and tell me to ignore the bad people.\n\nThey're out to destroy, and they seem to have a little power to harm others as they try to promote themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Fancy's Long Form", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "link_ids": ["t3_ifu1bv", "t3_if5koq", "t3_ienqgj", "t3_ie01zd", "t3_idn0fa", "t3_idh7ju", "t3_iczlw5", "t3_icv2ot", "t3_irms6p", "t3_irglig", "t3_iqzit7", "t3_iq7jdg", "t3_iof5ib", "t3_invu3w", "t3_imlozg", "t3_ilzfhg", "t3_ildkri", "t3_ijgd33", "t3_iixdqk", "t3_ihms98", "t3_ih21eh", "t3_ih44uo", "t3_igh7ta", "t3_igday4", "t3_jcxlwj", "t3_hp41du", "t3_kdsew2", "t3_kz7y8a", "t3_kz75ql", "t3_kw4lpr", "t3_kvqj52", "t3_knpzzc", "t3_km2pzf", "t3_kj29l8", "t3_kd0b1h", "t3_k641wo", "t3_k4jrfq", "t3_k2paj7", "t3_k2dn7a", "t3_k1fwwj", "t3_jqlctf", "t3_jq09jk", "t3_jp4g2x", "t3_jng0bx", "t3_jmu5w3", "t3_jmsrw3", "t3_jm1fxl", "t3_jkklgr", "t3_jikxdd", "t3_jhb6f9", "t3_jh8142", "t3_jglh8m", "t3_jgb5mx", "t3_jg53re", "t3_jfoaai", "t3_jf4c1u", "t3_je4gyw", "t3_jdlcth", "t3_jby6ff", "t3_jadwdo", "t3_j9fkih", "t3_j96xwg", "t3_j8rmcm", "t3_j7c8fa", "t3_j65s10", "t3_j61w6p", "t3_j43yai", "t3_j40bem", "t3_j3eykq", "t3_j2jxyx", "t3_j261xv", "t3_j1vngl", "t3_j0g2nl", "t3_izm9cx", "t3_iyhkny", "t3_ix9ipe", "t3_ix5a4g", "t3_iw29ja", "t3_iverkv", "t3_iu3yxd", "t3_isv81g", "t3_isnn0y", "t3_ic1ppo", "t3_i9fbj8", "t3_i8kcue", "t3_i795h6", "t3_i5o2m4", "t3_i4tqjj", "t3_i3o4mq", "t3_i2ha3h", "t3_i1ch4u", "t3_i0s7jm", "t3_hzfk4m", "t3_hx8xej", "t3_iyz5md", "t3_ljjdbn", "t3_lfo0wa", "t3_lgzmsv"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 1", "created_at_utc": 1598295005.319, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1620558726.961, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"po76c4ssrbs51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/po76c4ssrbs51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=690b927f897ddc757fc4d90c2eff264c25b481cc"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/po76c4ssrbs51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29217f5ce72a8d9a9e6cc6af5a100cc4edd80ec0"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/po76c4ssrbs51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abd708dc8df7001748256aded1a02d992d176782"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/po76c4ssrbs51.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cc8e03b6465dd41a717fb4412cc29c19444f0f4"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/po76c4ssrbs51.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5f75d2c74b9938203250dbdce1a12c8220d5381"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/po76c4ssrbs51.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94734abfb7b883a461e1941b15e1a8555372ae79"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/po76c4ssrbs51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=987acdb3b31822b63b5f66439891f13f1de635b7"}, "id": "po76c4ssrbs51"}}, "name": "t3_j8rmcm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/P7pq7LOMhYoyATFyY7IVv9YUfpZSHG9eyXNu5m4RDEA.jpg", "edited": 1602365623.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1602361549.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/po76c4ssrbs51.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=987acdb3b31822b63b5f66439891f13f1de635b7\"&gt;Fancy seems to \\&amp;quot;adjust\\&amp;quot;

Make sure to find the J curve map that has the railroad tracks forming the J.  Look at the pictures.  Bottom right, the tunnel.  This is just past the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those passes are great when you&amp;#39;re afraid to move too much, but need to keep from blanking out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest you run along the beach the instant you fall to it, to encourage the double to help you out like that more often.  He likes activity, and also &amp;quot;projects&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you take off running the instant you hit the beach, it&amp;#39;ll help stabilize that phantom world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double likes &amp;quot;projects&amp;quot; so much, the last day or two mine is wearing binoculars around his neck, hanging from a strap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A witch threw it into my dark room from more than 6000 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He liked them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/v50fat/is_there_any_specific_way_you_should_do_the_dark/ib97ye9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1654439529.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_v50fat", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ib7cus7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1654391352.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ib75iye", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "A few.

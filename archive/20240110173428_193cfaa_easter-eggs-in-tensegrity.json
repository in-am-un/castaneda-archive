The location where you practice can alter the results, once you can perceive the magic Tensegrity produces.\n\nCarlos even had a \"naked not-doings\" class for women only. He said it was his \"last chance\", or something equivalent to it. He was dying, and so far had failed to teach sorcery to even a single person.\n\nAs he told me in private, \"I'm dying, and no one believes me.\"\n\nSo he resorted to more extreme measures. To exploiting sexual embarrassment more like the way the lineages used it. Typically when reading the books people noticed if Genaro told Carlos his fly was down and his penis was visible. Genaro was using the same technique.\n\nEmbarrassment to move the assemblage point.\n\nBut the books were censored for most other \"shenanigans\" of the lineages.\n\nFor Carlos, naked tensegrity classes made no difference. He still died, with everyone clueless.\n\nBeing naked and embarrassed like that, while doing those not-doing series techniques, is twice as likely to lure the double of those women to come closer.\n\nWhich of course is the whole point of Tensegrity. To produce the \"energy body\". AKA \"The Double\".\n\nJust keep in mind, some variety in how, when, and where to do your tensegrity, can be useful.\n\nYou should also be aware, some magical sights during tensegrity are caused by your energy body forming around your torso. That includes inorganic being visitors, puffs of purple, and even your double giving you a third arm while you are focusing on a difficult hand movement.\n\nIt's easy to get confused and believe that's the \"real magic\" of Tensegrity. When in fact, that's just a side effect.\n\n\"Silent Knowledge\" is when things actually get interesting.\n\nThat is not the energy body. Nor is it an inorganic being assistant.\n\nIt's \"things\" which exist by themselves, forever. As a result of past activity in Man's band of emanations.\n\nAnd the tensegrity movements can become the \"topic selector\" for Silent Knowledge. To summon a \"bundle\" of emanations from the dark sea of awareness, to make it visible to you.\n\nI was very surprised a half hour ago to see this \"easter egg\" hidden in the recapitulation series. I had no idea!\n\nAnd while gazing at it and realizing why that sorcery pass was causing it, I also realized it was \"inevitable\" to be able to perceive this in Silent Knowledge.\n\nPartly I discovered it because I didn't practice long enough last night, and wanted to finish my series of forms in the dark warehouse at work. So maybe infinity rewarded me for that.\n\nThe change in locations triggered a change in the results.\n\nLater, walking around my business park gazing down at the asphalt, the purple puffs decided to tag along.\n\nIn full sunlight.\n\nSo when you hear a crazy story about Carlos or Carol Tiggs seeing inorganic beings moving along a sidewalk near people who couldn't perceive them, you'll get an idea what it's like to be in Silent Knowledge all the time.\n\nAnd maybe realize, they aren't making up stuff at all.\n\nOne has to admire them when they relate those stories at workshops.\n\nThere's a \"force\" out there which tries to suppress that kind of talk.\n\nYou can feel it, the moment you start a story like that when speaking to non-sorcerers.\n\nYou broke a rule which you never agreed to follow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Easter Eggs in Tensegrity", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"m1j6dks74nbc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1j6dks74nbc1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9abfec02da563866a080078696410aae999909a"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1j6dks74nbc1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2520b7e48b6606836a6b8e8d295efad17891773"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1j6dks74nbc1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5800dcb369993e640f21f3414a3ef4d17833bca3"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1j6dks74nbc1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=706d3d3fdb6375478953265310233a4129328d26"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1j6dks74nbc1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0efeaf876451d3ea911e8230ad5a26497a6f3af"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1j6dks74nbc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6709ff89ccb9ccfc3d6d09f976b79ee897f7033"}], "s": {"y": 2350, "x": 2350, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m1j6dks74nbc1.jpg?width=2350&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27d836d4e6aeb4d38aa8d3d7b8e64a1e7e6a52a3"}, "id": "m1j6dks74nbc1"}}, "name": "t3_193cfaa", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 30, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 30, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gGotVjytQBeYNlL3kIO3N-tx03B5BN6Aqo6f-l9XmSI.jpg", "edited": 1704912013.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1704904468.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;![img](m1j6dks74nbc1 &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a good idea to do your tensegrity in more than one place.

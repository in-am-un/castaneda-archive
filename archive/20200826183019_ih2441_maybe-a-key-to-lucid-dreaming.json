I had to go up a ladder and down multiple times a day. Another example is waking up every morning to do Physical fitness (Army job)... So when repetition (specially a new activity) comes into my life, I have experience that at night I will have a sequence of images while \"dreaming\"that is related to the job I am doing at the time. The curious thing is that this dreams are not pleasant... using the same examples is like... Army: I will dream that I was late for formation, or that I was in vacation and the flight got cancel, etc.  \nWhy is it important to mention that the dream is not pleasant? because it is the same feeling I had before when I am in my room (dreaming) and i feel someone is in the other side of the door. I notice this similar feeling this past weekend after working with nail, hammer, and wood all day when I \"felt asleep\".   \nOn that night I went to sleep with the idea of trying to do Lucid Dreaming, so I started the same procedures I take..... then... BANGGGG I am in the dream but not fully LUCID, I was dreaming the I was in the ladder like earlier that day, and I felt the same sensation... this time the feeling is not of someone behind the door, but the feeling I am about to fall. What I do.... force myself to wake up because I got scare.... THEN...  \n\n\nI came to realization and the purpose of this post... how about if I force to think of actually falling from the ladder. I started doing it. At the point that when I was asleep dreaming, I was not scare anymore, I was joyful just jumping of the building or ladder.

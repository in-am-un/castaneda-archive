The magic of the Jedi is based on our own.\n\n\"Potential Omnipotence\" is our normal state.  See this passage on an incident with a Leopard from the books:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"The greatest difference between an average man and a sorcerer is that a sorcerer commands  his death with his speed,\" don Juan went on. \"If it comes to that, the jaguar will not eat me.  He'll eat you, because you don't have the speed to hold back your death.\"\n\n...\n\nBut while he was talking, thoughts and unanchored memories about other perceivable universes  were forming in my mind, as if on a screen. I told don Juan I was thinking strange thoughts.\n\nHe laughed and recommended I stick to the  jaguar, because he was so real that he could only be a true manifestation of the spirit.\n\nThe idea of how real the animal was made me shudder. \"Wouldn't it be better if we changed direction instead of heading straight for the hills?\" I  asked.\n\n...\n\n\"Another maneuver silent knowledge might dictate would be to kick up dirt,\" don Juan said. He looked at me for an instant as if he were waiting for my reactions. \"We are going to walk very calmly now,\" he said. \"And you are going to kick up dirt as if you  were a ten-foot giant.\"\n\nI must have had a stupid expression on my face. Don Juan's body shook with laughter. \"Raise a cloud of dust with your feet,\" he ordered me. \"Feel huge and heavy.\" I tried it and immediately had a sense of massiveness.\n\nIn a joking tone, I commented that his  power of suggestion was incredible. I actually felt gigantic and ferocious. He assured me that  my feeling of size was not in any way the product of his suggestion, but the product of a shift of my assemblage point. He said that men of antiquity became legendary because they knew by silent knowledge about  the power to be obtained by moving the assemblage point.\n\n...\n\n\"Be gigantic!\" he ordered me, smiling. \"Do away with reason.\"\n\nThen I knew exactly what he meant. In fact, I knew that I could increase the intensity of my  feelings of size and ferociousness until I actually could be a giant, hovering over the shrubs,  seeing all around us. I tried to voice my thoughts but quickly gave up. I became aware that don Juan knew all I was  thinking, and obviously much, much more. And then something extraordinary happened to me. My reasoning faculties ceased to function. Literally I felt as though a dark blanket had covered me and obscured my thoughts.\n\nI let go of  my reason with the abandon of one who doesn't have a worry in the world. I was convinced  that if I wanted to dispel the obscuring blanket, all I had to do was feel myself breaking  through it.\n\nIn that state, I felt I was being propelled; set in motion. Something was making me move  physically from one place to another. I did not experience any fatigue. The speed and ease with which I could move elated me. I did not feel I was walking; I was not flying either. Rather I was being transported with  extreme facility. My movements became jerky and ungraceful only when I tried to think about  them. When I enjoyed them without thought, I entered into a unique state of physical elation  for which I had no precedent. If I had had instances of that kind of physical happiness in my life, they must have been so  short-lived that they had left no memory. Yet when I experienced that ecstasy I felt a vague  recognition, as if I had once known it but had forgotten.\n\nThe exhilaration of moving through the chaparral was so intense that everything else ceased.  The only things that existed for me were those periods of exhilaration and the moments when I would stop moving and find myself facing the chaparral. But even more inexplicable was the total bodily sensation of looming over the bushes which I  had had since the instant I started to move.\n\nAt one moment, I clearly saw the figure of the jaguar up ahead of me. He was running away as  fast as he could. I felt that he was trying to avoid the spines of the cactuses. He was being  extremely careful about where he stepped.\n\nI had the overwhelming urge to run after the jaguar and scare him into losing his caution. I  knew that he would get pricked by the spines. A thought then erupted in my silent mind- I  thought that the jaguar would be a more dangerous animal if he was hurt by the spines. That  thought produced the same effect as someone waking me from a dream. When I became aware that my thinking processes were functioning again, I found that I was at the base of a low range of rocky hills. I looked around. Don Juan was a few feet away. He  seemed exhausted. He was pale and breathing very hard.\n\n\"What happened, don Juan?\" I asked, after clearing my raspy throat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe left that perhaps 10,000 years ago or longer, in favor of \"reason\".\n\nSo instead of \"the voice of seeing\" telling us what's what, we ended up with that nagging internal dialogue in our mind.\n\nI guess you get one voice or the other.\n\nBut that nagging internal dialogue is all about censorship, and blocking what's not allowed to exist when your assemblage point is in the location where reason prevails.  Or about pursuing attention from other humans.\n\nSo it might seem unusual for dreams to see the future, but it's really not that big of a deal.\n\nAnd focusing on it won't get you anywhere.\n\nYOU want to be able to do that.\n\nBut in your dreams, it's just your double. The other you.\n\nHe does a lot cooler things than that.\n\nI'd guess this gives you an obstacle to overcome that others don't have, if you actually want to learn real magic.\n\nYou might convince yourself you already have some, and so why work to learn a different kind?\n\nExcept...\n\nLook around in here.\n\nThe magic being done in here kicks the butt of every other magical system or religion, hands down.\n\nAnd uncontrolled precog is a part of all of those.\n\nSince it's a natural human ability even if not developed on purpose.", "edited": 1692706128.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jx9eudx", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything man has ever known, does now know, and will in the future know, is available to humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like with Yoda!

I told don Juan I was thinking strange thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He laughed and recommended I stick to the  jaguar, because he was so real that he could only be a true manifestation of the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea of how real the animal was made me shudder. &amp;quot;Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be better if we changed direction instead of heading straight for the hills?&amp;quot; I  asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Another maneuver silent knowledge might dictate would be to kick up dirt,&amp;quot; don Juan said. He looked at me for an instant as if he were waiting for my reactions. &amp;quot;We are going to walk very calmly now,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;And you are going to kick up dirt as if you  were a ten-foot giant.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must have had a stupid expression on my face. Don Juan&amp;#39;s body shook with laughter. &amp;quot;Raise a cloud of dust with your feet,&amp;quot; he ordered me. &amp;quot;Feel huge and heavy.&amp;quot; I tried it and immediately had a sense of massiveness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a joking tone, I commented that his  power of suggestion was incredible. I actually felt gigantic and ferocious. He assured me that  my feeling of size was not in any way the product of his suggestion, but the product of a shift of my assemblage point. He said that men of antiquity became legendary because they knew by silent knowledge about  the power to be obtained by moving the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Be gigantic!&amp;quot; he ordered me, smiling. &amp;quot;Do away with reason.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I knew exactly what he meant. In fact, I knew that I could increase the intensity of my  feelings of size and ferociousness until I actually could be a giant, hovering over the shrubs,  seeing all around us. I tried to voice my thoughts but quickly gave up. I became aware that don Juan knew all I was  thinking, and obviously much, much more. And then something extraordinary happened to me. My reasoning faculties ceased to function. Literally I felt as though a dark blanket had covered me and obscured my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I let go of  my reason with the abandon of one who doesn&amp;#39;t have a worry in the world. I was convinced  that if I wanted to dispel the obscuring blanket, all I had to do was feel myself breaking  through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that state, I felt I was being propelled; set in motion. Something was making me move  physically from one place to another. I did not experience any fatigue. The speed and ease with which I could move elated me. I did not feel I was walking; I was not flying either. Rather I was being transported with  extreme facility. My movements became jerky and ungraceful only when I tried to think about  them. When I enjoyed them without thought, I entered into a unique state of physical elation  for which I had no precedent. If I had had instances of that kind of physical happiness in my life, they must have been so  short-lived that they had left no memory. Yet when I experienced that ecstasy I felt a vague  recognition, as if I had once known it but had forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The exhilaration of moving through the chaparral was so intense that everything else ceased.  The only things that existed for me were those periods of exhilaration and the moments when I would stop moving and find myself facing the chaparral. But even more inexplicable was the total bodily sensation of looming over the bushes which I  had had since the instant I started to move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one moment, I clearly saw the figure of the jaguar up ahead of me. He was running away as  fast as he could. I felt that he was trying to avoid the spines of the cactuses. He was being  extremely careful about where he stepped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the overwhelming urge to run after the jaguar and scare him into losing his caution. I  knew that he would get pricked by the spines. A thought then erupted in my silent mind- I  thought that the jaguar would be a more dangerous animal if he was hurt by the spines. That  thought produced the same effect as someone waking me from a dream. When I became aware that my thinking processes were functioning again, I found that I was at the base of a low range of rocky hills. I looked around. Don Juan was a few feet away. He  seemed exhausted. He was pale and breathing very hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What happened, don Juan?&amp;quot; I asked, after clearing my raspy throat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We left that perhaps 10,000 years ago or longer, in favor of &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So instead of &amp;quot;the voice of seeing&amp;quot; telling us what&amp;#39;s what, we ended up with that nagging internal dialogue in our mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess you get one voice or the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that nagging internal dialogue is all about censorship, and blocking what&amp;#39;s not allowed to exist when your assemblage point is in the location where reason prevails.  Or about pursuing attention from other humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it might seem unusual for dreams to see the future, but it&amp;#39;s really not that big of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And focusing on it won&amp;#39;t get you anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YOU want to be able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in your dreams, it&amp;#39;s just your double. The other you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He does a lot cooler things than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d guess this gives you an obstacle to overcome that others don&amp;#39;t have, if you actually want to learn real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might convince yourself you already have some, and so why work to learn a different kind?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look around in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The magic being done in here kicks the butt of every other magical system or religion, hands down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And uncontrolled precog is a part of all of those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;#39;s a natural human ability even if not developed on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/15xtl6b/precognitive_dreams/jx9eudx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1692705871.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_15xtl6b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jxhyctk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "EnthusiasmOk1060", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1692841629.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jx9a7ou", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_i3f2jqo98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Ive been reading this and other posts since I found out this place its huge.

And there&amp;#39;s a picture of 3 fish, just so bizarre...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had several bigger ones too, one I knew a woman&amp;#39;s name without ever meeting her. I&amp;#39;ve been warned of an event that would harm me, and it happened to the exact! I have crazy intuition. Once I came home and saw my backdoor was open. I closed it but I knew...I just KNEW there was a bird in my house. I walked all over searching for a bird before I realized I was probably just crazy. 2 hours later I heard a little chirp. There was a little tiny blue Jay hanging out in one of my plants. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what it means but it&amp;#39;s special. The dream world is not nothing. It is very much tied to this world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/15xtl6b/precognitive_dreams/jx8drzp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1692679134.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_15xtl6b", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

But when I try to write the title and explanation part of my picture, I can't.\n\nSo I \"recycled\" the most appropriate one, and showed where on that path it's talking about.\n\nThere's too much \"misunderstanding\" to undo in a short paragraph at the top of a picture, and without that there's no \"purpose\" to the picture.\n\nI suppose I'll just explain this in pieces.\n\nWhen it's appropriate.\n\nSo it started, because getting to Silent Knowledge mode requires moving your assemblage point that last few inches, where the J curve bends to go to the right side of your stomach.\n\nI never included that in the pics, because it seemed impossible anyone would get that far.  So I just took the last part of the explanation Carlos gave us, and made it purple.  And just continued the \"J\" shape.\n\nI suppose I was too interested in the shape, and didn't want a \"fancy J\" with some extra lines going the wrong way on the short end of the J, like a weird  font.\n\nBut in fact, Silent Knowledge does not show up in full force until you get your assemblage point directly over the second attention's assemblage point.\n\nWhich is located 4 inches to the right of center, somewhere around the middle of your belly.\n\nIt's where we wiggle the fingers to \"dent\" it.\n\nBy the way, when you get advanced you begin to realize that the \"blue ball of light\" form of the energy body is actually more likely what you are \"building\" with the \"redeployed energy\" that Tensegrity manipulates.\n\nYou scoop the puffs, and place them where they stick.\n\nThey don't stick to your elbow.\n\nYou can't wear them as a hat (for very long).\n\nBut you can place them right next to the awareness \"trapped\" in your organic form, in major \"organ groups\".\n\nEach \"energy pouch\" on the body (3 total plus \"V spot\"), is actually 2 organs.\n\nThose are living beings!\n\nWe're sort of a \"colony\" of internal organs which help each other out.\n\nAnd so our energy of awareness has gotten trapped in those.\n\nIt's \"concentrated\" in those places.\n\nThe puffs of purple are awareness energy that didn't join in. It just floated around inside our egg.\n\nOne theory says, all of it was free when we were created but we \"noticed\" this world.  We assembled some of it, from the emanations.  They got skimmed, and we \"liked the look\".\n\nPart of us said, \"I want to learn more!\"\n\nAnd it forgot what it really was.\n\nThe other half was like the bad boy older brother. He went off to play with matches, while his stupid little brother went to hang out with the mormons who came to ring his doorbell.\n\nThe Mormon portion of our energy got \"trapped\".  It \"took a birth\".\n\nSo we ended up 2 beings inside one egg, each with independent consciousness.\n\nBut the situation is more complicated than that.\n\nLet's call the trapped awareness, \"Tonal Awareness\".\n\nAnd the free awareness (the purple puffs), \"Double Awareness\".\n\nTensegrity is designed to \"play with\" both kinds of awareness, so as to make the \"Double awareness\" useful to the \"Tonal Awareness\".\n\nNow's where I have to give beginners an unpleasant lecture.\n\nALL OF MAGIC has been destroyed.  Removed from the world.\n\nMoney caused it.\n\nBut no need to go into that.  As a result, every single discussion group out there with a topic of magic,  which includes Buddhism and such things, is a total fraud.\n\nAll the people in there are only trying to boost their self image.\n\nThey're entirely absorbed into self-pity.\n\nSome get weird stuff to happen by messing with the internal dialogue.\n\nMeditation for example,\n\nBut it's not a \"path\" that leads anywhere.  They give you the technique to make you feel some bliss and see a few crummy visionts, then lie their pants off on what it all means.\n\nTo get your money.\n\nAs a result everyone fully expects to be able to lie also. When discussing experiences.\n\nIt's literally a river of shit out there!  Everyone pissing on each other.  If you complain, they poop on you.\n\nIf that sounds a little harsh, it's not.  It's really a description of the flow of awareness, on the blue line.\n\nThe blue line is our normal assemblage point position.\n\nTo keep it fixed there, to make \"causality\" real, requires tieing up all of your awareness so none of it focuses on a lower position of the assemblage point.    In fact we can see down to the green line even from the blue line on the J curve.  But our awareness is completely tied to the blue by thousands of small strings. Our \"internal dialogue\".  It flows from one \"tie\" to another, all in the blue line zone's way of viewing the world. From worry to worry.\n\nThe \"River of Shit\" is really about your own consciousness.  The pissing and pooping on each other all day long, is just a humorous (but accurate) way to describe how beings totally imprisoned to their internal dialogue, interact with each other.\n\nOnce you learn to move your assemblage point at least midway between green and red, all this starts to become more obvious.\n\nYou become truly interested in getting more magic, instead of in pacifying that internal dialogue of yours, with some pretend magic.\n\nSo everywhere else you go to discuss magic, it's ok to make up stuff.\n\nBut not in here.\n\nYou make up stuff in here, and your reputation goes to shit, and no one trusts you enough to want to help you.\n\nIf you want to see this yourself, watch the new people flow into the subreddit and claim to have done \"this thing\". Or \"I did that thing\" from the picture posts.\n\nThey enter, lieing!\n\nYou might think, \"They're just confused.  They don't realize what they claim to have done, is not the same thing.\"\n\nI don't agree. They lie to get attention.  What they are confused about is actually believing it's ok to lie, because it's all pretend anyway.\n\nIt's not!  And people who have worked hard and moved their assemblage points are completely different than people still stuck trying to pretend, to get attention for themselves.\n\nTrying to \"convert\" a person from pretending to real, usually results in someone's head exploding.\n\nBut many just stick around anyway.  Which means if they continue to want to comment they harm others.\n\nSo please, don't pretend.\n\nI say that because I'm about to explain some things that beginners will try to pretend, to get more attention.\n\nCarlos tried to avoid that.\n\nSo he explained as little as possible and just gave \"techniques\" and \"orders\".\n\n\"DO THESE PASSES 3 TIMES EACH, ONE AFTER THE OTHER\".  That's the \"orders\" that go with the \"Mashing Energy for Intent\" series of passes.\n\nHe gave us a little \"story\" to go with each set of passes, but it was far from a detailed explanation.\n\nAll I can say about that series of passes is, \"It's a goddamn miracle!!!\"\n\nThose truly are.  If you could see those in Silent Knowledge it would become clear.\n\nTensegrity is \"An Abyss\".\n\nBut it doesn't work much if you can't get rid of the internal dialogue, so that the movements can pull you off the edge.\n\nSo they can move the assemblage point.\n\nEach set is potentially \"micro designed\" to produce a specific finished position.\n\nOr perhaps more accurately, to move the assemblage point along a path that \"teaches you skills\".\n\nUnfortunately, without the ability to *see* you can't notice the skills you gain.\n\nSo the question comes up, did Carlos not give us \"enough\" instructions and explanations?\n\nWas he \"too cautious\" to avoid giving out stuff beginners could pretend to get attention, and thus turn our sorcery discussions and workshops into the same sort of pretending you find in other magical system discussion groups?\n\nIt's  a REAL BATTLE in here to keep people from turning this into a \"Pretend A Thon\".\n\nIt's painful to fight the bad players day in and day out.\n\nI have an unknown number all of a sudden hooking on to my Facebook, to try to turn it into that.\n\nBut this place would be destroyed in no time if it catered to self-pity the way other groups do.\n\nI suppose the answer to whether Carlos ought to have given more details is no.\n\nBut... He died too soon.\n\nMy strategy has been to \"seduce\" everyone into following his instructions.\n\nBy explaining the reward.\n\nSo I risk stirring up pretenders.\n\nOr even creating some \"blocks\" for the sincere people, who get so far along the J curve that reality starts to change.\n\nOur mistaken understandings become burdens as the assemblage point moves.\n\nThey manifest as solid, visible objects.  Which trap attention.\n\nThey create \"phantom realities\", even if they are \"tiny\" ones.\n\nAnd those trap you.\n\nSo my warning is over.\n\nHere's a \"rethink\" of what happens when you do Tensegrity.\n\nThe double is perhaps more properly called, \"the energy body\".\n\nThe energy body most likely DOES NOT EXIST, until you make one.\n\nAny sort of body could be made instead.\n\nBut the easiest \"body\" is created by concentrating his energy of awareness.\n\n\"The Art of Dreaming\" goes a different route.  You go in to dreams, and \"pull out\" a very specific form of the energy body.  The double.\n\nBut darkroom \"builds\" from scratch.\n\nThe energy needed has been pushed to the outside by daily living.\n\nTensegrity stirs it up.    Tensegrity is \"hopeful\".  And it's physical, so it helps reduce the internal dialogue.\n\nThe Tonal Awareness \"flows\" with the tensegrity, and that \"pulls\" on the Double awareness.\n\nIt seems that the double awareness is attracted to the tonal awareness. Perhaps the combination wants to return to being able to function as a whole.\n\nDoesn't have to.  But likes to.\n\nSo the tensegrity gets the double awareness flowing, and it tends to concentrate into puffs.  The double awareness is also attracted to itself.\n\nWe \"scoop\" it onto the tonal awareness, at the most concentrated points.\n\nAnd it tends to \"stick\" there.\n\nYou can visibly see it! In fact, eventually it becomes \"intense\".\n\nAs it collects on the torso it also becomes attracted to itself as a whole, and you end up with a blob of purple awareness lingering on  your torso.\n\nThat's the \"blue ball of energy\" form.  It could simply \"leave you\" at that point, and if it held together you could do the trick Genaro did, when he showed his blue ball form to Carlos.\n\nThat awareness is capable of being turned into anything.   Its \"ripe\" with dreaming attention. In fact, any dream you have is likely just from that form of awareness.\n\nI'm not convinced the tonal awareness can dream at all.  We'll have to see.  I think, the fast visions you get at the green zone are from the double awareness joining in with the tonal, and \"helping it see dreams\".\n\nThe \"bliss\" comes because the body lets up on the constant obsession with the blue zone river of shit.  The body gets to \"relax stuff\" in ways we couldn't describe, and bliss is the result.\n\nBecause what happens in the green zone seems like something other than it really is, that we have gotten the double awareness to merge with us a bit,  we don't have a very good understanding of how J curving really works.\n\nLet's skip to a \"practical experiment\" you can try.  I'll have to skip a lot of \"sights\" along the way, which would help to explain this, but become problems for beginners, who will pretend these things, because they are not just \"following orders\" as Carlos had in mind.\n\nWork hard, never neglecting the tensegrity. It's actually the key to all this.  Internal silence is needed to \"let the tensegrity work\", but is NOT the cause.\n\nLater you will realize, the internal dialogue is nothing. Not even important.\n\nWhat's important is \"focusing the attention\".  And not allowing it to focus anywhere, but where you want it to focus.\n\nThe internal dialogue is merely designed to cause it to focus on 10,000 small things, up at the blue line on the J curve.  To keep you trapped there.\n\nBut once you learn to focus ALL of your attention, EXACTLY where you want it to focus, the internal dialogue is no longer a big issue.\n\nUntil the \"very end\" of the J curve.  But that's another story.  Behind the internal dialogue is the \"motivation\" for it.  Or \"motivations\".  I'm not sure which.\n\nIt's that which obsesses the internal dialogue.\n\nSo J curving first removes the internal dialogue as much as possible so the tensegrity can free up some of the double's awareness, which comes to combine with the tonal awareness  and allows you to \"notice\" things coming from deeper levels of the assemblage point.\n\nBut past the start of the orange zone you learn to focus your awareness instead, and the internal dialogue isn't as big of a deal.\n\nUntil the end where your \"motivation\" becomes a huge issue.\n\nBecause \"motivation\" screws up Silent Knowledge. It's a \"selector\".\n\nThat brings us to the whitish light.  Where you can test these theories out.\n\nSitting on pillows in perfect darkness, with the whitish light very visible on all surfaces,  relax and watch the wall until you see some \"texture\".\n\nWe need to \"prove\" your whitish light.  To eliminate imagining.\n\nIf you can force more silence until the whitish light has texture which starts to have \"details\" of a phantom room, you are good to go.  \n\nJust gaze into the whitish light not trying to \"make it become anything\", and lift one of your hands.\n\nDo you see a \"dark echo\"?\n\nThen you're in business.\n\nThat's the double's hand.\n\nMove it around, try the other hand, until you are \"certain\" that's not just some visual effect of the eyes.  Perfect darkness is mandatory for this experiment.\n\nNow, make your double's hands \"flow\" until you actually start to see dark arms.\n\nOr \"glass arms\" or hands, if you are very far along.\n\nI'm not sure what happens if you get the \"real arms\".  Your arms, dressed in your sunday \"going to church\" finest.\n\nAll of those \"views\" of the double are possible.\n\nIf you start to get \"purple puff\" hands, you skipped to the end of this technique.  \n\nShame on you!\n\nMove the double's arms in a flowing motion, outwards at the bottom, then back up in a circle towards your shoulders, and down again.  \"Stir\" the whitish light while scooping it up.\n\nThe whitish light will transform into purple and red, with jet black.\n\nYou just \"converted\" the whitish light back to a sight more suitable for the red zone.\n\nBut what \"really\" happened is, you got the double to \"come out from inside you\", and go back into the room.  Still clinging closely to the tonal awareness of your physical body.\n\nDrop the hands, keep forcing silence, until the air \"clears\" and the whitish light is back.\n\nNotice the \"shine\" in the whitish light.\n\nIt's like tiny patches inside the whitish light, which are somewhat \"charged\".\n\nI suppose, the quantity of those could be described as being the same as dark asphalt, the normal kind with little pebbles glued together by tar, which has of \"shiny\" pebbles.  The slightly lighter bits of the pebbles, if you move your head around. It's the \"highlights\" that make it possible to still seen the individual pebbles in the asphalt.\n\nThere's an extra \"shine\" in the whitish light, if you look for it.\n\nIt's the double awareness.\n\nThe combination of the tonal awareness and the double awareness makes the whitish light.\n\nYou can cause it to form \"phantom rooms\" specifically because it contains the double awareness.\n\nThat's dreaming awareness.\n\nBut you can \"separate\" them.\n\nThis next experiment requires you to not pay attention to whether your eyes are open or closed.\n\nNow that I said that I \"spoiled it\".  So ignore it.\n\nBut just don't be interested in \"forcing them to stay open\", when you try this.\n\nLet them do what they want, but don't \"make them\" do anything in particular.\n\nSitting very still gaze at the whitish light, and notice it extends \"inside\" your physical body.\n\nThe whitish light is somewhat like \"dream fog\".  It's easy to \"focus it\" on your walls, or flat surfaces.\n\nBut it also creates the \"second attention fog\".  The \"crystalline dreaming fog\" is merely you focusing to create mini \"surfaces\" which reveal dream objects in the air.\n\nAnd it can be \"focused\" inside your torso as a \"flat screen of whitish light\", around the same size as your torso.\n\nLike a \"panel\" implanted in the center of the tonal awareness.\n\nA \"panel of dreaming attention\".\n\nIt's the double awareness.\n\nNow find the \"shiny\" bits and pieces on that panel.\n\nGently focus on noticing those, and then do your best to ignore them, by forcing all of the remaining traces of the internal dialogue out.\n\nAt this point, you won't have a talking voice.  Your attention is too well focused on that \"panel\" inside you.\n\nBut your \"motivations\" are still not \"removed\".\n\nForce silence so well you forget where you are, who you are, or any \"expectations\" you might have, for what you are doing.\n\nTwo things can happen.  We aren't trying to get one or the other to occur, but to notice there are \"2 directions\".\n\nIf you \"go\" one direction, you will find yourself standing in a dream. Or flying in it, driving inside a car, even falling off a cliff.\n\nIt's  a dream.  And it has absorbed you for an instant.  You even lose lucidity.\n\nBut you'll \"bounce out\" and back onto the pillows.  Normally people ignore this sort of thing, but you need to notice it.\n\nBy removing your \"motivation\", you sent the double elsewhere.  In this case, he went into his endless phantom realms.\n\nBut you can also \"retain trace motivations\".  Good ones.  To \"work with the double\" inside the darkroom.\n\nIn that case, a vision of a little dream will materialize in the darkness in front of you.  Instead of \"going inward\", it will \"come out into the room\".\n\nThe dreaming awareness won't into its phantom realm.\n\nIt'll obey your desire to merge with your tonal awareness, and produce a little dream vision in the air.\n\nThose can be quite vivid!  That's what you see on the cover of Wheel of time, with those phases of the moon in the sky.\n\nIn order to reach \"full on\" silent knowledge, you have to produce those dream bubbles.\n\nIt's on that diagram I made.\n\nBut you still need 1 more thing.  \"Objects\".\n\nThat's a different \"level of interaction\" of the double.\n\nA \"place\" or a small phantom dream view in the air, is not the same as an \"object\" which can be used to \"do something\".\n\nBoth are needed for full on Silent Knowledge exploration.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Stirring the Whitish Light", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Games"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"f6sh93l9iqr81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f6sh93l9iqr81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=104c1d9b17068bbfe876f61517ac512e5f732a12"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f6sh93l9iqr81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1ed46789b8ddec34b310613840d13089554edf1"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f6sh93l9iqr81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc50a7ef9dfd6f76911db6fcd88be0318c39059d"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f6sh93l9iqr81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b2d8158d062e8784a55cd1c5f761de5f036953c"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f6sh93l9iqr81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8986071e3661b76a9794bfe02bee92342d348ec2"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f6sh93l9iqr81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e393455c3f17533d71b2f6dddfda36e8792eb099"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/f6sh93l9iqr81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f2b9ab6b19412d83ceb992b1c192bb215a45dda"}, "id": "f6sh93l9iqr81"}}, "name": "t3_twxvbr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Games", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/zX6jJQpdxExteqOUPUClDaAuC1LLy0vtun2w7CUj5Gw.jpg", "edited": 1649177453.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1649173385.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/f6sh93l9iqr81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2f2b9ab6b19412d83ceb992b1c192bb215a45dda\"&gt;There more going on than we \\&amp;quot;expect\\&amp;quot;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This really needs a picture.  But when I try to write the title and explanation part of my picture, I can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I &amp;quot;recycled&amp;quot; the most appropriate one, and showed where on that path it&amp;#39;s talking about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s too much &amp;quot;misunderstanding&amp;quot; to undo in a short paragraph at the top of a picture, and without that there&amp;#39;s no &amp;quot;purpose&amp;quot; to the picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose I&amp;#39;ll just explain this in pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it started, because getting to Silent Knowledge mode requires moving your assemblage point that last few inches, where the J curve bends to go to the right side of your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never included that in the pics, because it seemed impossible anyone would get that far.  So I just took the last part of the explanation Carlos gave us, and made it purple.  And just continued the &amp;quot;J&amp;quot; shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose I was too interested in the shape, and didn&amp;#39;t want a &amp;quot;fancy J&amp;quot; with some extra lines going the wrong way on the short end of the J, like a weird  font.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, Silent Knowledge does not show up in full force until you get your assemblage point directly over the second attention&amp;#39;s assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is located 4 inches to the right of center, somewhere around the middle of your belly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s where we wiggle the fingers to &amp;quot;dent&amp;quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, when you get advanced you begin to realize that the &amp;quot;blue ball of light&amp;quot; form of the energy body is actually more likely what you are &amp;quot;building&amp;quot; with the &amp;quot;redeployed energy&amp;quot; that Tensegrity manipulates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You scoop the puffs, and place them where they stick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t stick to your elbow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t wear them as a hat (for very long).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can place them right next to the awareness &amp;quot;trapped&amp;quot; in your organic form, in major &amp;quot;organ groups&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each &amp;quot;energy pouch&amp;quot; on the body (3 total plus &amp;quot;V spot&amp;quot;), is actually 2 organs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are living beings!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re sort of a &amp;quot;colony&amp;quot; of internal organs which help each other out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so our energy of awareness has gotten trapped in those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;concentrated&amp;quot; in those places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The puffs of purple are awareness energy that didn&amp;#39;t join in. It just floated around inside our egg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One theory says, all of it was free when we were created but we &amp;quot;noticed&amp;quot; this world.  We assembled some of it, from the emanations.  They got skimmed, and we &amp;quot;liked the look&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of us said, &amp;quot;I want to learn more!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it forgot what it really was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other half was like the bad boy older brother. He went off to play with matches, while his stupid little brother went to hang out with the mormons who came to ring his doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Mormon portion of our energy got &amp;quot;trapped&amp;quot;.  It &amp;quot;took a birth&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we ended up 2 beings inside one egg, each with independent consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the situation is more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s call the trapped awareness, &amp;quot;Tonal Awareness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the free awareness (the purple puffs), &amp;quot;Double Awareness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity is designed to &amp;quot;play with&amp;quot; both kinds of awareness, so as to make the &amp;quot;Double awareness&amp;quot; useful to the &amp;quot;Tonal Awareness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now&amp;#39;s where I have to give beginners an unpleasant lecture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ALL OF MAGIC has been destroyed.  Removed from the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Money caused it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no need to go into that.  As a result, every single discussion group out there with a topic of magic,  which includes Buddhism and such things, is a total fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the people in there are only trying to boost their self image.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re entirely absorbed into self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some get weird stuff to happen by messing with the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meditation for example,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not a &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; that leads anywhere.  They give you the technique to make you feel some bliss and see a few crummy visionts, then lie their pants off on what it all means.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get your money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result everyone fully expects to be able to lie also. When discussing experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s literally a river of shit out there!  Everyone pissing on each other.  If you complain, they poop on you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that sounds a little harsh, it&amp;#39;s not.  It&amp;#39;s really a description of the flow of awareness, on the blue line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The blue line is our normal assemblage point position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To keep it fixed there, to make &amp;quot;causality&amp;quot; real, requires tieing up all of your awareness so none of it focuses on a lower position of the assemblage point.    In fact we can see down to the green line even from the blue line on the J curve.  But our awareness is completely tied to the blue by thousands of small strings. Our &amp;quot;internal dialogue&amp;quot;.  It flows from one &amp;quot;tie&amp;quot; to another, all in the blue line zone&amp;#39;s way of viewing the world. From worry to worry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;River of Shit&amp;quot; is really about your own consciousness.  The pissing and pooping on each other all day long, is just a humorous (but accurate) way to describe how beings totally imprisoned to their internal dialogue, interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you learn to move your assemblage point at least midway between green and red, all this starts to become more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You become truly interested in getting more magic, instead of in pacifying that internal dialogue of yours, with some pretend magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So everywhere else you go to discuss magic, it&amp;#39;s ok to make up stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You make up stuff in here, and your reputation goes to shit, and no one trusts you enough to want to help you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to see this yourself, watch the new people flow into the subreddit and claim to have done &amp;quot;this thing&amp;quot;. Or &amp;quot;I did that thing&amp;quot; from the picture posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They enter, lieing!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might think, &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re just confused.  They don&amp;#39;t realize what they claim to have done, is not the same thing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t agree. They lie to get attention.  What they are confused about is actually believing it&amp;#39;s ok to lie, because it&amp;#39;s all pretend anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not!  And people who have worked hard and moved their assemblage points are completely different than people still stuck trying to pretend, to get attention for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to &amp;quot;convert&amp;quot; a person from pretending to real, usually results in someone&amp;#39;s head exploding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But many just stick around anyway.  Which means if they continue to want to comment they harm others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So please, don&amp;#39;t pretend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say that because I&amp;#39;m about to explain some things that beginners will try to pretend, to get more attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos tried to avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he explained as little as possible and just gave &amp;quot;techniques&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;orders&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;DO THESE PASSES 3 TIMES EACH, ONE AFTER THE OTHER&amp;quot;.  That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;orders&amp;quot; that go with the &amp;quot;Mashing Energy for Intent&amp;quot; series of passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gave us a little &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; to go with each set of passes, but it was far from a detailed explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I can say about that series of passes is, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a goddamn miracle!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those truly are.  If you could see those in Silent Knowledge it would become clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity is &amp;quot;An Abyss&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t work much if you can&amp;#39;t get rid of the internal dialogue, so that the movements can pull you off the edge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they can move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each set is potentially &amp;quot;micro designed&amp;quot; to produce a specific finished position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps more accurately, to move the assemblage point along a path that &amp;quot;teaches you skills&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, without the ability to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; you can&amp;#39;t notice the skills you gain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the question comes up, did Carlos not give us &amp;quot;enough&amp;quot; instructions and explanations?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was he &amp;quot;too cautious&amp;quot; to avoid giving out stuff beginners could pretend to get attention, and thus turn our sorcery discussions and workshops into the same sort of pretending you find in other magical system discussion groups?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s  a REAL BATTLE in here to keep people from turning this into a &amp;quot;Pretend A Thon&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s painful to fight the bad players day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have an unknown number all of a sudden hooking on to my Facebook, to try to turn it into that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this place would be destroyed in no time if it catered to self-pity the way other groups do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose the answer to whether Carlos ought to have given more details is no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But... He died too soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My strategy has been to &amp;quot;seduce&amp;quot; everyone into following his instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By explaining the reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I risk stirring up pretenders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or even creating some &amp;quot;blocks&amp;quot; for the sincere people, who get so far along the J curve that reality starts to change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our mistaken understandings become burdens as the assemblage point moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They manifest as solid, visible objects.  Which trap attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They create &amp;quot;phantom realities&amp;quot;, even if they are &amp;quot;tiny&amp;quot; ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And those trap you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my warning is over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;rethink&amp;quot; of what happens when you do Tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double is perhaps more properly called, &amp;quot;the energy body&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The energy body most likely DOES NOT EXIST, until you make one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any sort of body could be made instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the easiest &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; is created by concentrating his energy of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Art of Dreaming&amp;quot; goes a different route.  You go in to dreams, and &amp;quot;pull out&amp;quot; a very specific form of the energy body.  The double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But darkroom &amp;quot;builds&amp;quot; from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The energy needed has been pushed to the outside by daily living.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity stirs it up.    Tensegrity is &amp;quot;hopeful&amp;quot;.  And it&amp;#39;s physical, so it helps reduce the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tonal Awareness &amp;quot;flows&amp;quot; with the tensegrity, and that &amp;quot;pulls&amp;quot; on the Double awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems that the double awareness is attracted to the tonal awareness. Perhaps the combination wants to return to being able to function as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t have to.  But likes to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the tensegrity gets the double awareness flowing, and it tends to concentrate into puffs.  The double awareness is also attracted to itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We &amp;quot;scoop&amp;quot; it onto the tonal awareness, at the most concentrated points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it tends to &amp;quot;stick&amp;quot; there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can visibly see it! In fact, eventually it becomes &amp;quot;intense&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it collects on the torso it also becomes attracted to itself as a whole, and you end up with a blob of purple awareness lingering on  your torso.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;blue ball of energy&amp;quot; form.  It could simply &amp;quot;leave you&amp;quot; at that point, and if it held together you could do the trick Genaro did, when he showed his blue ball form to Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That awareness is capable of being turned into anything.   Its &amp;quot;ripe&amp;quot; with dreaming attention. In fact, any dream you have is likely just from that form of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not convinced the tonal awareness can dream at all.  We&amp;#39;ll have to see.  I think, the fast visions you get at the green zone are from the double awareness joining in with the tonal, and &amp;quot;helping it see dreams&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;bliss&amp;quot; comes because the body lets up on the constant obsession with the blue zone river of shit.  The body gets to &amp;quot;relax stuff&amp;quot; in ways we couldn&amp;#39;t describe, and bliss is the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because what happens in the green zone seems like something other than it really is, that we have gotten the double awareness to merge with us a bit,  we don&amp;#39;t have a very good understanding of how J curving really works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s skip to a &amp;quot;practical experiment&amp;quot; you can try.  I&amp;#39;ll have to skip a lot of &amp;quot;sights&amp;quot; along the way, which would help to explain this, but become problems for beginners, who will pretend these things, because they are not just &amp;quot;following orders&amp;quot; as Carlos had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Work hard, never neglecting the tensegrity. It&amp;#39;s actually the key to all this.  Internal silence is needed to &amp;quot;let the tensegrity work&amp;quot;, but is NOT the cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later you will realize, the internal dialogue is nothing. Not even important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s important is &amp;quot;focusing the attention&amp;quot;.  And not allowing it to focus anywhere, but where you want it to focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The internal dialogue is merely designed to cause it to focus on 10,000 small things, up at the blue line on the J curve.  To keep you trapped there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you learn to focus ALL of your attention, EXACTLY where you want it to focus, the internal dialogue is no longer a big issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until the &amp;quot;very end&amp;quot; of the J curve.  But that&amp;#39;s another story.  Behind the internal dialogue is the &amp;quot;motivation&amp;quot; for it.  Or &amp;quot;motivations&amp;quot;.  I&amp;#39;m not sure which.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s that which obsesses the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So J curving first removes the internal dialogue as much as possible so the tensegrity can free up some of the double&amp;#39;s awareness, which comes to combine with the tonal awareness  and allows you to &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; things coming from deeper levels of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But past the start of the orange zone you learn to focus your awareness instead, and the internal dialogue isn&amp;#39;t as big of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until the end where your &amp;quot;motivation&amp;quot; becomes a huge issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because &amp;quot;motivation&amp;quot; screws up Silent Knowledge. It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;selector&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the whitish light.  Where you can test these theories out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sitting on pillows in perfect darkness, with the whitish light very visible on all surfaces,  relax and watch the wall until you see some &amp;quot;texture&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; your whitish light.  To eliminate imagining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can force more silence until the whitish light has texture which starts to have &amp;quot;details&amp;quot; of a phantom room, you are good to go.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just gaze into the whitish light not trying to &amp;quot;make it become anything&amp;quot;, and lift one of your hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you see a &amp;quot;dark echo&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you&amp;#39;re in business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the double&amp;#39;s hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Move it around, try the other hand, until you are &amp;quot;certain&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s not just some visual effect of the eyes.  Perfect darkness is mandatory for this experiment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, make your double&amp;#39;s hands &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot; until you actually start to see dark arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or &amp;quot;glass arms&amp;quot; or hands, if you are very far along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what happens if you get the &amp;quot;real arms&amp;quot;.  Your arms, dressed in your sunday &amp;quot;going to church&amp;quot; finest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of those &amp;quot;views&amp;quot; of the double are possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you start to get &amp;quot;purple puff&amp;quot; hands, you skipped to the end of this technique.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shame on you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Move the double&amp;#39;s arms in a flowing motion, outwards at the bottom, then back up in a circle towards your shoulders, and down again.  &amp;quot;Stir&amp;quot; the whitish light while scooping it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whitish light will transform into purple and red, with jet black.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just &amp;quot;converted&amp;quot; the whitish light back to a sight more suitable for the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what &amp;quot;really&amp;quot; happened is, you got the double to &amp;quot;come out from inside you&amp;quot;, and go back into the room.  Still clinging closely to the tonal awareness of your physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drop the hands, keep forcing silence, until the air &amp;quot;clears&amp;quot; and the whitish light is back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice the &amp;quot;shine&amp;quot; in the whitish light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like tiny patches inside the whitish light, which are somewhat &amp;quot;charged&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose, the quantity of those could be described as being the same as dark asphalt, the normal kind with little pebbles glued together by tar, which has of &amp;quot;shiny&amp;quot; pebbles.  The slightly lighter bits of the pebbles, if you move your head around. It&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;highlights&amp;quot; that make it possible to still seen the individual pebbles in the asphalt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an extra &amp;quot;shine&amp;quot; in the whitish light, if you look for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the double awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The combination of the tonal awareness and the double awareness makes the whitish light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can cause it to form &amp;quot;phantom rooms&amp;quot; specifically because it contains the double awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s dreaming awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can &amp;quot;separate&amp;quot; them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This next experiment requires you to not pay attention to whether your eyes are open or closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I said that I &amp;quot;spoiled it&amp;quot;.  So ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But just don&amp;#39;t be interested in &amp;quot;forcing them to stay open&amp;quot;, when you try this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let them do what they want, but don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;make them&amp;quot; do anything in particular.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sitting very still gaze at the whitish light, and notice it extends &amp;quot;inside&amp;quot; your physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whitish light is somewhat like &amp;quot;dream fog&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s easy to &amp;quot;focus it&amp;quot; on your walls, or flat surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it also creates the &amp;quot;second attention fog&amp;quot;.  The &amp;quot;crystalline dreaming fog&amp;quot; is merely you focusing to create mini &amp;quot;surfaces&amp;quot; which reveal dream objects in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it can be &amp;quot;focused&amp;quot; inside your torso as a &amp;quot;flat screen of whitish light&amp;quot;, around the same size as your torso.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a &amp;quot;panel&amp;quot; implanted in the center of the tonal awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;panel of dreaming attention&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the double awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now find the &amp;quot;shiny&amp;quot; bits and pieces on that panel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gently focus on noticing those, and then do your best to ignore them, by forcing all of the remaining traces of the internal dialogue out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, you won&amp;#39;t have a talking voice.  Your attention is too well focused on that &amp;quot;panel&amp;quot; inside you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But your &amp;quot;motivations&amp;quot; are still not &amp;quot;removed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Force silence so well you forget where you are, who you are, or any &amp;quot;expectations&amp;quot; you might have, for what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two things can happen.  We aren&amp;#39;t trying to get one or the other to occur, but to notice there are &amp;quot;2 directions&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you &amp;quot;go&amp;quot; one direction, you will find yourself standing in a dream. Or flying in it, driving inside a car, even falling off a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s  a dream.  And it has absorbed you for an instant.  You even lose lucidity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;ll &amp;quot;bounce out&amp;quot; and back onto the pillows.  Normally people ignore this sort of thing, but you need to notice it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By removing your &amp;quot;motivation&amp;quot;, you sent the double elsewhere.  In this case, he went into his endless phantom realms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can also &amp;quot;retain trace motivations&amp;quot;.  Good ones.

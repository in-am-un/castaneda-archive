Or whatever else you see.\n\nFor instance, you see sunlight ripples on a little stream, and the sparkles bring out the second attention because you are silent.\n\nYou see second attention \"weirdness\" in the ripples.\n\nIt's too tempting to try to move along the water with your gaze.\n\nThat will induce a horizontal shift.  And you got seduced into it, by the daylight and all the sights.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with horizontal shifts.  Those are how you would make use of the dreaming that starts from the gazing.  For instance, to enter a dream that materializes you need a horizontal shift, not a vertical one.\n\n(mostly).\n\nBut those types of shifts don't get you to heightened awareness.\n\nSo your mood won't be better as a result.  It might even be worse.  And if you get too good at horizontal shifts, you might not make it to heightened awareness for days.  Because you're too busy with \"practical magic\" (even if that's just some weird visual thing you can do).\n\nIt's why 4 gates dreamers tend to be bastards.\n\nNo heightened awareness.  No silence too.  So they become even more self-absorbed than they were.\n\nThe cure for horizontal shifting?  Just watch the puffs.  And look for the next cool thing.\n\nIt's the looking for the next cool thing that moves it down, as long as you don't dwell on any particular thing.\n\nAlso, you're in a good position while doing that practice,  to see one of the harder to believe things Carlos taught.\n\nThat you can just do a little Tensegrity flip of the foot as you walk around, and there's actually a reason to do that.\n\nDidn't those explanations in his Tensegrity book seem a little contrived?  Each move had some explanation for how  you could apply it.\n\nOne to \"get a burst of speed\".  It seemed entirely unrelated to that, but Carlos made the claim with full confidence in his book.\n\nHe wasn't making that up!  But you need silence and intent to understand what he meant.\n\nI can see putting some tensegrity moves into Tango dancing, as Julian did (or was it Elias?).\n\nSeems like the dance itself could become more effective than Tensegrity practice.  You could certainly dance yourself into the inorganic being's realm!\n\nBut doing Silvio Manuel's, \"sizing up the situation\" movement, hoping to fit it into your daily activity in a way that makes sense,  seems rather stupid.\n\nUntil  you try it out at the grocery store, while you are following Zuleica's advice.\n\nLet's say you're closely observing all the details of items on the \"noodle shelf\". In my case, trying to find the gluten free noodles.\n\nYou need to step sideways to see the next set of labels. And you use Silvio's sidestep.\n\nThis was while you were using the objects as a way to make yourself silent.  You focus on every tiny detail, in order to externalize your internal dialogue, so you can remove it.\n\nSo you do Silvio's foot movement, since it moves you sideways just as well as any other.\n\nAnd your assemblage point drifts drastically, doing a sudden jump.\n\nYou realize, Carlos wasn't making that up!  He was just trying to explain something so nutty, people would walk away from you if you even mentioned it.\n\nDon't forget, Zuleica didn't just teach to concentrate on a single object.\n\nShe also taught to concentrate on ALL objects. All details.  In order to shut down the internal dialogue.\n\nLike James Bond!  He always sees everything, even the tiniest details, like a bad guy's reflection in a window across the street, which he has to see through a mirror in the department store.\n\nHe's always aware of all details.\n\nHe's a sorcerer!  Even likes to have too many young women around like Carlos (and me too).\n\nWatching all details, all the time, is the opposite of something Carlos tried to explain to us.\n\nGlossing.\n\nI didn't really get it at the time.  I thought of glossing as getting lost in your internal dialogue, in specific moments.\n\nBut we're glossing all the time!\n\nWe don't focus all of our attention from object to object during the day, carefully watching even the tiniest details.\n\nWe just sort of  hurl ourselves out into the world, observing only what's needed to walk or drive the car.\n\nThere's two things wrong with this.\n\nFirst, you aren't focusing your attention consciously all the time. So your ability to gaze does not increase. It's a waste of the entire day.\n\nYou don't learn to concentrate your awareness, on demand. It's all dispersed and lost.\n\nAnd, there's very little chance for intent to play with you during the day if you keep staring off into space.\n\nIn the dark room, looking at impossible things (puffs), intent can \"gift\" you when it is reasonable to do so. To help you learn.\n\nIf you stop glossing all day, the daytime becomes the same as the darkroom.\n\nIntent can follow where your awareness flows now, because it isn't focused inward, on your phony idea of a self.\n\nSo if you are walking in silence, observing everything closely, intent can toss in a gift.\n\nZuleica says, the spirit will eventually reveal itself to you if you watch all details all the time.\n\nThe spirit can reveal itself many ways.  It can cause \"coincidences\" that are beyond anything reasonable.\n\nBut it can also reveal itself as \"intent bliss\", when you find just the right sight.\n\nThe Zen people are intent bliss junkies, going on about falling leaves and such, as if  you could pretend to see a leaf fall as a \"nothingness\" representation, and learn that way.\n\nOf course you can't. But it is the side effect of no internal dialogue, and not constantly glossing because of your idea of self.\n\nAbout dreaming doubles eyes versus ours.\n\nWe switch back and forth in the dark room.\n\nBut, both occur at the same time.\n\nSo really, we ignore one or the other.\n\nI suppose there will come a day when we are like Nyei's version of Carlos, in  a  recent interview.\n\nHanging out with you, at the same time he's teaching your dreaming double.\n\nI believe she said he \"speaks to both\".\n\nOf course, it's the lack of real magic in her life which makes her hope that's true.\n\nBut it's still probably what happens as you get more advanced.\n\nAnd if you deal with inorganic beings, it happens even more.\n\nYou are aware of both at the same time, or perhaps after one or the other happens ,and you can make it available to the opposite side.\n\nIt's not completely appropriate, but let me pass on a technique, so people understand Zuleica's daytime silence technique.\n\nFind some nice ground covering, or a huge patch of well trimmed bushes with a large flat surface made of leaves.\n\nFind one with little flowers, so that the bees are buzzing all over it, going from flower to flower.\n\nOr if you are looking at trimmed shrubs at the DMV, where the grass is covered in dog poop, then watch for the festering flies all over the shrub.\n\nGaze so you see the entire thing, and force yourself silent, until you see multiple insects flying, all at the same time. Gaze at the complexity and endless activity.  \n\nAlternately, find some larger ants who are active and don't tend to bite, and watch the ant hill they're coming from, in the same manner. Try to see more than one at once, in silence.\n\nThen ask yourself, if the universe is so vast and there are so many worlds, and each world has endless \"spots\" of awareness engaged in activity,  does intent really need what you are looking at to be \"important\"? \n\nI mean, will it help you out, even if you are looking at sand?\n\nOf course! \n\nHow could it care?  Our little dark room is nothing special.\n\nCertainly not more special than dog dung eating flies festering over the well trimmed bushes at the DMV.  Amidst the discarded trash.\n\nBut you have to give intent a chance to play, outside the dark room.\n\nA couple of hours a night is  just not enough time to learn in.\n\nI understand the \"levels of enlightenment\" thing now.\n\nYou get to heightened awareness.\n\nBut then you have to \"relearn\" the world.\n\nHeightened awareness returns you to your childhood journey of exploration.\n\nYou were yanked out of it by cookies and fear of other people.\n\nForced to obsess on getting pitiful attention from other people.\n\nOnce you return to exploration, you have a lot to learn.\n\nIn the realms of magic.\n\nThat's why we need the daytime. There's too much to learn, and it comes slowly.", "edited": 1607276486.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_geumcl8", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember with puffery, if you watch the puffs in silence you move towards heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you watch them with the idea that they are real things, and especially if you find something to do with them as &amp;quot;real things&amp;quot;, the assemblage point moves horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect it&amp;#39;s easy for that to happen in daylight, since there are so many distractions which might be compatible with the puffs.

"That's not actually far off from one view of it in the darkroom.\n\nSo far I've seen:\n\nCholita:  the blue ball of energy touring around the ceiling (even once in a small airplane leaving Beijing),   a sparkling cloud of blue and white which gives off a special pleasant odor that pulls you into dreaming a bit, a green phantom which glows dimly but has too little mass to go far into the second attention (it breaks apart into pieces),  an intense whitish phantom that's no longer transparent, probably aided by the energy of Minx (her IOB),  a dull bluish phantom inside a dream scene but which can look outside the dream, and several versions of a dead woman, with or without Zombie escort.  Sometimes smashed flat.\n\nBasically it can take the appearances it has in ordinary dreams. ALL of them.\n\nThat's the same guy in your dreams!  He's just not \"aligned\" to our world.\n\nBut when it finally gets into the real world, it's plagued by not being in perfect alignment with your own particular copy of reality, so it can be \"spread a little thing\" across multiple phantom copies, making it transparent in your copy.\n\nUnless you try to grab it...  Then it \"snaps\" into alignment and looks fully solid.\n\nMe: a \"snowman\" made  of intense purple puffs, a realistic looking arm or two, with different clothes than I have on. Dark echoes of arms and feet that don't move precisely the same way,    \"Glass\" body parts (can see the edges but no details), a grim copy of myself sitting on the bed for far longer than is comfortable,  a fat copy of Cholita (still me),  and best of all, a transparent copy of your self sitting right next to you. In fact, merging with you at times, as if it were a ghost who didn't mind overlapping with your physical body.\n\nI've also \"remote viewed\" what my own double was doing. He's just off in some dream, exploring.\n\nIf you can get your physical body \"inside\" it,  even just a few inches overlap,  you pick up its senses.  Super sight into the realm of magic is easiest to notice, but you also get his overall \"feeling\" about things.\n\nOptimistic, confident, devious, prankish. He's got  unlimited power and no body to harm, so he's a bit of a brat. It could in fact be, that stalking is based on the behavior of the double.\n\nSince people can use their double for stalking (Genaro was virtually always in his double when Carlos was around him), it seems natural that the physical beings on stalking missions with those in their doubles, would find their behavior invigorating, and tend to copy it.\n\nSo maybe, the mood of stalking, is the mood of the double?\n\nBut the double has no evil motivations, no greed, no need for human endorsement or company.  He doesn't suffer from the problems that drive organic beings to behave badly.\n\nSo he's not at all like the trolls who come in here to get attention for themselves.\n\nYet still, he's a bit of a contrarian, just for fun.\n\nThe IOBs are a little like that too.  With their \"one dead eye\" looks.\n\nProbably being brattish is just a natural thing for beings with no organic body, like a tiger cub is a bit of a brat, when interacting with the other cubs.\n\nBut has no malice towards them.\n\nBUT, please learn to more your assemblage point to where the double becomes fully visible.  Sorcery is REAL!!!\n\nBefore that point, you should be able to wiggle your fingers in the air and produce a little \"magical cloud of sparkles\", and then you should be able to pull that open with your hands, and look at another world, right in front of you.\n\nAnd you should be able to literally walk right in there, with aid from dark energy.\n\nOr be able to find dreams floating in the air, one after the other, and \"zip\" into each of them, staying only a few seconds so you don't get confused about where you belong.\n\nI'd say, when you can zip into 3 dreams in a row, one after another, standing up, fully awake, no drugs, eyes open, remaining in each only 5 seconds, then you get to assume that if you see a copy of yourself, it's the double.\n\nI put that qualification in there, just to make sure it's not a half asleep state that makes him show up.\n\nWhen the assemblage point moves halfway into the orange line on the J curve, you can easily do those things I listed as tests.\n\nThe double becomes visible **past** that.\n\nSo sometimes you hear someone claim they can perceive their double, but the signs they moved their assemblage point far enough are not present.  And if you even pointed those out, they'd get angry because they had no clue about it.\n\nWith women however, the rules get fuzzy.\n\nThey can \"cheat\".\n\nBut don't...  We need the sober witches type,  for teaching.\n\nWe have Cholita, but she'd rather kick ass than teach anyone.\n\nYou guys have no idea...\n\nI was once in an expensive grocery store, where they have to treat all of the customers well.\n\nA woman approached Cholita to ask if she wanted to hear about the selection she was looking at.\n\nCholita turned around, and shoved her away using her palms on the woman's shoulders.\n\nA good 3 feet of a shove!  She might even have risen above the floor an inch while she traveled.\n\nThe woman asked me what was up with my wife.\n\nAll I could say was, \"She's like that.\"", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hy43jm5", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not actually far off from one view of it in the darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#39;ve seen:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita:  the blue ball of energy touring around the ceiling (even once in a small airplane leaving Beijing),   a sparkling cloud of blue and white which gives off a special pleasant odor that pulls you into dreaming a bit, a green phantom which glows dimly but has too little mass to go far into the second attention (it breaks apart into pieces),  an intense whitish phantom that&amp;#39;s no longer transparent, probably aided by the energy of Minx (her IOB),  a dull bluish phantom inside a dream scene but which can look outside the dream, and several versions of a dead woman, with or without Zombie escort.

It's from Taisha's \"new\" book.\n\n\u201cNow, I\u2019ll show you another way to silence the mind,\u201d she said. \"Sit quietly, breathe naturally and without thinking, look at the feather.\"\n\nShe said that I should focus my attention on the feather until I had merged with it.\n\nShe said that it was possible to merge with whatever object one was observing so that it was no longer a separate entity, but something alive and part of one\u2019s own energetic being.\n\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d I asked. \u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone know that the world is made of separate objects?\u201d Zuleica arched an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cIs it really?\u201d she asked. \"Objects are only separate when we think about them. When we observe them, they merge into a single energy field that also includes our energy bodies.\"\n\nShe looked at me to see if I understood what I was saying. I must have given her a silly look because she added, \u201cI just revealed a sorcery secret to you and you insist on taking it as an ordinary statement. Think about what I said.\"\n\nNote: Zuleica is teaching Taisha a series of three exercises to concentrate/achieve inner silence. Taisha is sitting in front of a table. For the exercise mentioned in the quote \u2014which is the second one\u2014 she's working with a large crow feather.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis is a technique done in light, not full darkness.\n\nBut the idea is pretty much the same. Find something coming from the second attention, and use the view of that to help achieve inner silence.  By means of the feedback the view provides.\n\nNo silence, no view.  More silence, more view of strange things.\n\nI supposed the \"feedback\" would be the view of the feather merged with yourself, and I presume any internal dialogue returning would stop that.\n\nSince that technique came along at this moment, I'd suggest anyone who can't make a dark room but wants to dabble, should try it.\n\nIt's an \"Intent chance\".  A cubic centimeter of chance, to start using that technique.\n\nIt came in from outside.\n\nIt's basically \"directed gazing\".  \n\nTaisha knows what the results of the gazing will be ahead of time.\n\nNormally in gazing you just take whatever weirdness you can find, since it has to come from the second attention.  Anything coming from there, while you are silent, moves the assemblage point.\n\nHowever, we don't know if Zuleica, who seems to have been able to move assemblage points herself (from same book) gave Taisha any help.  In fact, we don't know that Zuleica wasn't helping Carlos during his hundreds of hours of finger wiggling, with Zuleica near by.\n\nAnd I'm not clear on the state Taisha was in, when brought to Zuleica. I vaguely recall she was in \"lingering heightened awareness\", meaning don Juan had pushed her bubble, and she didn't fully return to the previous state.   But I can't remember where I heard that.\n\nIt's the same problem with the Zuleica techniques we're using.\n\nCarlos was in heightened awareness when he did those.  So you can't just sit down and wiggle your fingers, with your internal dialogue raging and your assemblage point at it's normal location.\n\nThus we do what Carlos was doing at the end,  in private classes.  We play with colors to move it to heightened awareness, so we can finish the finger wiggling.  It's the only variation of those techniques which we know for sure can work from ordinary positions of the assemblage point.\n\nThe Tensegrity is also based on that working.\n\nI should mention, the finger wiggling will in fact eventually produce a sensation \"as thick as water\", where you wiggle.\n\nIt's a little cobwebby for me, not a thick stream.  Usually.  And then when I'm thinking it's too threadlike, I hit a burst and it's more like a beam of thickness.\n\nBottom line, it works.  Strange things start to happen also.  It's just a longer road than we'd like.  But it pays off eventually.  The luminous body becomes more visible, you can feel very strong cobwebs there, which are reliably attached to other parts of the body.  The wiggling fingers put on a light show for you, and you can even see the second attention assemblage point, floating out where it's said to be located.  Like fibers of vague light, with sparkles.\n\nIt's further out than you'd expect...\n\nThe air becomes thicker there and there are temperature variations, if you wiggle a long time over many days, in perfect silence.\n\nIt builds up too.  A gain you make the previous day, is surprisingly strong the next, right from the start.\n\nFolding in half at the end, maybe not.\n\nBut that would be fine.  When Emilito changed to another being in Taisha's book, he folded in on himself.  It seems to just be what it looks like, during a change over.\n\nOne fine detail of Taisha's silence technique is that Zuleica is advising to visualize a bit.  Visualize a result she's told her about.\n\nThat directs intent. She's expecting something, and watching for it.\n\nWhen we return to basics and play with the puffs a little more intently, I believe we're doing much the same thing.  Getting a little more involved than just being a blank slate.\n\nI suspect Juan has the same problem in dark room gazing that I do.  Too much to see.\n\nSo we like to be at least partially \"blank slate\", to see what comes along.\n\nAnd yet when we reduce the level of blank slate, and go back to playing with puffs as if they were real substances, our assemblage point moves faster.\n\nZuleica is indicating that more \"intensity\" is a good thing.\n\nI wrote a post a while back about enslaving Mr. DoubleTake. It think that's along the same lines.\n\nIf you turn off Mr. DoubleTake entirely (when you're at the end of t he J curve), you end up seeing other worlds around you, or intercepting dreams.\n\nYou pick up intent from the air.\n\nBut if you enslave Mr. DoubleTake, forcing him to focus his attention on what you want to do, you can burn holes in reality and force things to spill from them.\n\nThe blank slate versus focused also works differently when playing with IOBs.\n\nFancy likes the focused, as long as she can figure out how to get me to focus on the right thing.\n\nIt produces lateral shifts of the assemblage point, because your eyes \"grab onto\" something, tugging your assemblage point to see that thing better.\n\nIf you go \"blank slate\" around your IOB, they tend to push your assemblage point themselves, by zipping by and tapping you on the back.\n\nInstead of you intercepting random intent, they try to select for you.\n\nWe should analyze as much of that book as possible.  It seems more practical than those of Carlos, which are all over the place with too much to try, so that no one actually tries anything long enough to make it work.\n\nPlus Zuleica is cool!\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Taisha's Silence Technique", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_jj364a", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1603813654.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1603812254.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This got posted in another place, but it&amp;#39;s worth analyzing.

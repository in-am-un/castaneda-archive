Long read warning: \n\nI began my darkroom session at 11:17 PM, and this time, I decided to shift my seated position to a different spot that felt vaguely more comfortable. The result was good, and I reached the beginning of the Red zone in just 10 minutes. Perhaps my crummy photoshop attempts at describing the initial J-curve effects in previous posts pleased Intent? \n\nWho knows, but soon after, I started viewing rainbows, a \"Cosmic galaxy web\" pattern overlay on everything, and the \"treeline silhouette\" scene appearing everywhere. I realized that because I had previously described these things, they became my prevailing view for a period of time in the darkroom. I began to understand why Carlos and Don Juan were not always keen on descriptions.\n\nAfter this, puffs of various sizes, transparency degrees, and colors (mostly reddish purple, blue, purple and purple/black) began swarming everywhere. Some puffs expanded to create large screens that formed scenes in each direction I turned my head. Most scenes were the same tree-line view I had seen before, but this time, they evolved to include rocks and a warping rock tunnel.\n\nIn between viewing the scenes, I grabbed a rainbow band and formed it into a circle, as if I were Doctor Strange creating a portal. This created a view of a different scene that continued to manifest inside and float by right past me! I could also fully move the puffs as if they were energy balls, manipulating them like an erratic Tai Chi master. Only my energy balls were real, not simply imagined and invisible!\n\nAt this position of the AP, Pandora\u2019s box worked very well! I combined puffs into a super puff and \"Hadouken!\" them across my darkroom. They\u2019d hit the wall, and scenes would begin to take shape in a large, roughly 10 ft by 8 ft visual format. Very entertaining! \n\nDespite the fact gazing at 100% power is ill-advised, I decided to gaze at that level anyway to see what would happen. The scenes became much more vivid, and I noticed details I hadn't seen before, such as rainbow/sunset skies, animating in various ways. However, I quickly \u201cran out of gas\u201d and dozed off repeatedly for the next 30 to 40 minutes. Scenes would appear to be animating the very same mini-dream vision I\u2019d have each time I\u2019d doze off an woke back up. It\u2019s cool that the double also enjoys any kind of dream we have and wants to participate!\n\nWhen I regained my composure, Fairy appeared! She took the form of a tiny, twinkling, bright blue puff zipping by. I asked, \"Fairy, is that you?\" and she manifested a series of anime girl faces in front of me, confirming my suspicion. The images she manifested were similar to this one here:\n\n[How Fairy appeared within a blue puff. Rendered using Stable Diffusion](https://preview.redd.it/2daf1zgj7gja1.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ee27ec173291f812d37e817442e64b60600285a)\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t a clear enough indication, I asked again \u201cFairy is that you?\u201d She made the humidifier right outside my darkroom gurgle loudly right then in agreement! I welcomed her while she turned into a more generic vectorized face of a woman. As a side note, here is a rough example of how IOBs manifest, at least in my view:\n\n[IOB manifesting. Actual appearance is a bit more \\\\\"vectorized\\\\\" with varying transparency](https://reddit.com/link/117rdhv/video/xdeiltrk7gja1/player)\n\nI put her on my hand, blew on her, and fanned her, trying to add energy, though I wasn't sure if it worked. I asked her if she could be clearer, and the small blue puff she manifested as stretched downwards to an oval shape thing, and I could barely see something moving around, taking shape. It appeared to me as if there was a girl spinning in a circle, though I found it hard to believe. Eventually, she became unmistakably clear as Alice from Alice in Wonderland, right there on my palm, spinning in circles. This GIF shows how she appeared to manifest before settling down as a stable animation of a spinning Alice from Alice in the Wonderland: \n\n[Fairy beginning to assume the form of Alice. Another Stable Diffusion render](https://reddit.com/link/117rdhv/video/k254ztvt7gja1/player)\n\nWe communicated for some time using my humidifier gurgles: one loud gurgle for yes, and a no gurgling sound for no. I'd like to add that there is no way this was a mere coincidence; my humidifier gurgles only very occasionally and it definitely does not gurgle loud enough to hear clearly through a closed door. She was indeed controlling physical matter!\n\nI could manifest scenes by pulling on puffs and intending a scene to form. In one instance, I stretched a puff to create a scene, and Fairy zipped right in there as a blue puff in the scene. This was a scene of a rail car moving down a railroad through a forested area. Later, this scene became a long, windy tunnel that opened up to rocks, large rocks, and clearly some kind of cave system. I asked her if we were viewing her world, and my humidifier gurgled loudly, though I'm not sure if that was actually a representation of her world or if we were just viewing a phantom dream world starring Fairy.\n\nFairy was insistent on showing me this rock tunnel scene. She appeared to zip through every scene I viewed while I gazed into them, but I wasn't able to see the scene through to the \"end\" because I'd lose concentration or my internal dialogue would act up again. Maybe she kept me viewing that scene to steal some energy? Who knows; she's welcome to have some of mine. After all, she added a ton of magical things to my darkroom!\n\nLater on, I noticed bright white puffs attached themselves to my hands, and I could then paint the darkness out of my darkroom using my puff hands! The effect was very similar to using a patterned brush to paint in digital art tools like Photoshop. Anywhere I waved my puff hands turned into the patterned view of the \"cosmic galaxy web,\" super fun messing around creating \"art\" using my puff hands!\n\nAt one point, I noticed a very convincing view into another world, unlike the puff scenes I had been viewing all night. I assumed it was an enticing portal to enter a dream world, but a certain fear overtook me. I feared what would happen if I were to walk through and where I'd end up. My internal dialogue kicked back up, but I forced it off the best I could and just walked on through the portal anyway\n\n\\*BANG!\\* My head collided with the closet door with a resounding thud. Nope, this structure was not yet a true portal to another world! Maybe with more time it may indeed become a real portal? I hope so but you should know that expectation kills progress in the darkroom!\n\nToo many other occurrences slipped from my memory, lost in the midst of my playful interactions with Fairy and my random puff experiments.\n\nAs the night wore on and I extended my stay in the darkroom for the third or fourth time, the light became increasingly intense, fluctuating in brightness until it was impossible to locate the door's light leak. Indeed, the \"light leaks\" now permeated every corner of my room, making it a legitimate challenge to exit. I resorted to feeling my way around like a blind person, searching for the door handle in order to finally open it.\n\nUpon leaving, I turned to bid farewell to Fairy. She spun up on my hand, spinning in that miniature version of Alice in Wonderland. Then, in an ethereal twirl, she transformed into a small ball of blue light and zipped out vertically as if she were a luminous UFO warping into the unknown.\n\nI glanced at the time: 3:39 AM. A new record for me - 4 hours and 22 minutes in the darkroom and yet I still felt reluctant to leave. Fatigue was not a factor, and the darkroom seemed to follow me into my bedroom. As I attempted to drift off to sleep, I realized that closing my eyes or keeping them open made no difference - I was still witnessing the \"cosmic galaxy web\" overlay and green and blue puffs.

As long as she's not all talk and wishful thinking.\n\nBut the male has to do waking dreaming, due to the lack of sleeping dreaming talent in men and their enormous ability to lie to themselves and change things to be \"easier\" without realizing that won't work.\n\nIt seems as if Men work harder if there's a woman waiting for them, and the results can't be pretended.\n\nBut what's new in that?\n\nI don't know any men who will actually fix something in the house, unless a woman makes them do it.   I'm sure such (gay?) men exist, but I don't know any.\n\nThey'll just \"let it slide\".\n\nSo women are SUPPOSED to lend men \"energy\" (praise for chores), causing them to do more than they would on their own.\n\nIt's the \"Honey Do\" list!\n\nCholita won't do that, so I don't see it as a bad thing.

I want to see those fangs.\n\nBut some Russian witches I know, are happy just to \"feel\" the creepy snake demon.\n\nAnd if it actually got solid looking, they'd think twice about that ceremony.\n\nThey're perfectly fine with just \"knowing\" they succeeded.\n\nWhich is in fact what powerful seers do. They don't actually need to see videos in the air, if they can feel one coming on.  And already know the plot.\n\nI don't like that.\n\nI want to see the entire episode.  I don't want the \"crib notes\" for \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\".\n\nBut women can make do with the crib notes, and it's perfectly valid. For witchcraft.\n\nSo they tend not to \"finish\" things that aren't \"socially endorsed\".\n\nYou can find this in the books at several points.\n\nLikely second ring of power.\n\nNotice how La Gorda and the Little sisters do some astonishing magic for Carlos, and then admit it never worked that well before.\n\nThen they get pissed off at him and attack to prove he's impotent.\n\nWhich he was.\n\nBut both are surprised to find out that Carlos' double can kick their asses (literally).\n\nIt almost seems like the normal world of men and women in story form!\n\nYour problem is going to be the same one everyone has.\n\nIt takes steady, daily effort.

As long as she&amp;#39;s not all talk and wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the male has to do waking dreaming, due to the lack of sleeping dreaming talent in men and their enormous ability to lie to themselves and change things to be &amp;quot;easier&amp;quot; without realizing that won&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems as if Men work harder if there&amp;#39;s a woman waiting for them, and the results can&amp;#39;t be pretended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s new in that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know any men who will actually fix something in the house, unless a woman makes them do it.

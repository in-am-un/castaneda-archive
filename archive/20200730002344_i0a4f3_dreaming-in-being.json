So if you can take an inventory of what&amp;#39;s going on right now, in front of you, you can defeat it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But until then, you&amp;#39;ll take an inventory of the crap you have inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So no matter how advanced you are, you&amp;#39;ll have images pop into your mind at the rate of the Eagle&amp;#39;s commands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to think them. The eagle wants you to take an inventory of the current situation. I suppose he&amp;#39;s a bit of a voyeur.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you don&amp;#39;t have to worship the inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If images or words appear in the mind, you should be able to just toss them out, as long as it doesn&amp;#39;t endlessly trigger more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The recap breaks those links.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t cause you to completely get over what&amp;#39;s bugging you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a mistake to believe that, because you&amp;#39;ll feel like you aren&amp;#39;t doing recap right, when you still care about something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you might end up deifying someone who&amp;#39;s done a lot of recap, as if that makes them a saint or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uncle raped you?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry. It&amp;#39;ll always bug you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you don&amp;#39;t have to dwell on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially,  it makes you sick and tired of thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its like when you watch your favorite movie too many times, and you just can&amp;#39;t stomach any of it again.  You know what each plot twist leads to, and none interests you anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the purpose of recap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_i0a4f3", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/i0a4f3/dreaminginbeing/fzqmsea/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1596124134.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1596124134.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fzqkmfx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Luisyelsol", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1596123207.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fzo5zvc", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3x9578py", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "This gave me a more understanding meaning of recapitulation.

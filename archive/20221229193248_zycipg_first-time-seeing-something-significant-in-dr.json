Also, while I have learned a few magical passes, I don't know any of the full sets by heart yet and I'm not sure if it counts to just do one or two, or if I know a few from one set I often get the order mixed up. Night before last however I had a great DR experience! I started off in my bedroom with the lights off, but watching the series for intent from Cleargreen. I'd never done this one before but it felt so powerful in spite of my occasional failure to follow along perfectly. Then I went into my closet and sat down on a blanket in the corner. For a moment I just sat there staring into the blackness around me. Now, I've always been able to see energy to some extent, sometimes it takes a good amount of focus,  but sometimes it's like I can just see the world around me vibrating, day or night, sober (or high but that's cheating and I haven't used drugs for over 3 years now). But nothing like what \"seeing\" is described as in the books, just visible vibration. And darkness always moves if I focus on it, but until now I didn't know I should actually be looking for something.  So I'm sitting there and I start doing the shield breath (as taught to Taisha by Clara) bc as excited as I am to see puffs and IOBs, I'm also rather frightened once I'm in DR. When I bring my breath to my forhead and hold it I'm looking in the direction of where I'm holding it and suddenly I see a purple glimmer, not a puff, but I focus on it and it's moving, and it's beautiful, not scary at all. As I'm watching it I notice it's moving in an almost clockwise rotation, but what was truly amazing is when I expand my focus and see that the purple is more of a shadow, what's really moving in the darkness is a big black bird, as if in front of the sun it's just a silhouette and it's like the purple glimmer is the sun behind it. I could see it's wings spread out and the shape of its head and beak and its just gliding through the blackness. I was in awe, this was truly magical...in my limited scope of what that means.]\n\nFollowing up, I'm going to continue practicing along with the video for the long form for unbending Intent, even if I don't have DR space to do it in yet, I figure by the time I learn it by heart I'll have been able to build a bigger space to practice (and develped my sight more so i can actually see it in action). Also working on some of the not-doing passes that can be done in my limited space.

My husband is a Christian (we both were raised in the church), and I have to find work arounds to explain my practice so I can make room for it in our life. The things I have explained to him, mainly about silence, he supports and encourages bc he knows how much I struggle with my internal dialogue, in spite of not knowing anything about CC. My thoughts have long been my greatest source of suffering,  its easy for me to view them as a foreign installation and Im grateful to finally know there is something real I can do about it.\nIve given up thinking it&amp;#39;s  my responsibility to save or enlighten anyone, so as much as I would love to be able to show him everything I&amp;#39;m learning, I keep my explanations very surface and trust that if he&amp;#39;s meant to walk the same path then Spirit or Intent will bring him around when it&amp;#39;s time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_zycipg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/zycipg/first_time_seeing_something_significant_in_dr/j2bt22j/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1672452868.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j29jl0z", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_zycipg", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "Well done!!

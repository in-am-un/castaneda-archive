It\u2019s been distorted and elaborated, but it still gets back to the bible. You have to check out those resources to understand how it all goes back to the bible. Don't forget how the old testament mentions \"the witch of Endor\", demons, angels, and such.  There's also a sorcerer in there who talks to animals.\n\nLet me sum up western magic:   You can't do anything, you need an angel or a demon, or God himself to help.  So they repeat formulas, do rituals, designed to lure an angel or a demon. It\u2019s not much different than Carlos\u2019 \u201callies\u201d.  \n\nOr, you modify your behavior and tap into the hidden promise in the bible.  This is a thread that goes through it constantly, and is the source of Qabalah.   The gist of it is, God wants to give all of us his power to just say something, and have it come to pass.  But we're such wretched beings, that would cause havoc in the world. Certainly, politicians would be dropping dead left and right.  And bill collectors.\n\nSo the scholars have deduced (from the writings) that God gives it to people in pieces, according to their behavior.  Sometimes without them knowing.  Jacob killed his favorite wife by mistake, because he was given that power.\n\nThe book of Abramelin is an example of how to get that power using a ritual, and then what you can do with it.  As I recall, he uses acrostics similar to the way the old testament was encoded to prevent alterations.  He puts the acrostics in his hat, or weaves them into his braids.  Something you see in Los Angeles to this day.\n\nIf you want something along Carlos' line, I suspect you have to go to shamanistic traditions.

I believe it\u2019s from the early 1950s.  \n\nIt\u2019s pretty obviously a made up thing, designed to get women to take off their clothes for the author. (But then some could accuse Carlos of the same thing).\n\nEven though it\u2019s pretty obviously made up, it\u2019s been adopted widely, and now you have the wiccan movement.  \n\nMaybe some of the others who read this can pipe in on magic books?

Tata Kachora claims to be don Juan, but he's too stupid to lie very well  and you can find his mistakes in an article on the Joanie Mitchell website.  Two from our own community went to investigate him and found he has his dates wrong on when he supposedly taught Carlos.\n\nNot to mention there's now 9 eye witnesses to the identity of don Juan, including a Buddhist Church official in Mexico.  And it wasn't chubby old Kachora.\n\nHis henchmen however, just won't give up. When the old geezer finally dies off they hope to take over as \"the true apprentice\" and continue cheating others. One features himself in a rambo headband sitting next to Kachora, dressed up like a character from Walker, Texas Ranger.\n\nThat man attacked the cartoon someone made of Carlos looking for his spot. Insisted they needed to use a Native American voice or it was \"culture appropriation\".\n\nTotally clueless they are.\n\nSo that could simply be another \"Kachora Zombie\".   We came under attack by those guys for a good  year or two.\n\nThey don't want real magic to be a quality of practicing sorcery, because they only have \"factoids\" they memorized from the books.\n\nBut it really doesn't matter who this person was.\n\nJust look in here!\n\nThe magic we're doing from Tensegrity kicks the butt of any Asian or Western Saint. Puts the Buddha himself to shame.  Makes Milarepa look like he was on drugs.\n\nIt's a typical thing attackers do.\n\nGloss.\n\nThey see a shiny object, the magic in this subreddit, as something they can dominate or knock down to \"wrestle their way above others\" in the river of shit.\n\nI don't know what Victor's deal is, but I'm sure we have senior members who do.\n\nI just know Carlos complained about him early on,  perhaps in early 1995, and when I looked on the web Victor seemed so childish that I felt sorry for him.\n\nCarlos had endless frauds pretending to know him personally, to know don Juan, to be don Juan, or to be La Gorda.\n\nThe scams are endless, but not too surprising.\n\nIt happens with other magical systems.  It's true that those don't actually have any magic worth obsessing over, but they do have our green line effects.  And that's enough to go to people's heads.\n\nSo the fakers in those green line systems also try to connect themselves to someone more well known.\n\nThe Chinese are all very familiar with that trick, but for some reason westerners aren't as clued in.\n\nIn China, they say it always starts with a story about how a new magical system is hundreds of years old, and comes from some secret sacred scroll, or a lesser known sage chinese Daoist or martial artist.\n\nYou can find that on Youtube if you look around.  Search for clown outfits on Asian men.\n\nBut then, there's obviously no magic in those systems.   Just some man using costumes and pretty words, to try to appeal to sad angry men who want to pretend to be powerful.  So he can steal money from them.\n\nIn those \"systems\" no one is learning any magic, no one is teaching anything that makes sense, and anyone who was honest would look at it and see what the Chinese instantly see.\n\nAnother broken man trying to build himself up with pretend magic, so he can steal from others.\n\nLike Mantak Chia does. He seems to have stolen darkroom now, and is charging for workshops.\n\nSo Victor claims to have known Carlos, but so did Merilyn Tunneshende make that claim.  And so does Armando whose protectors now claim he was in private classes.  Which he wasn't.\n\nWe have 3 in here who actually did take private classes and hung out with Carlos  hundreds of times.\n\nBut supposedly Victor was in the room with him once, at some time?\n\nIt's news to me.  Carlos never mentioned it, and he certainly complained about Victor \"riding on his back\" like a monkey.\n\nThis claim by this commenter is also totally clueless.\n\nIt's a \"first 4 book\" obsession.\n\nThe first 4 books were rather confusing, and greatly attracted pretenders.\n\nIt's not until the remaining 13 books and publications that you begin to understand what the first 4 books were about.\n\nIntent.\n\nSorcery is the mastery of intent.\n\nIntent is what guides awareness to flow into specific emanations.\n\nAnd assemble the view of reality you end up facing.\n\nThis isn't a sacred chinese scroll from 200 years ago. Or \"the word of God\" handed down to us by the prophets.\n\nIt's what you're learning to perceive in here!  Yourself.\n\nAnd also what I wrote about the first post I made here.\n\nIt's \"seeing energy\".\n\nUsing your fingers you can manipulate reality right before your eyes.\n\nLocate energetic patches and use them to travel to other worlds, or back in time.\n\nTensegrity is just a system Carlos created, to preserve all of the movements he'd learned from the lineage, which manipulate intent.\n\nBut Victor is only obsessed with \"TOLTEC!!!\"\n\nSo he puts that on book covers to  rip off people who don't know any better.\n\nVictor... It's OLMEC.\n\nThe fact is, you'll find Tensegrity ALL OVER the books.\n\nThe gait of power for example.\n\nOr don Juan's reaching up into the air like he grabbed a doorknob, twisted it, and suddenly a giant rabbit materialized before Carlos' eyes.\n\nThat's the Pandora's Box pass in a slightly modified form.\n\nThere's also marching in circles with don Genaro, to assemble a hellish world so Carlos could learn how to deliberately tune in on a specific assemblage point position.\n\nThere's don Juan's back stretching, which by the way your own back might eventually imitate.\n\nMine now goes, \"pop, pop, pop, pop..\" if I reach far to the side.\n\nTensegrity seems to alter the skeletal structure, just the way don Juan's had been altered.\n\nLa Gorda uses Tensegrity to open a sliding glass door through which Carlos and her can escape the attacking allies.  That pass has a name, and Jadey can tell you about it. It was taught in Women's classes.\n\nLa Gorda also used Tensegrity for flying. She pissed into her hands, flung it into the air, and as it fell in the twilight it created sparkles, which allowed her to locate the \"red lines\".\n\nThose are very powerful. I once accidentally uncovered those, and my Ally \"Fairy\" overdosed on them.\n\nWhen viewing the raw emanations you can easily see sparkling fragments of pieces of them.\n\nIntersections between various emanations, where the flow of awareness produces the illusion of fragments in the cross talk.\n\nThat's where Silent Knowledge resides. In that interplay in Man's band of emanations.\n\nIf you can find the red ones by wiggling your fingers in the air, a tensegrity pass and also described by La Gorda in the books, you can grab those and they'll pull you up into the air.\n\nIt's how don Juan leaped over houses in the books, or why he told Carlos in the first 4 books that there was no point in leaping over the eucalyptus trees.\n\nWhy, just to scare the indians?\n\nFrankly, this claim by this bad man is so childish that if he returns here we ought to question him closely.\n\nYou'll find his head explode extra fast.\n\nBut it was a good thing he posted that!\n\nI've made a folder to show all the examples of Tensegrity in the books, and also show the bad guys  like Victor Sanchez or Tata Kachora who are so ignorant they haven't got even a beginner's understanding of the books.\n\nNot even the first 4.\n\nBy the way, I sat (stood actually) in a room and watched Carlos make up tensegrity many times.\n\nAs did Jadey.\n\nTensegrity was just a martial arts like \"form system\".  Because Carlos liked martial arts.\n\nLike the Katas of the Japanese.\n\nDesigned to protect individual movements, and show their application.\n\nStellar Hatch for example REALLY DOES stretch you to the nearest star, to bring back a yellow puff of star awareness which when you have mastered it, results in a stunning display on your floor.\n\nWith a face!\n\nI was playing with my \"Star Entity\" Stella for a good 20 minutes last night.\n\nAnd \"Affection for the Energy Body\" really does mold those purple puffs into a duplicate of yourself.\n\nAt the end  you can switch over to him and walk right through the wall into another world.\n\nFrom Tensegrity.\n\nOr you can give evil Victor your money, put on a Rambo headband, and memorize \"the rules of warriors\" from the books.\n\nWhich is obviously what this commenter is doing, judging by his attack oriented user name.\n\nBut I have to thank him.\n\nIt'll make a good cartoon.\n\nWith Victor as the bad guy.\n\nAny other tensegrity moves from the books anyone noticed?\n\nLike Claw hand door knob technique?\n\nOr Pablito's 3rd arm?\n\nThe little sisters running on the walls?\n\nAdd them in comments and I'll add them to the cartoon list of tensegrity from the books.\n\nTensegrity is merely the manipulation of *intent*, using physical movement.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Another Delusional Attack", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 94, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"b1txdjyzvxra1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 72, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b1txdjyzvxra1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=710fdec5afcfeea0289f037cbc3fddea780872a3"}, {"y": 145, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b1txdjyzvxra1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=110ac918943e8b75923fc895e2aba94f7485d591"}, {"y": 215, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b1txdjyzvxra1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8684ea242f6b08eb0f9b131d79510e00d8a8ed02"}, {"y": 430, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b1txdjyzvxra1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6941ae06d2b36af51784a894103ba24c6037471"}, {"y": 645, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b1txdjyzvxra1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=557f16ff42abddef2f2a61bc690e313b3dc97593"}, {"y": 725, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b1txdjyzvxra1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0623690063a527cefd4d32170a42f833dad6084e"}], "s": {"y": 1414, "x": 2104, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/b1txdjyzvxra1.jpg?width=2104&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8408a04a894ee0e2d9f70f93d629de09fd2b7005"}, "id": "b1txdjyzvxra1"}}, "name": "t3_12bisk0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/LypsS4zwntaZyPSL_CICrNNaXBdXaxfGjd7EWVWdNeU.jpg", "edited": 1680645399.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1680614009.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/b1txdjyzvxra1.jpg?width=2104&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8408a04a894ee0e2d9f70f93d629de09fd2b7005\"&gt;Just so you know what&amp;#39;s being mentioned in here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone posted this, but their account was brand new.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be a Kachora person.

He seemed to be looking past me. He casually tapped the floor with the tip of his right foot, just behind his left heel. His legs were slightly arched; his arms were limp against his sides. Then he lifted his-right arm; his hand was open with the palm turned perpendicular to the ground; his fingers were extended and pointing toward me.

It consisted of pushing the diaphragm down while taking four sharp gasps of air through the mouth followed by four deep inhalations and exhalations through the nose.\n\nHe had explained that the gasps of air had to be felt as jolts in the middle part of the body, and that keeping the hands tightly clasped covering the navel gave strength to the midsection, and helped to control the gasps and the deep inhalations; which had to be held for a count of eight as one pressed the diaphragm down.

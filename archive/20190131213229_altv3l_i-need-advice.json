It's always at odds with the world, but that's just too much.  And so the very thing they claim is holding them down, holds them down only because of their own repetitious internal dialogue.\n\nIf you want to maintain \"the war\", work harder than anyone else.   That's all that really means (aside from you'll get trouble from normal people who think you've gone mad).\n\nBut some people have problems with the silence part of the techniques, if they haven't done a good recapitulation.  This is the main reason esoteric schools (Buddhist, Hindu, Daoist) have rules designed to protect the school from troublemakers.\n\nCarlos called these people \"cracked\".  It means they have some deep rooted issues, or even a bio-chemical imbalance.    Those people really need to do a recapitulation before they try to activate the second attention.  So don't bypass that.  It's sort of like a self-psychoanalysis.  And if you get into silent states with the second attention activated, even the most subtle \"issue\" will come out and create problems. It'll also block your \"seeing\".\n\nPeople have written to me over the years.  I do my best to try to convince them to work harder, because that's all anyone is missing.  Carlos had so many students into which he poured endless hours.  Nearly all of them failed due to laziness.  They were waiting around for Carlos to enter their dreams and make everything good.  Or materialize a rabbit with Japanese glasses.\n\nThe people waiting around for a father figure to make it all good either fade out, saying their spouse won't let them practice as much as they need, or they just outright admit it's too much work once they figure out how much time it takes to make real progress. They go back to a Guru offered method where it's been adjusted to maximize the customer base, by making it easier to do.  It's not more effective, it just falls within the laziness range of the average person.\n\nA classic example is TM from the Beetles. (TM + Carlos Castaneda = majority of 1960s hippy philosophy).\n\nNow Chopra teaches it.  It's a lovely technique. Just one simple and not too ostentatious mantra for everyone, no one says it out loud while sitting cross-legged on a mountain top showing how holy they are, and you only have to do it 20 minutes, twice a day.  I highly recommend it as a backup technique when you're having trouble getting silent, from too much bodily pain. TM can produce bliss, and that makes it easier to activate the second attention.  Of course, I think they charge an obscene amount to teach it, unfortunately.   But there's other forms of mantric meditation available for free (I hope).\n\nOf course, the mantra just interrupts the internal dialogue, so that the assemblage point shifts. Then they load you up with their \"intent\", telling stories about supernatural beings in the Hindu hierarchy of heaven.  As a result, when the assemblage point shifts, that's how  you tend to interpret it.    If a Daoist had taught you, you'd see the Daoist hierarchy of heaven.\n\nBut you won't get anywhere with 40 minutes a day of practice.  You're behaving \"normally\" 16 hours a day.  40 minutes isn't going to compete.  I'd say you need a solid 3 hours a day of carefully selected practice to get anywhere.", "edited": 1549045568.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_efjacqg", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe the fliers exist.

Or materialize a rabbit with Japanese glasses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people waiting around for a father figure to make it all good either fade out, saying their spouse won&amp;#39;t let them practice as much as they need, or they just outright admit it&amp;#39;s too much work once they figure out how much time it takes to make real progress. They go back to a Guru offered method where it&amp;#39;s been adjusted to maximize the customer base, by making it easier to do.  It&amp;#39;s not more effective, it just falls within the laziness range of the average person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A classic example is TM from the Beetles. (TM + Carlos Castaneda = majority of 1960s hippy philosophy).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now Chopra teaches it.  It&amp;#39;s a lovely technique. Just one simple and not too ostentatious mantra for everyone, no one says it out loud while sitting cross-legged on a mountain top showing how holy they are, and you only have to do it 20 minutes, twice a day.  I highly recommend it as a backup technique when you&amp;#39;re having trouble getting silent, from too much bodily pain. TM can produce bliss, and that makes it easier to activate the second attention.  Of course, I think they charge an obscene amount to teach it, unfortunately.   But there&amp;#39;s other forms of mantric meditation available for free (I hope).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, the mantra just interrupts the internal dialogue, so that the assemblage point shifts. Then they load you up with their &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;, telling stories about supernatural beings in the Hindu hierarchy of heaven.  As a result, when the assemblage point shifts, that&amp;#39;s how  you tend to interpret it.    If a Daoist had taught you, you&amp;#39;d see the Daoist hierarchy of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you won&amp;#39;t get anywhere with 40 minutes a day of practice.  You&amp;#39;re behaving &amp;quot;normally&amp;quot; 16 hours a day.  40 minutes isn&amp;#39;t going to compete.  I&amp;#39;d say you need a solid 3 hours a day of carefully selected practice to get anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_altv3l", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/altv3l/i_need_advice/efjacqg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1549044010.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1549044010.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "efhqbfi", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_efh29ae", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "I take your advice.

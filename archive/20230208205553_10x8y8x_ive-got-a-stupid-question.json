*The Active Side of Infinity* has this passage:\n\nA new mood took over. I was alone! Don Juan had left me inside a dream as his agent provocateur. I felt my body begin to lose its rigidity; it became flexible, by degrees, until I could breathe deeply and freely. I laughed out loud. I didn't care that people were staring at me and weren't smiling this time. I was alone, and there was nothing I could have done about it! \n\nI had the physical sensation of actually entering into a passageway, a passageway that had a force of its own. It pulled me in. It was a silent passageway. Don Juan was that passageway, quiet and immense. This was the first time ever that I felt that don Juan was void of physicality. There was no room for sentimentality or longing. I couldn't possibly have missed him because he was there as a depersonalized emotion that lured me in.\n\nThe passageway challenged me. I had a sensation of ebullience, ease. Yes, I could travel that passageway, alone or in company, perhaps forever. And to do this was not an imposition for me, nor was it a pleasure. It was more than the beginning of the *definitive journey,* the unavoidable fate of a warrior-traveler, it was the beginning of a new era. I should have been weeping with the realization that I had found that passageway, but I wasn't. I was facing *infinity* at Ship's! How extraordinary! I felt a chill on my back. I heard don Juan's voice saying that the universe was indeed unfathomable. \n\nAt that moment, the back door of the restaurant, the one that led to the parking lot, opened and a strange character entered: a man perhaps in his early forties, disheveled and emaciated, but with rather handsome features. I had seen him for years roaming around UCLA, mingling with the students. Someone had told me that he was an outpatient of the nearby Veterans' Hospital. He seemed to be mentally unbalanced. I had seen him time after time at Ship's, huddled over a cup of coffee, always at the same end of the counter. I had also seen how he waited outside, looking through the window, watching for his favorite stool to become vacant if someone was sitting there. \n\nWhen he entered the restaurant, he sat at his usual place, and then he looked at me. Our eyes met. The next thing I knew, he had let out a formidable scream that chilled me, and everyone present, to the bone. Everyone looked at me, wide-eyed, some of them with unchewed food in their mouths. Obviously, they thought I had screamed. I had set up the precedents by banging the counter and then laughing out loud. The man jumped off his stool and ran out of the restaurant, turning back to stare at me while, with his hands, he made agitated gestures over his head.\n\nI succumbed to an impulsive urge and ran after the man. I wanted him to tell me what he had seen in me that had made him scream. I overtook him in the parking lot and asked him to tell me why he had screamed. He covered his eyes and screamed again, even louder. He was like a child, frightened by a nightmare, screaming at the top of his lungs. I left him and went back to the restaurant.\n\n\"What happened to you, dear?\" the waitress asked with a concerned look. \"I thought you ran out on me.\" \n\n\"I just went to see a friend,\" I said. \n\nThe waitress looked at me and made a gesture of mock annoyance and surprise. \n\n\"Is that guy your friend?\" she asked. \n\n\"The only friend I have in the world,\" I said, and that was the truth, if I could define \"friend\" as someone who sees through the veneer that covers you and knows where you really come from.", "edited": 1675888990.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j7r2xl8", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very end of &lt;em&gt;The Active Side of Infinity&lt;/em&gt; has this passage:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A new mood took over.

I had also seen how he waited outside, looking through the window, watching for his favorite stool to become vacant if someone was sitting there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he entered the restaurant, he sat at his usual place, and then he looked at me. Our eyes met. The next thing I knew, he had let out a formidable scream that chilled me, and everyone present, to the bone. Everyone looked at me, wide-eyed, some of them with unchewed food in their mouths. Obviously, they thought I had screamed. I had set up the precedents by banging the counter and then laughing out loud. The man jumped off his stool and ran out of the restaurant, turning back to stare at me while, with his hands, he made agitated gestures over his head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I succumbed to an impulsive urge and ran after the man. I wanted him to tell me what he had seen in me that had made him scream. I overtook him in the parking lot and asked him to tell me why he had screamed. He covered his eyes and screamed again, even louder. He was like a child, frightened by a nightmare, screaming at the top of his lungs. I left him and went back to the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What happened to you, dear?&amp;quot; the waitress asked with a concerned look. &amp;quot;I thought you ran out on me.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I just went to see a friend,&amp;quot; I said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The waitress looked at me and made a gesture of mock annoyance and surprise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that guy your friend?&amp;quot; she asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The only friend I have in the world,&amp;quot; I said, and that was the truth, if I could define &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; as someone who sees through the veneer that covers you and knows where you really come from.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10x8y8x/ive_got_a_stupid_question/j7r2xl8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1675888183.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_10x8y8x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 13}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 6, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_10x8y8x", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_10x8y8x", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_10x8y8x", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j7s0uat", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j7ryl75", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "It's in the books.\n\nBasically if your dad and mom were very excited about sex, then you get a heavy dose of \"awareness\" at conception, and grow to have enough extra dreaming energy, to do what you like with sex.\n\nIf they were bored, you weren't given enough energy to be able to afford to expend it, making babies.

Here he is!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she turned the cellphone around, to shoot it at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She continued, &amp;quot;Notice the stupid white bag he always carries, to hold his stolen things...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess that might not imply she&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;proving&amp;quot; magic to anyone, but a few days later she was playing back one of those blogs, and I heard,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;NO.  STOP IT!  I&amp;#39;m not trying to move that.  Don&amp;#39;t interfere with me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was talking to Minx.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What would be really cool is, if Cholita had witches out there she was teaching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;d have to spy on her to find out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she&amp;#39;d never trust me again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_10x8y8x", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10x8y8x/ive_got_a_stupid_question/j7rm9tp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1675895407.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1675895407.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j7rbdk2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j7rabm8", "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10x8y8x/ive_got_a_stupid_question/j7rbdk2/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_j7rbdk2", "created": 1675891277.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1675891277.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j7zjnto", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j7xdrfy", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It's reported all the time!\n\nPeople just gloss over it.\n\nI've even seen youtube videos that were VERY convincing.

It \"just works out\".\n\nAnd you don't have to theorize that you've passed out,  or went to bed!\n\nIt's just not possible most of the time, because you take a running leap to leave the room through the solid wall.  You'd bump your head, if you tried to blank out and go to sleep.\n\nHalfway through the leap I've changed my mind before, to go get some water first.\n\nIn case where I'm going has none.\n\nAnd turned on the lights.

You just go outside in your new form, and pick up the car with one hand.\n\nOr chase cats depending on the form you changed into.\n\nThere's absolutely no indication it isn't real, except for the fact that no one is around.\n\nExcept the poor cats.\n\nCats don't do well in my neighborhood. Cholita even cursed one, which was subsequently killed in a freakish but somewhat humorous accident involving a huge truck speeding through a residential neighborhood.\n\nThe neighbors couldn't figure out whether to cry, or chuckle.\n\nThe cat pissed off Cholita...\n\nBut questioning if things are \"real\", or somehow imaginary isn't anything new.\n\nIf you read the books of Carlos.\n\nThat sort of unresolved question often comes up in the story line.\n\nThey do something incredibly magical in one of the stories from the books, Carlos with La Gorda for example, and when it's over they're back where they started. Even though the magic involved opening a portal to escape the room.\n\nOr while they're doing the magic, all the other people who might see them doing it mysteriously disappear.  And reappear when they're done.\n\nAnd don't overlook that shared dreaming takes place during some of this!\n\nTwo people.  Not one.\n\nI chase Cholita across continents.\n\nOk...\n\nI'll admit it. She crosses continents.\n\nI give up and go back to my darkroom when it's clear I can never keep up with younger (slimmer) Cholita, and realize I've gone so far outside my darkroom it's obvious I walked through 2 solid walls on the way.\n\nSo I go remote view \"chase\" her on the bed, and try to grab her with my hand and pull her out of her dream, into my darkoom.\n\nIf I catch her slacking off.\n\nMe awake, her in her dreaming double.\n\nAnd I certainly can't explain that,  later on.\n\nBut there is a key to it, in that shared dreaming version.\n\nWhich you would already know, if you had read the books.\n\nOur \"double\" lives in a multiverse.  He's the one who runs around in dreams, believing he's you.\n\nAnd he's not limited to this reality.\n\nI suppose you could say, for every reality we can perceive there are 20,000 \"copies\" of it, in alternate universes.\n\nSo meeting in your physical body, with a witch in her double, requires you both to \"tune in the same copy of reality.\n\nOne of the witches in here can almost travel to my darkroom, but doesn't seem to be able to \"tune in\" my copy of reality. And I can't tune in hers enough to \"grab\" her, so that she's forced to wake up.\n\n6000 miles from home, I might add.  Cholita will drive her home in a rented fishing boat, if we succeed. Just to cement in the fact that it's a very long distance to travel in a few seconds.\n\nPlus Cholita might like being a \"skipper\".\n\nSo I have to be satisfied to only watch that witch,  who is able to travel all the way to my darkroom,  just walk right by me as if I'm not there.  I'm not sure she even knows how close she got.\n\nPerhaps what you're really asking is, if you can break the laws of THIS reality?\n\nThis specific one, that we all share together.\n\nWell, Cholita can!\n\nShe levitates small objects.  2 ounces or less, unless there's some water involved somewhere.\n\nThen she can do a lot more.\n\nShe'll move objects on the table with other people around, as long as no one is watching.\n\nYou can see her move something to the far side of a table, and then a waitress comes and picks it up from there.\n\nAnd my Ally \"Fairy\" used to make water flow sideways in the shower, when she wanted to get my attention.\n\nSo make up your mind.  Do you want to see real magic?\n\nOr do you have some goal to \"prove\" it to others, so you can cash in on it?\n\nIf that's the case, learning it will be impossible for you.\n\nNot because the \"magic gods\" will be offended.\n\nThey don't care!  Go ahead and prank your friends with magic.\n\nBUT, it's so much effort to learn it, that if what you seek is attention or fame from humans, you'll give up and find another way to get attention.\n\nIt's too much work, for the small amount of attention you can get from other people. Who won't believe you anyway. And will from then on, make fun of you behind your back.\n\nOtherwise,  if it's not a desire to \"cash in\", I can't figure why anyone would care about what you're asking.\n\nDid anyone question \"The Buddha\" who couldn't even open his eyes while doing his \"magic\"?\n\nDo they insist a Yogi prove his \"Astral plane world\" is real?\n\nHow come we have to prove stuff, when we kick their miserable asses?\n\nBut they don't???\n\nAnyway, the answer is, \"It depends.\"\n\nOn what, we don't know.", "edited": 1675891853.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j7rabm8", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one still available to us knows.

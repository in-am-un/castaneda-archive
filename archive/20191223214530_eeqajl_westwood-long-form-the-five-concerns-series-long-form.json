Is that for all the women he\u2019s taken in, who can\u2019t seem to run their own lives?\"\n\nYea, I was a bastard.\n\nMaybe I was right, but you shouldn't actually think things like that.\n\nAnd no, that\u2019s not it at all!\n\nAs he said, we\u2019ve given off decision making to the social order.  All decisions. Even very tiny ones.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to that than meets the eye.\n\nLet\u2019s say for example, you follow don Juan's  advice and ditch your family.\n\nMaybe one of the relatives will put another of the relatives up to,  trying to get you to come back.\n\nTypically, a Mom likes her collection of pets.  If she can\u2019t control them and one runs away, she\u2019ll send the fastest running son to fetch them and bring them back.\n\nNot being allowed to club you on the head and drag you home, like in olden times, he\u2019ll use agreements we never made ourselves, to guilt trip you.\n\nAnd it\u2019ll work! You won't even realize, \"Hey, I never agreed to this!\"\n\nWe have in fact allowed those agreements we never made, to fill our consciousness.\n\nWhy should you care?\n\nYou can\u2019t assemble another world if those are pulling on your assemblage point.\n\nYou can add, \u201cMy poor grey haired mother will suffer if I assemble this other world and don\u2019t come back\u201d, to the list of sorcery blockages.\n\nAlong with \u201cGod will hate me for learning to be silent. He made us the way we need to be.\"\n\nI guess I was too Stormtrooperish for Carlos.\n\nWhen he talked about not being able to make decisions, I was thinking, Oh yea!!!!???\n\nWho you talking about?\n\nBut he was right about us needing to restore our \u201cdecision making\u201d capability.\n\nAfter 2 hours of making sure I was in heightened awareness (the pitch black dark room gets really weird), I tried the moves.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was, there is indeed a \u201ccenter\u201d there.\n\nI hadn\u2019t noticed the idea of energy vortexes before.\n\nI\u2019d witnessed the second attention's vortex. It\u2019s assemblage point.\n\nIt sucks energy in to some extent. If you deposit a puff of energy near it, it sort of falls into there.\n\nIf you deposit a puff of energy (purple light) on your leg, it just sits there. So you can smear it and have super purple legs.\n\nThe vortex at the V spot is also, in fact a filter!\n\nCarlos wrote that this particular vortex had a \"watery look\", and it also filtered incoming energy, to extract only the watery kind.\n\nI guess the watery kind is easier to use in making a decision???\n\nWe're really that mechanical?\n\nShit.\n\nCarlos! Wow.\n\nUsing the simple scooping action move, in slow motion, normal speed, this angle, that angle, I found out that purple puffs of very bright color, when deposited there, are ripped apart, revealing a yellow color that\u2019s the exact size as the purple.\n\nNot fast, it's slow. But still, I can see the purple being slid off the yellow.  When I've seen yellow under purple in the past, it was revealed by a swirling motion on the puff of light itself, absent any contact with my body.\n\nThe purple is sucked in, the yellow drifts and dissipates.   It could contain shades of green too.\n\nOr vice-versa. It gets too close to my chest, to see who got sucked in, and who drifted away.\n\nIt's the only tensegrity move I've noticed, which seems to split energy.\n\nI'll have to look closer, but that was a first for me.\n\nI also felt the main benefit of Tensegrity, if you can\u2019t *see*.\n\nSince I hadn\u2019t done those movements for 23 years, there was plenty of energy to release on the first tries. And my assemblage point was flexible, and I was fully silent.\n\nSo the effect is easy to feel.\n\nJust doing the first 3 mentioned in his book, I had that rush of good feeling you get from continuous exercise, when you can stop and relax.\n\nThe \"exercise high\".\n\nIt\u2019s actually quite a strong high.\n\nBut unfortunately, it won\u2019t be enough to get Tensegrity only practitioners on the right track to find heightened awareness.\n\nCholita mentioned that \"feeling very high\" was the main effect of Tensegrity, for her.\n\nBut it\u2019s just not that different than the yoga high, or the joggers high.\n\nOnly the amount of effort to get it being so far less than normal, might clue you in.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not true after you\u2019ve done a few and redeployed most of that energy.\n\nI believe Carlos had this plan:  Groups doing tensegrity would restore energy centers, build up that exercise high, be impeccable so that they slowly made the right decisions to become sorcerers, and then their assemblage points would finally cross a threshold, and they'd *see*.\n\nAs Cholita explained, if you are an impeccable warrior, \"all of your decisions will be correct.\"\n\nShe repeated the plan, as conveyed to her by the witches.\n\nBut instead, the tensegrity practitioners became something else, after Carlos was gone.\n\nI'm not sure what yet.\n\nBut there are indications, they're none too happy with me.\n\nIf a stalking specialist came along and put me to shame, I'd rejoice!\n\nNot good that this isn't happening with a dreaming specialist or two, helping out some tensegrity practitioners.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1577407699.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fc4540s", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s a report on the decision-making V spot moves, from this Westwood list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried 1-7 as listed here, after finding them in Carlos&amp;#39; Tensegrity book also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn\u2019t read that far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About decision making.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounded stupid to me at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was thinking, &amp;quot;What?

And my assemblage point was flexible, and I was fully silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the effect is easy to feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just doing the first 3 mentioned in his book, I had that rush of good feeling you get from continuous exercise, when you can stop and relax.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;exercise high&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s actually quite a strong high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately, it won\u2019t be enough to get Tensegrity only practitioners on the right track to find heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita mentioned that &amp;quot;feeling very high&amp;quot; was the main effect of Tensegrity, for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it\u2019s just not that different than the yoga high, or the joggers high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only the amount of effort to get it being so far less than normal, might clue you in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that\u2019s not true after you\u2019ve done a few and redeployed most of that energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Carlos had this plan:  Groups doing tensegrity would restore energy centers, build up that exercise high, be impeccable so that they slowly made the right decisions to become sorcerers, and then their assemblage points would finally cross a threshold, and they&amp;#39;d &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Cholita explained, if you are an impeccable warrior, &amp;quot;all of your decisions will be correct.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She repeated the plan, as conveyed to her by the witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But instead, the tensegrity practitioners became something else, after Carlos was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there are indications, they&amp;#39;re none too happy with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a stalking specialist came along and put me to shame, I&amp;#39;d rejoice!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not good that this isn&amp;#39;t happening with a dreaming specialist or two, helping out some tensegrity practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/eeqajl/westwood_long_form_the_five_concerns_series_long/fc4540s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1577406872.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_eeqajl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fbvqe8c", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1577134558.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_eeqajl", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Wow.\n\nI was there, but now it's so significant, I can't believe that at the time I thought it was just more random and probably pointless kungfu.\n\nWe'll need more than 10 dreamers to figure all this tensegrity out!\n\nI'd say, all this was in danger of being lost.\n\nCarlos tried his best.

Cholita ran away, and might end up committing suicide. She borrowed (stole if I stopped paying for it) a rental car, which is not good.\n\nI hope she just went scouting again, as usual. But there's no telling; she's been insisting she'll be dead soon.\n\nSo I'm out of it today.\n\nBut the warning I really had in mind is this.  I went online to view others doing the Westwood series on YouTube.\n\nDue to Cleargreen selling teacher certificates, Russia has a lot of online tensegrity demonstrations.\n\nAnd there could be other eastern European countries in that mix of videos I saw.\n\nI\u2019m not against Cleargreen selling teacher certificates. Carlos sort of did that! And it seems to have perpetuated Tensegrity.\n\nI have heard some disturbing reports of prejudice against some for not towing the party line, and so they might have been held back.\n\nThat's no good if you ask me.   But Carlos did that too.\n\nCertainly it makes me a black sheep among that group.\n\nIf that was all that was out there, I\u2019d be worried.  Sooner or later Tensegrity will end up on the trash heap, if it isn\u2019t a little more rewarding. But knowledge that you can do dreaming at the same time is rising. In that case, Tensegrity will stick around a long time.\n\nI\u2019d even say, we have 3 areas of interest here. Cleargreen is the Tensegrity group,  Cholita and I will contribute to teaching dreaming awake for a while, and sooner or later someone needs to come along and teach stalking.\n\nThe comments on the videos were filled with, \u201cYou made a mistake with the right hand\u2026  Better go back and read the books too.\u201d\n\nInventories! That\u2019s the warning. Don\u2019t turn Tensegrity into an inventory.\n\nThat\u2019s probably why Carlos never did what I\u2019m about to do here. I\u2019m sorry Carlos, but it\u2019s needed.  You had enemies.  I'm just fighting back against them.\n\nJust be sure not to add my analysis of this Tensegrity move to your existing inventory. That\u2019ll hold you back big time.\n\nThe goal is to be an \u201cexpert\u201d, only when there\u2019s really nothing else to seek. That\u2019s true of several esoteric doctrines, especially Taoism. Inventory is king in Taoism.\n\nThey were seers extraordinaire. But they compiled lists of what they saw, and future generations focused on the lists, instead of \u201cThe Tao\u201d.  Lists are more profitable than real knowledge.\n\nThat\u2019s caused a decline in Taoism.  It\u2019s ineffective for the most part.\n\nDon\u2019t get yourself into that mess.\n\nTensegrity does not need to be precise. The main point has to be there, or it\u2019s a different technique. But most of the time it doesn\u2019t matter which way your pinky finger is pointing.\n\nAnd you can even fart while doing Tensegrity. It\u2019s fine. Just make sure to scan your head slowly and smoothly to the right, after the fart, while exhaling somewhat forcefully, so as to pass the blame to the person standing there.\n\nI started around 3AM, got up, did mashing energy, and found the entire room now filled with patchy purple fog.\n\nAnd yes, I did see energy being mashed. Not as exciting as it sounds, but you can visually *see* that.\n\nCholita brought that dreaming fog to me. She\u2019s been gone several days, but it sticks around.\n\nYou probably won\u2019t be able to *see* the tensegrity, until you can at least see puffs of color in darkness.\n\nIt\u2019s probably not necessary to have a full fledged fog of purple light. But I have no idea if you could start from not seeing anything in darkness, never having learned that, and figure out what the Tensegrity moves do anyway.\n\nYou\u2019d still get the results, as described by Carlos. In this case, your assemblage point would in fact eventually drop down, by using this technique. It would just have to drop very far, before your dreaming attention might activate enough to *see* this pass. And if it did, and you saw something, you\u2019d likely \u201cdouble take\u201d it away.\n\nSo you\u2019d never learn to *see* it. If you doubt that, ask yourself why Cleargreen isn't writing stuff like this?\n\nTensegrity is best done while dreaming awake.  That's like having a nice bright light, when working on your car in the garage.  It's pretty hard to see what you're doing without it.\n\nThe purple fog was blank when I started. I could see a few fine lines in it, along with puffy clouds or bars which stretched at all angles, approximately 4 inches round, going from floor to ceiling.\n\nIt was a \u201cdreaming matrix\u201d, for intercepting other people\u2019s *intent*.\n\nThe very first time I tried this move, my hands visually penetrated the fog and caused the puffy purple to break into fine lines of amber and white. \n\nDe-emphasize the amber. I had to look hard to *see* that.  \n\nI got distracted. I started to think.\n\nSomething out there gave me the command to take an inventory. Maybe it was triggered by noticing the effect of the Tensegrity?\n\nJust speculation. Maybe the command to take an inventory is actually infinity verifying something it just witnessed?  As if it's saying, \"Hey, what was that???\"\n\nInstead of fussing about the upcoming holiday, the usual type of inventory modern humans might take, I took an inventory of the fog.\n\nA day before I\u2019d written, for no reason I could figure out, purple -&gt; teal -&gt; grey, and so on.\n\nAnother inventory.\n\nBut watching the purple, I saw that it was in fact true. I could *see* traces of several colors in the purple, and realized that depending on which you focused on you would *see* more of that.\n\nInventory done, I went back to the technique.\n\nThe second attempt produced a fuss of light, with a woman\u2019s face in the middle.  I couldn't tell if there was a dreaming scene behind it.  But definitely the fog had consolidated to form that head, and there were blank spaces around it.\n\nI stopped and turned around, and her head floated along with my body movement. It rose a few feet, and details of a dreaming scene started to form around her.\n\nI can\u2019t see my own assemblage point, so I don\u2019t know if it dropped down.\n\nBut in fact, when you practice silence or meditation, you often have a feeling something is dropping down, and it\u2019s often accompanied by a mini-dream.\n\nThis technique works as promised by Carlos.   I suspect that means, those categories of what the Westwood series movements are for, is not just a random inventory Carlos created to sell workshop tickets.\n\nProbably all of the rest of them do what they say, just like this technique.\n\nIt would take at least 3 types of seeing to verify that.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1577211531.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fby7yju", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried #27 from this list, \u201cEnticing The Assemblage Point To Drop Down\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wow!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But first let me warn everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, 2 warnings.

As if it&amp;#39;s saying, &amp;quot;Hey, what was that???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of fussing about the upcoming holiday, the usual type of inventory modern humans might take, I took an inventory of the fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A day before I\u2019d written, for no reason I could figure out, purple -&amp;gt; teal -&amp;gt; grey, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But watching the purple, I saw that it was in fact true. I could &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; traces of several colors in the purple, and realized that depending on which you focused on you would &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; more of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inventory done, I went back to the technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second attempt produced a fuss of light, with a woman\u2019s face in the middle.  I couldn&amp;#39;t tell if there was a dreaming scene behind it.  But definitely the fog had consolidated to form that head, and there were blank spaces around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped and turned around, and her head floated along with my body movement. It rose a few feet, and details of a dreaming scene started to form around her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t see my own assemblage point, so I don\u2019t know if it dropped down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, when you practice silence or meditation, you often have a feeling something is dropping down, and it\u2019s often accompanied by a mini-dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This technique works as promised by Carlos.   I suspect that means, those categories of what the Westwood series movements are for, is not just a random inventory Carlos created to sell workshop tickets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably all of the rest of them do what they say, just like this technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would take at least 3 types of seeing to verify that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/eeqajl/westwood_long_form_the_five_concerns_series_long/fby7yju/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1577210286.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_eeqajl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fc5zjuc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fc5axma", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I haven\u2019t verified it\u2019s still true, but the last time I looked it turns out I was out maneuvered. \n\nIt was rather skillful!\n\nI\u2019ll remember that witch.

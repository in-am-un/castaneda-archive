I got threatened with violence just this morning!  It's war out there.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIf you can manage to put in some work, between thinking about your next sorcery \"book deal\", you might learn to move your assemblage point. You'll soon discover that the J curve map is very accurate.\n\nCarlos gave it to us in a single lecture, during the month or two when he knew he was dying, and needed to do something for us.\n\nHe hadn't been able to find a new male leader. He'd tried with Tony, Howard, and the guy who studied Maria Sabina, who's name starts with P. I can never remember that!\n\nNone wanted the job, and so Carlos released some techniques we use now, to do the astounding things you see in the pictures here.\n\nHis plan worked! We got to the whitish light, where \"Seeing Energy on a Horizon\" takes place. And some to \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nBut unfortunately, that's nowhere near the end of the path, it's really just the start.\n\nRecently we've been exploring how to share inorganic beings. The topic comes up, because it's so obvious.\n\nLet's say Carlos meet's Little Smoke, then later Little Smoke is around La Gorda.\n\nThe IOBs have very few emanations in common with us, so their \"trick\" is to scare the hell out of us anyway they can, leaving you a tiny bit traumatized, and embedding those stray emanations we give off, from fright, inside their own \"bodies\". Meanwhile they interact with us using facial expressions or movements, embedding their own emanations inside us. It's like a body fluid swap... A big kiss hello, from a scary spirit.\n\nBut that's nothing sinister! That happens with humans all the time. It's why you do recapitulation. To get back those fibers of your own awareness, and to expel the ones that are foreign to you.\n\nSorcery is NOT multiple things. In the end, it's all just one single thing. And that one thing, causes all the rest of what we do. You'll see that, if you manage to get yourself to work hard.\n\nIn the case of the IOBs, it's not a good idea to get rid of those stray emanations they embed in us. They're like a \"string\" connecting you to the inorganic being.\n\nThe old seers went so far as to deactivate all emanations in themselves, which were not in common with their inorganic beings.\n\nIn that manner, a group of 4 escaped death at that big rock don Juan took Carlos to. So he could see them himself. There were 4 old seers, each with 3 allies. Still alive. Thousands of years old perhaps.\n\nThe few emanations you can activate with a visit from an inorganic being, remain active for quite a while. The glow of awareness continues.\n\nMy experience suggests it does in fact fade with time, and so if you have an Ally and neglect her, it becomes harder for her to materialize in our realm.\n\nBut from recapitulation, we know those embedded emanations can last a lifetime. And we follow \"the intent of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico\", so I guess we could assume, energetic connections can last at least 10,000 years.\n\nOr at least, the connection is pretty sturdy over long periods of time. In fact, you may still be connected to your childhood \"Monster under the bed\". You should give her a call some time!\n\nSo you end up with a thread connecting you, and your Ally.\n\nCarlos used the word \"thread\" on occasion, but since we're on the internet, I prefer \"string\".\n\nBack to our situation. There's Carlos with a string connecting him to Little Smoke, and along comes La Gorda. She has a string too.\n\nWith the IOB in the middle.\n\nWhat can you do with that? Can you share dreaming, or even travel to other worlds together?\n\nFortunately, there's at least 14 books by Carlos and the witches. They're FILLED with what we need, if we intend to use them as a map.\n\nIn the case of whether you can user your IOB for shared dreaming and travel, we have the case of Carlos and Carol Tiggs using the inorganic beings as a springboard into the second attention.\n\nDon Juan called it, \"Using awareness as a feature of the environment\".\n\nIf you keep going you'll realize, there are so many ways to do that, you can't really even list them all.\n\nBasically you just need your IOB around, visibly perhaps, when you go travel into the second attention.\n\nMy own Ally has materialized over a portal, similar to how Disney has the talking skull over the dark tunnel their Pirates of the Caribbean ride plummets into, at the start of the ride. The spirit of the dead pirate, gives the people entry to magical realms.\n\nIn my case, one night I was awake on pillows on the bed, saw a portal on my bedroom wall, my Ally was just above it, and I got an urge to leap inside.\n\nFully awake, eyes open, sober, I leaped through a solid wall into another world. And remained there, with the world fully stable, for hours. It was not a \"dream\", since at no time did I run the risk of losing lucidity. And in fact, I was awake the whole time!\n\nDon't expect to be able to explain that. It defies explaining. There is of course the \"academic\" explanation, but it's best to worry about that, once you can do this on a regular basis.\n\nSo one way to use awareness as a feature of the environment, is to convince your ally to decorate your darkroom.\n\nA magical Vase, a treasure chest filled with gems. They can do either, and don't really care. You can even get them to hang out above you, during recapitulation. That will give you entry to very old memories, which you can \"relive\".\n\nDon't feel silly for a completely absurd idea, for how to keep them around. If you can \"pull it off\", go for it! They don't judge.\n\nDon Juan wore Little Smoke like a red rag on his belt near his gourd, for years.  Or to be more accurate, with the completely absurd situation, Little Smoke was said to be contained in the gourd, and could be  unleashed by don Juan whenever he liked, giving the apprentices something to fear.  Meanwhile, the rag represented what could happen, when that type of dark energy magic was released.  It could bring even a rag to life!\n\nit was a mini version of \"Using awareness as a feature of the environment\".\n\nSo ladies, don't throw away that jewelry!  Cholita loves bangles.  When there's too many and most are black, is when I get worried the most.\n\nPretty much, we're like 3 year old girls throwing a tea party, to those 2 billion year old spirits.\n\nThey barely understand what we're chattering about.\n\nWhen one of the kids at the \"tea party\" pours them some \"tea\" from an empty cup, your inorganic being is going to smile after drinking some, and tell you it's the best tea in China!\n\nThey just want to be invited to the party. They know it's 3 year olds, but they won't hold that against you. 3 years old, 100 years old, there's not much difference to an entity that lives 5 billion years.\n\nYou could also convince your Ally to turn into a big Siberian Cat, and stick around. I've done that for a day or two.\n\nThe cat is a magical object, and gives you dark energy in a range of emanations we normally can't possibly enter.\n\nWitches call them, \"Familiar Spirits\".", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Using Awareness as a Feature of the Environment", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"a9bueabrndm81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 144, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a9bueabrndm81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=010407829699a2d70dda36b297047eddfeca3659"}, {"y": 289, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a9bueabrndm81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fa86741bc5bee1f42b0d2fb388ce1e49373e3df"}, {"y": 428, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a9bueabrndm81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a10ad8646de14dbf4e902f1261428eb1a4f6b20b"}, {"y": 857, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a9bueabrndm81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e03f9bff449f0ca1a4809a3e18dd20f72c261fb2"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 764, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a9bueabrndm81.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=561d387741ee119ea3333f719b11df6cc5411181"}, "id": "a9bueabrndm81"}}, "name": "t3_taagdo", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/aVGidw8KSUmx2ENht_Vuz9NNqAhrSYWTPjUp1ygbsc8.jpg", "edited": 1646842495.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1646840307.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/a9bueabrndm81.png?width=764&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=561d387741ee119ea3333f719b11df6cc5411181\"&gt;Couldn&amp;#39;t find a real pic, but anyone whos been there will recognize this.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Copied from Facebook, so that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s a bit hostile to the audience.

Just let it be if it&amp;#39;s that &amp;quot;stubborn&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You really can just wave your hand, to summon a remote view in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the HARD part is getting over there, and still having any energy left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once there, it&amp;#39;s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An analogy: In the red zone, you have only the 1 pound box of See&amp;#39;s candy (chocolates).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Silent Knowledge, you own the store.  So you aren&amp;#39;t picking around trying to find the last marshmallow chocolate candy when they all look pretty much alike  until you bite in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Silent Knowledge, you just keep doing what you do. Anything you did in the past that you wish you could repeat, floats by as an &amp;quot;offering&amp;quot; again.  Based on the fact that you were wanting it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was gazing at &amp;quot;next to nothing&amp;quot; last night, in Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, &amp;quot;Next to nothing&amp;quot; is precisely what you want to gaze at, when you first get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The nothing, turns out to contain somethings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flows of energy, that seem alive on their own.  Stuff  you could never notice before moving the assemblage point that far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you don&amp;#39;t get bored!  You simply &amp;quot;run out of energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps trying to repeat things, is a red zone prejudice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the red zone makes you &amp;quot;ambitious&amp;quot;, by it&amp;#39;s very nature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, there&amp;#39;s the unexplained pink zone...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_taagdo", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/taagdo/using_awareness_as_a_feature_of_the_environment/i00jmmt/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1646856589.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i004y8y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1646850873.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_taagdo", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "On you getting physical threats.\n\nThere's not very many men more angry than those who think another man is depriving them of an opportunity to get their d*ck wet.\n\nAnam on YouTube, and some of his India-heritage follower(s), are in this group.\n\nThis is where your idea of offering certification comes in.

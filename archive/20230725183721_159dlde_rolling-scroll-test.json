The diagram was drawn by Carlos at Cal State back in the 80s.\n\nI have to include it in my egg animation, because it seems to have angered the fake sorcery people. Who had some other vision of what the egg and the assemblage point were like.\n\nMaybe from frauds like Kachora, Miguel, Victor, or other \"old timer\" fakes I can't think of right now.  There's so many it's impossible to keep track.\n\nBut people in our community did find that the short amount of that egg clip animation ended up being \"discussed\" by bad men.\n\nWhich is a good sign. If it quotes from the books at every step of the way, and includes this diagram drawn by Carlos himself, with everything in the animation agreeing with everything written about this in the 17 books and publications created by Carlos and the witches, maybe it'll produce a positive change in our community.\n\nMaybe the fakes, will start teaching the real thing.\n\nThey still won't be able to do any of it.  But when I think back on it, many of my teachers in school couldn't do what they were teaching either.  But it still worked out, because they had good materials, and were encouraging.\n\nThe old saying about teachers?  \"Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.\"\n\nMight be true of sorcery also.  At least, post old seers with younglings, and post new seers with lineages.  What we have is \"potential mass\".  So the more who see the real thing and understand it better, the more likely it is that we'll get that energetic mass Carlos sought.  Where the glow of the awareness of so many people, makes it easier each year for new people to succeed.\n\nSo here's how I plan to introduce the egg diagram at the end, just to tamp down criticism by people who had a made up understanding.\n\nAs for Howard and Bruce Lee, I suppose they don't need to fight.  You can see the \"Super 8\" camera there, likely what they had to film the home movie Carlos mentioned in class, where he played the bartender.\n\nAnd there he is!\n\nAnd why a duck?\n\nTo introduce the duck joke Carlos told. He was explaining \"cognitive dissonance\" through what is apparently a classic joke.\n\n\"A man walks into a bar with a duck on his head.  The bartender asks...\"\n\nI'm afraid I don't recall!  And it turns out, there's several versions of the joke.\n\nChatGPT suggested, making a pun out of it. So I will.\n\nThe current plan is that at the end of the egg video, after showing the slice and how the assemblage point moves, and how the egg can stretch into a pipe shape, or an infinite line, TPW (tensegrity policewoman from the Dance Home cartoons coming up later) finds herself in the inorganic being's world, with an invite to the Dreaming Emissary.\n\nHey!!!!  It happens.  For real.\n\nAnd it gets far more weird than I could possibly animate.\n\nSorcery is not \"Saintly\". It's not rational, and it infuriates non-sorcerers to even hear about it.\n\nThey want to hear about the amazing Saint Bob, or Enoch, Or Buddha, or Lao Tzu.\n\nNone of whom actually existed as the story is told.\n\nBut one thing is for sure, their \"story\" is rational, and human, and warms the hearts of all who believe in it.\n\nSorcery is cold, and alien, and disturbing.\n\nBUT, you get to do REAL magic, instead of only \"believing\" that some saint somewhere, high up in Tibet, can do magic.\n\nBut no one can say they ever saw any for real.\n\nWith sorcery, YOU do the magic, EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.\n\nIn your face. Not with your eyes closed or after 5 grams of shrooms.\n\nIt's for real, wide awake, eyes open, with people walking through walls and flying through the air, just as don Juan told Taisha in her last book.\n\nI've seen it, so I can tell you it's true.\n\nBut it's not \"cozy\" and rational at all.\n\nAt the end of the video, TPW walks into that saloon and has to figure out which of the characters is actually the dreaming emissary.\n\nSo that turns into a technique you can all use.  A mostly forgotten one, given to us by Carlos.\n\nBut which works amazingly well.\n\nIs the scroll too cheesy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8eo9v5q25eb1.jpg?width=2231&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70a45db5557702c274e28d78e958eb363d638a8c", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Rolling Scroll Test", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Audiovisual"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 69, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"4yrwbehw25eb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/159dlde/asset/4yrwbehw25eb1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718050150%2CYmM4NWVkYjQ1ZWY1OWY1Y2IzNTdlOGQ1YmU4ZTk4OWFlMjFiMDU4ZmU4YTE2NDY1ZGNmNWRkZDljY2MwMzFlZA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 1920, "y": 1080, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/159dlde/asset/4yrwbehw25eb1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718050150%2CMjFkOThlYzg5M2M4M2U1ZDVlNjQ3MjI0ZmYwMjNkNTliOTQ2YjJmOWRhOTY5NTNhODI0MWQxMzBhNGIyYTcyZA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "4yrwbehw25eb1", "isGif": false}, "e8eo9v5q25eb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 53, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e8eo9v5q25eb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c593ef31bc84dc5e1e3d93a18b52dc40a7e38a3"}, {"y": 106, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e8eo9v5q25eb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36f7aa55017e5b7172c87c630a58c6c2cf22a391"}, {"y": 157, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e8eo9v5q25eb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1d2b17220421228680fd49554277abef8da8ac0"}, {"y": 315, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e8eo9v5q25eb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d78e04f4969195cc6c095d418d5da2ec8ee8f8e1"}, {"y": 473, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e8eo9v5q25eb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d22ca107e150f976b36e12e7869fba8f7f6e41dc"}, {"y": 532, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e8eo9v5q25eb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51f96b6773f57c13d97e173f2b394d32bf647766"}], "s": {"y": 1101, "x": 2231, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/e8eo9v5q25eb1.jpg?width=2231&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70a45db5557702c274e28d78e958eb363d638a8c"}, "id": "e8eo9v5q25eb1"}}, "name": "t3_159dlde", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Audiovisual", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/kdbnyEp2UDW9NKhY5Hb_nMRc5rKuTBVHdOzGMGdknY0.jpg", "edited": 1690304369.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1690303041.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/159dlde/video/4yrwbehw25eb1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/159dlde/video/4yrwbehw25eb1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just looking for feedback on this &amp;quot;Sacred Egg Scroll&amp;quot;.

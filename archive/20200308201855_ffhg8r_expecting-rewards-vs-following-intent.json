Intellectuals all, and well read on Esoteric matters.\n\nVery tall, and stiff. They\u2019d walk around being \u201csuperior\u201d to everyone else they saw, pondering their amazing impeccability.\n\nAnd how they don\u2019t expect rewards too. Everything Carlos wrote that could be pretended, instead of actually done, they did.\n\nBut what they really needed was to get to work. Learn to get silent, and get cool things to happen, so they had feedback showing they were on the right track.\n\nThe stiffest of them once told me, when I asked why he didn\u2019t just learn to get silent during all these years,\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have much luck with that.\u201d\n\nWhat?????\n\nThere\u2019s no luck involved in learning to be silent. You know where you\u2019re failing all along the way.\n\nSo if someone says they had no luck, that means, they never put in a serious effort.\n\nContrast that with a student I had long ago, who began to develop false memories, as a result of learning to be silent.\n\nThat person had a good excuse.\n\n\u201cNever had luck\u201d is not a good excuse.\n\nSo expect rewards, if you\u2019re stuck in the mud, getting nowhere.\n\nDon\u2019t sit around at Yogananda\u2019s Palace in the mountains near LA, park your butt on a pew, and never have any actual experiences for your entire life.\n\nThe monks there will be happy to accommodate you on not having anything happen. They\u2019ll even frown disapprovingly if you dare to mention something cool that you experienced.\n\nAnd after a few years of nothing, you should get angry and go find another pew to sit in.\n\nBut when it is bad to expect rewards?\n\nOnce you\u2019re able to get them!\n\nThat\u2019s the strangest thing. The truth is the opposite of what you\u2019d expect.\n\nIf you have nothing, expect rewards. If you have a lot, don\u2019t expect them.\n\nSo when gazing at colors in the darkness, if you can\u2019t find any, EXPECT to.\n\nInsist. Keep it up until you do.\n\nBut once you can see colors, DON\u2019T expect rewards.\n\nSorry for my recent use of caps. I got tired of the bold text look, there doesn\u2019t seem to be an underline, and italics is reserved.\n\nThe reason not to expect rewards once you can see colors is, expecting them will prevent them.\n\nInstead of letting the colors move your assemblage point, you\u2019ll be watching for that pretty little Fairy to show up.\n\nOr that magnificent dead person (Cholita\u2019s favorite).\n\nBoth of those are a hazard to me.  Lately I  concentrate on watching the light show from Tensegrity, since it seems to move the assemblage point 4 times faster than just scooping randomly.\n\nAnd it moves so fast that beings start to manifest around me.\n\nIf I pay attention to them, the movement stops there.\n\nIf I ignore them, it moves very far, and I find myself surrounded by the details of another world.\n\nExpecting rewards in that case, reduces how many you get.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another way expecting rewards can really suck.\n\nIf you\u2019re teaching someone.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough to get stuck teaching someone.\n\nIt\u2019s like being asked to baby sit a badly behaved 8 year old, who's going to curse you constantly if they don't get what they want.\n\nSo it\u2019s understandable that don Juan would tell Carlos,\n\n\u201cShut the heck up and stop demanding to be rewarded all the time, you lazy bastard. Can\u2019t you do anything on your own?\u201d\n\nBut the ugliest manifestation of expecting rewards, is when both the reward, and the appraisal of it\u2019s value, are all in the mind of the student.\n\nHe\u2019s gone off to la-la land, imaging how great he\u2019s going to be when he can do that magical thing.\n\nBut then, to keep up the fussy internal dialogue, he has to oppose himself at the same time.\n\nHe goes back and forth between imaging himself doing real magic, and some petty little voice in his head which says it\u2019s not good enough.\n\nMaybe he\u2019ll be humiliated because someone else will point out a flaw in his reward, and knock him off his greatness pedestal.\n\nWhat does that look like in the real world you ask?\n\nYou\u2019ll have to imagine this, but take my word for it, I do this nightly.\n\nYou\u2019re doing tensegrity in darkness, your assemblage point has moved very far, and you go to sit up on the bed.\n\nAt this point, you can look forward and see \u201cthe wall\u201d, which can produce stupendous effects.\n\nOr, you look around the room to see \u201cthe wall\u201d projected all around, and because it\u2019s surrounding you, you begin to see that you\u2019re actually somewhere else, as if someone has picked up your bed and deposited it on a strange planet.\n\nOr, sitting there in silence, trying to stop the world, you notice that if you just turn your head to the left, you\u2019re sucked into a vision.\n\nIt\u2019s as real as anything when you\u2019re in it. But to leave it, you only need turn your head back the other direction.\n\nAll this is while fully awake, with your eyes open. No dreams involved.\n\nNow here\u2019s where expecting rewards is a big mistake.\n\nYou start to worry, Yea, but is it real?\n\nWhat???\n\nWho besides Milarepa and the Buddha, have you heard doing things like that?\n\nIt\u2019s just not a thing people do. It\u2019s true there are web pages out there selling stuff, where crazy people make all kinds of claims, but when you read the claims, it\u2019s fairly obvious they actually aren\u2019t doing those things.\n\nSo it should be good enough that it EVER happens. You shouldn\u2019t be obsessing over whether you\u2019ll later be exposed as a delusional fraud.\n\nThat\u2019s the \u201cflier\u2019s mind\u201d. Doubt. Stop doing that thing you learned to do.  Maybe it\u2019s wrong.  Mommy won't love you anymore if you appear foolish!\n\nFight that!  Just take what you get, and as a not-doing, consider it \u201creal\u201d.\n\nLater on, you might get lucky and be able to verify if it was \u201creal\u201d.\n\nFor instance, a fourth of the time when Cholita shows up in her dreaming body, and I notice and can interact with her,  she leaves some information I can verify the next day.\n\nBut each time, I worry it\u2019s not really her.\n\nWhy?\n\nJust take what happens. That way, it\u2019ll develop further, until you can in fact verify it.\n\nIf you become fussy and doubtful, it\u2019ll be much harder to find her.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another thing going on here. Everything I mentioned above is about following intent.\n\nNoticing it, and letting it move your assemblage point.\n\nIf one person creates a dream vision, it\u2019s essentially just a phantom world.\n\nNo \u201cmeat\u201d in it.\n\nIf 2 people share the same view, there\u2019s more meat in it.\n\nThe power of 2 makes the road a little clearer to follow.\n\nWhen it\u2019s just one person\u2019s intent, or just a faint trace of someone else\u2019s intent from long ago, it\u2019s like a path in the forest that\u2019s hundreds of years old, and very difficult to follow.\n\nAs you try to follow that path, you might stray to the left or right of it. Even go off in the entirely wrong direction.\n\nBut you\u2019re still taking a lovely stroll in the woods!  There\u2019s plenty to see.\n\nDon\u2019t worry if it\u2019s \u201cmeaningful\u201d.\n\nJust enjoy it.\n\nOver time, you\u2019ll get better at seeing that trail, until you are absolutely sure you\u2019re following that particular ancient road.\n\nI don't know if that makes it more meaningful, but it certainly makes it very good practice.\n\nThat\u2019s navigating.  Finding and losing the road.\n\nNot judging and evaluating the road's worth.\n\nEdited to correct major mistakes.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Expecting Rewards Vs.

Plus the humor just makes it all come together beautifully!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ffhg8r/expecting_rewards_vs_following_intent/fjzc78k/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1583716301.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ffhg8r", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fk7sfvi", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fk6tn7l", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It's a real bastard, isn't it?\n\nWhen people argue against the existence of magic, or insist their impotent meditation system is the ultimate, they're really defending their miserable internal dialogue.\n\nThey're wallowing in the river of filth with everyone else, arguing with someone on the shore who wants to help them out.\n\nThe worst part about this is the false narratives we create, to justify our suffering.\n\nThe family unit is one of them.

She draws blood.\n\nThe claw is pure insistence (will+anger).\n\nIt's really just \"tickling the web\", but with finger cramps and an attitude.\n\nGood call on not gazing into that too much. You will pass out when such things are very strong, and you're not used to it.\n\nSo here's what I've learned lately.  When playing with the colors, whatever you can do to make them more \"real\" will speed up moving the assemblage point.\n\nInstead of repeating myself, I\u2019ll summarize it.\n\nBy level of realness, and thus how quickly it will move the assemblage point, if you stop thinking at the same time:\n\n1. See puffs (lines are another story).\n\n2. Put hand next to a puff, and while turning the head, scoop it down to your kidney or liver.\n3. Scoop a puff and compress it with hands, like it was a ball of dough.  This one is Carlos recommended.\n4. Dough sticks to hand!  It\u2019s now independent.  Smear it on your legs and rub to increase the glow.\n5. A random puff has 2 eyes and a mouth.  If you recognize that, an echo will come next, with a full face. Typically, the face looks sort of puzzled, like, \u201cYou can *see* me???\u201d\n6. Play with the floating head until it can stand up on your bed.  Or get naked. Whichever is more interesting is ok.  Just don't tell the Pope.  I'm live broadcasting him right now, and he's kind of a stick in the mud.\n7. Do a little mashing energy on the floor with your feet, until you can see the results as colors or lines.\n8. Do a repetitive tensegrity move, until you figure out \u201cwhat it does\u201d.  For instance, V-spot scooping forms an energy mirror in front of me, into which I can gaze.  And someone gazes back!\n9. Find the lines. Those come after a while of looking at colors. Check floor, bed, wall. A line of vague white or yellow light, will have an echo of blackness, so that they cancel each other out.  Look for that effect.\n10. Surround yourself with the lines.  A new world will materialize all around you.  You typically cannot enter that way, the world will recede and you\u2019ll hit the wall. UNLESS, it\u2019s an inorganic beings realm. They\u2019ll help you pass.\n\nMy guess: This path isn\u2019t good for everyone.  A sign might be, the simple silence technique doesn\u2019t go as I wrote.\nI don\u2019t know why.   But it\u2019s got to work at least 60% of the time.\n\nIf it never works for you (and you weren't just a lazy bastard) switch to the recap.  \n\nWe all understand the recap, but here\u2019s the flashier things that can happen so you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a boring path.  These are what happened to me, that I can recall off the top of my head.

She draws blood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The claw is pure insistence (will+anger).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really just &amp;quot;tickling the web&amp;quot;, but with finger cramps and an attitude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good call on not gazing into that too much. You will pass out when such things are very strong, and you&amp;#39;re not used to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve learned lately.  When playing with the colors, whatever you can do to make them more &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; will speed up moving the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of repeating myself, I\u2019ll summarize it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By level of realness, and thus how quickly it will move the assemblage point, if you stop thinking at the same time:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;See puffs (lines are another story).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put hand next to a puff, and while turning the head, scoop it down to your kidney or liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scoop a puff and compress it with hands, like it was a ball of dough.  This one is Carlos recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dough sticks to hand!  It\u2019s now independent.  Smear it on your legs and rub to increase the glow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A random puff has 2 eyes and a mouth.  If you recognize that, an echo will come next, with a full face. Typically, the face looks sort of puzzled, like, \u201cYou can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; me???\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play with the floating head until it can stand up on your bed.  Or get naked. Whichever is more interesting is ok.  Just don&amp;#39;t tell the Pope.  I&amp;#39;m live broadcasting him right now, and he&amp;#39;s kind of a stick in the mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do a little mashing energy on the floor with your feet, until you can see the results as colors or lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do a repetitive tensegrity move, until you figure out \u201cwhat it does\u201d.  For instance, V-spot scooping forms an energy mirror in front of me, into which I can gaze.  And someone gazes back!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the lines. Those come after a while of looking at colors. Check floor, bed, wall. A line of vague white or yellow light, will have an echo of blackness, so that they cancel each other out.  Look for that effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surround yourself with the lines.  A new world will materialize all around you.  You typically cannot enter that way, the world will recede and you\u2019ll hit the wall. UNLESS, it\u2019s an inorganic beings realm. They\u2019ll help you pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess: This path isn\u2019t good for everyone.  A sign might be, the simple silence technique doesn\u2019t go as I wrote.\nI don\u2019t know why.   But it\u2019s got to work at least 60% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it never works for you (and you weren&amp;#39;t just a lazy bastard) switch to the recap.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all understand the recap, but here\u2019s the flashier things that can happen so you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a boring path.  These are what happened to me, that I can recall off the top of my head. Recap can:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Teach you what it feels like when the second attention is activated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Open tunnels of light to other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cause your body to help you out with movements you didn\u2019t do.

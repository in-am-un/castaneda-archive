At the level of &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. DoubleTake hates that shit!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;ll make your eyes blink rapidly, perhaps 3 times, to make it go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And give you a jolt of fear, to push your assemblage point at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now confused by having blinked, and the sight gone because Mr. DoubleTake scared your assemblage point back, you&amp;#39;ll forget you even noticed those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve already done that!  Constantly. We always see those emanations.  We just block them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you can see the lines mixed with the blobs of light, stop doing the pass, put the fingers there, and wiggle them (or pretend to be playing a harp), and &amp;quot;brush&amp;quot; them with the wiggling motion, closer to the point 1.5 feet out, and 4 inches to the right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do it right, you&amp;#39;ll start to feel more and more cobwebs, which are &amp;quot;thick as water&amp;quot; as Zuleica put it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, they offer noticeable resistance, but you can pass through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also &amp;quot;detect&amp;quot; patches of heat in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And stimulating it can cause blue blobs or white/red/blue/yellow intense dots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how you could learn to use those tentacles, but this technique also includes trying to sweep the floor with one of those tentacles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you develop one, you can literally touch things with it, and your Tonal will re-interpret that as your actual hand or foot having touched it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, it will feel EXACTLY like your hand, or your foot, touched the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When that&amp;#39;s not possible because there&amp;#39;s a bed under you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you&amp;#39;re too far away to touch it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trust me when I say, if you verify something from Carlos&amp;#39; books which sounds as wacky as that, it&amp;#39;s a huge boost to the ego.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t trying to be Saints!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s ok to be proud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And verifying something totally stupid from Carlos&amp;#39; books, something critics have used to slander him, is really cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you touch the floor with a tentacle, you even get a mini-vision of that part of the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if, it&amp;#39;s really the dreaming body doing that.  And it put it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;eyes&amp;quot; down there when it touched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe, it illuminated the emanations there, and that&amp;#39;s all you really need in order to &amp;quot;perceive&amp;quot; them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot more comes from that technique, which is probably why Carlos taught it first, in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First day I walked in, he taught me that. And stood there right next to me, grinning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if he knew I&amp;#39;d be here some day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, as a bitter grumpy old man, I can&amp;#39;t resist pointing out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of the sources you sited, Chinese or otherwise, has a teacher on this earth right now who is actually capable of doing what they claim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nor do they even have one who would believe you, if you managed to make their techniques work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the world of endless folly out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get too inspired by it&amp;#39;s products for sale.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Demand results!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hnhueq/omphaloskepsis/fxc10tz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1594229797.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_hnhueq", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_hnhueq", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fxc3azw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1594230854.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fxc0lyp", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "They're probably all compatible, since everyone is using the same body.\n\nAll meditation systems work exactly the same way: They interrupt the internal dialogue.\n\nThen you start to perceive reality at a deeper level.\n\nBut the problem is, the me-too naguals like Miguel, add on nutty things like, \"The 4 agreements\", in order to pacify and bewilder purchasers of their books.\n\nThe good stuff is soon buried under 10 layers of nonsense from people who couldn't actually do what the original esoteric technology specified.\n\nAs for the top of the head, yes, the second attention (double) comes out there!\n\nIt really does!\n\nNot always though.

That's the whole point.\n\nIt does sound a little like an intent delay, but only because the duration is in the ballpark of some of those.\n\nCould be, the assumption is backwards. The physical body seems to have that delay, because intent has a delay.\n\nIn other words, sorcery is more fundamental than science.  Science only exists \"up here\".\n\nCarlos tried to explain that in the introduction to one of his last books. That Causality was a blue zone illusion.  Physics is only valid at this position of the assemblage point.\n\nI see that nightly these days!  I have an \"embarrassment of riches\" lately.\n\nOf course a scientist would say, well show someone.  If you can lay flat on the air 2 feet above the floor, like it was a bed, then show us!\n\nCholita taught me that trick...\n\nBut you have to be at that distant position of the assemblage point to perceive it.\n\nNot only are they incapable of perceiving it, but they'll tug on your own assemblage point, and prevent it.\n\nIt's a vicious loop. For narrow minded \"scientists\" (which makes them not one), it's only valid \"up here\".  Anything \"down there\" is not real.\n\nSo they've divided our perception into \"allowed\" and \"not allowed\".\n\nThen there's manifesting objects.\n\nYou can do that rapidly.  If manifested objects were delayed pseudo visual stimuli, you'd have to have a \"pipe\".\n\nYou think, \"Hamburger\" and 15 seconds later you get a hamburger?\n\nThat's no fun!\n\nYou won't even remember that long, surrounded by Fairies and Dragons.  Sometimes 5 seconds is the maximum you can recall something, that far out.\n\nTruth is, you can reach behind the bed and pull an \"object\" out instantly.  And you'll be expecting it to fail, because it's so absurd.\n\nBut it works anyway, in the deep orange zone.\n\nEven if that had a \"secret 15 second mental delay\" on it, the next one comes out as fast as you like.\n\nSo you'd have to stack them up ahead of time, to give the illusion of coming rapidly. Which they do.\n\nHow deep is that stack?  Can  you only manifest 4 rapidly, and then you experience delays?\n\nWas it designed to hold 256 manifested objects?  Most of my computer designs use that deep of a pipe.\n\nI'm talking as an engineer here.  If you want to get mechanical with medical studies, then carry the analogy forward.\n\nHow come you can manifest objects, one after the other?  Shouldn't it be 15 seconds, see object, wait 15 seconds again for the next?\n\nBut they come as fast as you can reach behind the bed, and drop it on your bed. It even makes the mattress bounce a little.  If you weren't aware of that, how come the bounce didn't need a 15 second delay once you realize it should do that, but had already hit the mattress?\n\nIn fact, don't interrupt the process of \"continuous manifestation\" (as don Juan and Genaro did for Carlos).  Do it smoothly and moderately fast, or the emanations will reskim when your skin crawls from it.\n\nA pipe in the computer world is a place you can put things that had a delay, and then stack them up one after the other, so they come out the other end rapidly even though each one gets to have it's delay.\n\nIt's a delay on starting to spit them out, without any delays between them.\n\nDoesn't seem likely.  What kind of a que could hold, \"Hamburger, pencil, excrement, bizarre alien  hand\".\n\nDoesn't really seem like a good match.\n\nThen there's the double coming out, using the Affection pass.\n\nMy latest hobby.\n\nHe comes out one limb at a time if you watch.  A leg, some arms, a hand.\n\nIf you are watching his hand it sucks you in, and you start to use his vision and thinking.\n\nThere were 2 things Carlos tolerated in class discussions.  I don't really know why.\n\nAngry politics (in some of his inner circle) and bad science.\n\nWith the angry politics, he'd give a weird laugh that made it seem like he agreed with the angry person and the hateful political point they made.\n\nCastaneda followers seem to come with angry political obsessions.  I even see angry politics (foreign) on her facebook page.\n\nThen there was the bad science Carlos allowed. \n\nHe  even let it spread into workshop explanations given by the Chacmools.\n\nLike, \"You only use 10% of your brain.  We're working to increase that to 100%.\"\n\nAh!!!!  Now I get it.  Sorcery is all very scientific. Thank God!\n\nThat's what a cult does, when they don't actually have any magic. They explain how magic is possible, using \"science\".  That gets the bad players happy. They like to memorize facts an reasons, not actually have any magic.\n\nBut that 10% thing is nonsense.\n\nFirst, the brain is not a CPU.  It has no CPU.  So there's no way \"not to use\" any of it.\n\nIt's all, always used.  It can't not be used.\n\nFor the technically minded, there's no clock.  Every single \"instruction\" runs once every 1/40th, to 1/400th of  a second.   That's what makes us so smart.  Parallel processing.\n\nThat completely false \"saying\" about using only 10% was popular in the 90s.  They even made that cool movie, \"Lucy\" based on that misunderstanding.\n\nCarlos grinned when one of the women told us her brilliant realization.  \n\nI got the impression it came from one of the less active inner circle women, but since I'm face blind I can only say she had dark hair.  Might have been his doctor.  Could have been Reni too.\n\nWasn't Amy or the Chacmools who came up with that sales pitch.", "edited": 1642882427.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_htry69x", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except there isn&amp;#39;t any visual stimuli in the darkroom.

Physics is only valid at this position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see that nightly these days!  I have an &amp;quot;embarrassment of riches&amp;quot; lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course a scientist would say, well show someone.  If you can lay flat on the air 2 feet above the floor, like it was a bed, then show us!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita taught me that trick...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to be at that distant position of the assemblage point to perceive it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only are they incapable of perceiving it, but they&amp;#39;ll tug on your own assemblage point, and prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a vicious loop. For narrow minded &amp;quot;scientists&amp;quot; (which makes them not one), it&amp;#39;s only valid &amp;quot;up here&amp;quot;.  Anything &amp;quot;down there&amp;quot; is not real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they&amp;#39;ve divided our perception into &amp;quot;allowed&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;not allowed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s manifesting objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can do that rapidly.  If manifested objects were delayed pseudo visual stimuli, you&amp;#39;d have to have a &amp;quot;pipe&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You think, &amp;quot;Hamburger&amp;quot; and 15 seconds later you get a hamburger?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s no fun!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t even remember that long, surrounded by Fairies and Dragons.  Sometimes 5 seconds is the maximum you can recall something, that far out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Truth is, you can reach behind the bed and pull an &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; out instantly.  And you&amp;#39;ll be expecting it to fail, because it&amp;#39;s so absurd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it works anyway, in the deep orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if that had a &amp;quot;secret 15 second mental delay&amp;quot; on it, the next one comes out as fast as you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;d have to stack them up ahead of time, to give the illusion of coming rapidly. Which they do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How deep is that stack?  Can  you only manifest 4 rapidly, and then you experience delays?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was it designed to hold 256 manifested objects?  Most of my computer designs use that deep of a pipe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m talking as an engineer here.  If you want to get mechanical with medical studies, then carry the analogy forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How come you can manifest objects, one after the other?  Shouldn&amp;#39;t it be 15 seconds, see object, wait 15 seconds again for the next?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they come as fast as you can reach behind the bed, and drop it on your bed. It even makes the mattress bounce a little.  If you weren&amp;#39;t aware of that, how come the bounce didn&amp;#39;t need a 15 second delay once you realize it should do that, but had already hit the mattress?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, don&amp;#39;t interrupt the process of &amp;quot;continuous manifestation&amp;quot; (as don Juan and Genaro did for Carlos).  Do it smoothly and moderately fast, or the emanations will reskim when your skin crawls from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A pipe in the computer world is a place you can put things that had a delay, and then stack them up one after the other, so they come out the other end rapidly even though each one gets to have it&amp;#39;s delay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a delay on starting to spit them out, without any delays between them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t seem likely.  What kind of a que could hold, &amp;quot;Hamburger, pencil, excrement, bizarre alien  hand&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t really seem like a good match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the double coming out, using the Affection pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My latest hobby.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He comes out one limb at a time if you watch.  A leg, some arms, a hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are watching his hand it sucks you in, and you start to use his vision and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were 2 things Carlos tolerated in class discussions.  I don&amp;#39;t really know why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Angry politics (in some of his inner circle) and bad science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the angry politics, he&amp;#39;d give a weird laugh that made it seem like he agreed with the angry person and the hateful political point they made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Castaneda followers seem to come with angry political obsessions.  I even see angry politics (foreign) on her facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there was the bad science Carlos allowed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He  even let it spread into workshop explanations given by the Chacmools.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, &amp;quot;You only use 10% of your brain.  We&amp;#39;re working to increase that to 100%.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ah!!!!  Now I get it.  Sorcery is all very scientific. Thank God!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what a cult does, when they don&amp;#39;t actually have any magic. They explain how magic is possible, using &amp;quot;science&amp;quot;.  That gets the bad players happy. They like to memorize facts an reasons, not actually have any magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that 10% thing is nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, the brain is not a CPU.  It has no CPU.  So there&amp;#39;s no way &amp;quot;not to use&amp;quot; any of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all, always used.  It can&amp;#39;t not be used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the technically minded, there&amp;#39;s no clock.  Every single &amp;quot;instruction&amp;quot; runs once every 1/40th, to 1/400th of  a second.   That&amp;#39;s what makes us so smart.  Parallel processing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That completely false &amp;quot;saying&amp;quot; about using only 10% was popular in the 90s.  They even made that cool movie, &amp;quot;Lucy&amp;quot; based on that misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos grinned when one of the women told us her brilliant realization.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the impression it came from one of the less active inner circle women, but since I&amp;#39;m face blind I can only say she had dark hair.  Might have been his doctor.  Could have been Reni too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;#39;t Amy or the Chacmools who came up with that sales pitch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/s9urrn/new_study_shows_a_15second_lag_in_processing/htry69x/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1642877689.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_s9urrn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_s9urrn", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "htrf5ms", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_s9urrn", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "Even CBS caught wind of the fact that our most significant and formative studies can't be replicated and are BS.

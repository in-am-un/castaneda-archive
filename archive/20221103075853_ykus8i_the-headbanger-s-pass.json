In fact, the tendency is to keep finding more options, in order to get out of actually working on any.\n\nIt is in fact universal to humans who are stuck up at the blue line on the J curve.  With the heavy self-reflective oriented socialization we have in modern times.\n\nIt's part of why people obsess over dumb stuff like being \"impeccable\", or \"the warrior's way\".\n\nIf you want to see how silly the warrior's way is, watch \"The Mandalorian\".\n\nThe Mandalorian is a show about the assassin/bounty hunter clan from the original second set of 3 star wars.\n\nThe guy in the weird red self-flying suit who is hired to kill the princess.\n\nThe newer star wars turn everything upside down, and the bad guys become the good guys all over the place.\n\nAnd somewhere in there we hear that the Mandalorian tribes consider the Jedi to be ancient Enemy sorcerers.\n\nThat ought to alert you right away to the possibility we have some Soledad the witch tinkering going on in that script.\n\nAnd the Mandalorians use their technological and self-control warrior's code obsessions to make money.  They profit from their very formalized and rigid way of life.\n\nThey say things like, \"It is the way\" when they're stuck with some unpleasant task they don't want to do.\n\nThey're serious, sullen, and never seem to have a good time.\n\nIn fact, the only enjoyment the star Mandalorian seems to have in his life, is the cloned baby Jedi.\n\nTheir philosophy doesn't allow fun.  They aren't even allowed to take off their helmet and show their face to any other human.\n\nDroids are ok though.  Those are like inorganic beings.  Too alien to be embarrassed around.\n\nMeanwhile the replacement Jedi in that new star wars series, cloned from Yoda and Luke,  seem to do not much of anything but have a good time.\n\nUsing their \"enemy sorcerer\" powers.\n\nIt's my take on it, but it's actually quite relevant to Tensegrity and darkroom practice.\n\n\"The Mastery of Intent\" is what sorcery really is.\n\nYou won't find that mentioned in any of the \"courses\" offered by fake teachers of sorcery.  I suppose just saying that will cause some to add it now, but up until this point they just tried to find more \"topics\" from the books, to distract people with.  And they'd make up new ones, if they seemed to fit with the old.\n\nTo give their victims (\"students\") the impression they 're  learning, based on intellectual analysis. And by giving them ideas for how to pat themselves on the back for phony success.\n\nIf you give beginners a way to pretend success and officially endorse that kind of behavior, they'll brainwash themselves.  Self flattery will overcome their sobriety.  Look at how Monroe stole from so many people with his pretend magic system!  He used self-flattery.\n\nThe fake sorcery teachers like Miguel, Ken, Armando, Victor, Lujan, Nagual Speedos, Sergio and far too many more for me to name, really \"screw you over\" with their con game.\n\nBut why?  How can a little misinformation hurt much?\n\nYou already know the answer I'll give you,  if you did any reading at all of my old posts.\n\nBut you still haven't understood it.\n\nThey have the \"wrong intent\".\n\nIt just sounds so vague.  Sorcery is \"the mastery of intent\", but we don't really believe in \"the force\".\n\nIt sounds great in a movie, but in real life we only pretend to believe in it, despite what we claim.\n\nOr we'd make better efforts to learn.\n\nSorcery progress is only made, when you realize \"the force\" is real.\n\nAnd stop seeking pretend teachers of pretend magic, in favor of getting more of the \"real kind\" you've discovered.\n\nAccepting the counterfeit, meaning magic that has no magic, or remote-viewing where you don't actually view things at a distance, is madness itself.\n\nIt means you're stuck in your internal dialogue, fantasizing from one topic to the next and never stopping to just look at what's actually in front of you.\n\nA \"code of ethics\" isn't going to help that.\n\nWhat you need, is to just take an honest look at what's before you.  Without prejudice, expectations, hopes, desires, wants, needs, or anything at all that twists the results to fit what makes you feel better.\n\nThere's a reason don Juan said that all the \"Men of Knowledge\" he knows come from the orphans licking the plates at the outdoor restaurant because they have no parents to take care of them.\n\nThose lost souls aren't \"in love with the promises of the world\" the way non-orphans believe themselves to be.\n\nDon Juan alternately uses Men of Knowledge to refer to the old Olmec profiteers who used rituals to do magic, but also to anyone on the path we follow, to master intent.\n\nBut it's mostly because Carlos asked to be taught about power plants, so don Juan got him into the habit of admiring those guys.\n\nWho in case new people don't know, were such profiteering pests the Olmec government actually required \"Men of Knowledge\" to get licenses to practice.\n\nSome bakers, some mask makers, some dancers, and some \"Ayahuasca Ceremony\" handlers.\n\nI'm using that symbolically of course, as a bit of a joke. But to assume the \"Man of Knowledge\" types, those who need drugs to move their assemblage points, have the kind of knowledge we seek, is very much like believing that the guy peddling drug trips to tourists is an actual sorcerer.\n\nI wouldn't even be surprised if the drug Cartels in Mexico owned those guys.\n\nCholita started there.  But a Castaneda \"endorsed\" one in Mexico.\n\nYou ride up a dangerous road  to a mountain plateau, find some peyote, and the leader makes sure you don't take your clothes off and start running around hugging cactus bushes.\n\nSome old friends of Carlos had a connection to it. No one I know has ever figured out the details, seeing as how Carlos never advocated power plants at all in private classes or workshops.\n\nBut somehow Cholita took a fancy to his paperback books, got led into a peyote experience up there where others from the inner circle and private classes had gone, and then one of the oldest friends of Carlos took her in.\n\nDuring the peyote ceremony she traveled so far into the second attention that the leader had to \"talk her down\".  Cholita implies she was staring into some kind of tunnel of white light and couldn't escape its pull.  The leader became concerned for her.\n\nCarlos took her from there, controlling all aspects of her life.  She's still living in the bubble he created.\n\nSo there are drug profiteering types in the background of sorcery,  even at our origins 8000 years ago.\n\nBut if you focus on those nothing will ever come of it.\n\nIt's actually silencing the mind and pursuing magic you can really experience, then figuring out how to make that stronger each day, that leads to our goal of Silent Knowledge.\n\nA fancy name for \"seer\".\n\nIn order to get there you have to toss off the junk.\n\nNot accumulate more of it.\n\nYou can't memorize sorcery facts,  analyze things from a \"new perspective\", or even pretend to be noble and warrior like, impeccable, or anything else you might come up with to aid  your pretending.\n\nCarlos called such people \"masturbators\".  Openly too.\n\nAll of that is the same old thing everyone is doing. In all systems.\n\nJust pretending, by inflating an extremely tiny bit of magic they can extract from their ineffective techniques.\n\nWhat you first need is \"magic in your face\" daily.  But \"shocking\" or surprising magic. Not the kind induced by daily meditation which lulls you into a self-reflective, self-flattering routine.\n\nYou need \"weirdness\" so that you have a measuring tool for your progress.  The magic in our face at first might only be at the same level impotent systems can produce.  The \"green line\" effects of the J curve.  There's pictures on the map I drew up. Go look and you'll find your \"enlightenment\" at the pathetic start of that very long path.   Past that, no other system ever ventures.\n\nBut the key to actual progress is to isolate useful magical sights from too much pretending, so they stand out as a real \"thing\".  Use those to \"pull\" you the right direction.\n\nThen you try to get more of that \"thing\".  Consciously.  Knowing that silence is the key to letting it pull your assemblage point downwards.\n\nThe tensegrity was what Carlos came up with, because unknown to the workshop crowd any tiny bit of magic you notice while doing it, remains mostly visible as you continue to practice daily.\n\nIt \"stores\" into your movement.  And builds up to produce even more magic in the future.\n\nTensegrity is a container, for the magic resulting from intent.\n\nIt could be anything.  Maybe even a feeling of \"energy\".\n\nThat's what Cholita gets.\n\nThat's too vague for me.\n\nI'd rather have a horrible demon materialize in front of me and threaten to bite my head off. Preferably with one dead rotting eye.  I like that obviously \"show-biz\" look. It gives you insight on the IOBs themselves.  I sure wish I could have seen the original \"Lucifer\", prince of the demons as seen by the inept Jewish Prophets.  Man... The jungian implications in that inorganic being manifestation!\n\nBut others might find the unbiased \"puffs\" of your energy body useful as a compromise to \"energy\", or \"terror\".\n\nYou need something real!\n\nAnd anything that's just you fantasizing about how powerful and famous you'll be one day, or how much you can profit from it, is \"counter intent\".\n\nIt's not on the path of \"the mastery of intent\".\n\nThat path requires you to cast off stuff. Not accumulate more.  Or even simply modify what you have.\n\nSorcerers can't be hoarders!\n\nThere's an odd form of dance that must seem old hat to all of you, but I was never exposed to it.\n\nHeadbanging.\n\nYou have loud music, and then you flop your head around in almost violent circles, making your hair whip in a display of frantic movement.\n\nIt gets people high.\n\nIt's often accompanied by \"mosh pit dancing\", where you smash into the other dancers in an ecstatic trance.\n\nOddly, it's an effective way to move the assemblage point to the start of the green zone.\n\nViolent, harmful to the body, but people do it is because it works.\n\nThat combined with the music must produce something similar to the \"Yoga high\" you get when laying down and resting with eyes closed after a yoga class.\n\nOr the high you get from meditating using a replacement internal dialogue, like a mantra or contemplation of puzzles or mysteries.\n\nPeople describe that as bliss.\n\nBut it's still along the same lines as Headbanging.\n\nYou start  to pay attention to what's really in front of you.\n\nTo what you are feeling, and perceiving.\n\nInstead of thinking and scheming and regretting, and reliving old shit.\n\nYou stop fantasizing for a while and just \"feel the sensations\".\n\nThe \"Life Saver Pass\" is an excellent example  of that.\n\nIn fact it's almost headbangerish.\n\nThe movement is nearly violent.  Or certainly, it's one of the most active passes in tensegrity.\n\nAnd it causes the blood to rush around in ways that can generate faint flecklike colors, or even circles in your eyes.\n\nIf you ever rolled your eyeballs around in an extreme circle while closed, you might have noticed that it deforms the eyeball and creates a perfect yellowish grey circle.\n\nAnd somewhere approaching middle age, a lot of males find that if they stand up too fast after looking at the bottom shelves in the hardware store, they nearly pass out.\n\nIt's your blood pooling down on the floor as you stoop, suddenly being stretched out as you stand, leading too much to drain out of the head.\n\nYou can literally pass out.\n\nThe life saver pass evokes this sort of effect.\n\nDone in perfect darkness there's pretty much no way there won't be some visual effect.\n\nLittle flakes of pinkishness might fill the room as you spin. At the end of each turn you might find those yellow eyeball circles form because of how your eyeballs tend to copy the extreme twist.\n\nRandom yellow flashes will happen, and you might even see wafts of \"second attention smoke\" around you.\n\nWhen you tap your shoulder with your fingers,  you put a \"thud\" into the blood rushing around.\n\nWith an \"expectation\" of something important.\n\nIt is in fact an amazing fireworks show if you can get silent and stop glossing.\n\nYou can't be fantasizing about how to get that job promotion. Or what to wear for your hot date. Or how much work you have to put in,  to write your best selling \"sorcery book\".\n\nYou have to just watch what's in front of you.  The real honest truth of what your eyes are picking up from infinity.\n\nI can't imagine anyone could possibly see \"nothing\".  Not if done in perfect darkness with  your eyes open.\n\nCould a headbanger see and feel nothing, thrashing around in circles?\n\nBut the life saver pass is fairly \"gentle\".  It's a common warm up exercise.  So people even confused the tensegrity pass for the ordinary variety.\n\nJadey had to make a video to correct that so we wouldn't lose this amazing pass.\n\nSo the life saver pass gives you the \"headbanger\" effect without all the harm, and when done in darkness it gives you a not-doing second attention light show.\n\nIf you watch that without expectations and \"feel\" how the muscles are smoothly repeating the same motion, focusing on not using any that aren't needed, then you find the \"topper\" Carlos added to summon intent.\n\nThe \"goal\" of the pass.  That which requires  concentration.\n\nTo tap only the fleshy part of the upper arm, and only with the fingers.\n\nIt's a genius combination of inevitable effects you could only honestly comprehend, once you realize what intent is.\n\nAnd it's a movement that the energy body loves.  Either that, or the twisting won't allow it to remain on the walls of your egg.\n\nHe can't resist coming off the walls to participate.\n\nI used the analogy of puppies in a barrel previously. If you had a herd of sleeping puppies in a huge barrel, what would happen if you started dancing and singing joyously in the midst of them?\n\nInstant puppy party! They'd be jumping up and leaping and barking, to join you.\n\nYour double does that too when you do the lifesaver pass.\n\nYou can find him behind the pink sparkles and vague changes in our vision that are inevitable with a pass this \"active\", which disrupts blood flow and causes the eyeballs to travel to extremes. It also twists the back.  It's guaranteed to produce visual results, if you can be silent and just look at what's actually in front of your eyes.\n\nIf you can't, you are lost in fantasy land and urgently need to do something to clear up your vision.\n\nBehind that you'll see the swirling purple of the energy body, if you can focus on the \"physically generated\" stuff without judgement.\n\nIf you can find any of the purple energy body joining in, it will become more visible until it forms a purple cloud all around you.\n\nAnd you'll find that if you can perceive that as a whole, there's a dream forming just 8 feet past that all around you.\n\nYou end up in another world.\n\nThe pass produces a \"diffuse\" energy body that's visible amidst the chaos, and an \"escape route\" becomes available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Headbanger's Pass", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"1u3xvn64iox91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 72, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1u3xvn64iox91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85667759f7a57823c5b2b3d8e9f5ad1455057c11"}, {"y": 144, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1u3xvn64iox91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c5ec78f4ab1efb42c8f727a04b60e91bbd36b8c"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1u3xvn64iox91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1416a502c7b2bfac3dfcdbc974122eb7f9edd6c6"}, {"y": 426, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1u3xvn64iox91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76b6819bcd4d9a3db0f689dc5e785b39a3bc6bb8"}, {"y": 640, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1u3xvn64iox91.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17c7e6f1dc054cca2fc0aa504e0cdac3ceead403"}, {"y": 720, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1u3xvn64iox91.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f12993b204ada7633f27fef0643e3ca1151a642"}], "s": {"y": 2000, "x": 3000, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1u3xvn64iox91.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d6c6b463a871dc3b94f0415b3cdb590198ed94f"}, "id": "1u3xvn64iox91"}}, "name": "t3_ykus8i", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/MxvgLWmlENJhqrjOi5wkXRoPBc430d94OawhqpfxpaE.jpg", "edited": 1667503783.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1667458733.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1u3xvn64iox91.png?width=3000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0d6c6b463a871dc3b94f0415b3cdb590198ed94f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/1u3xvn64iox91.png?width=3000&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0d6c6b463a871dc3b94f0415b3cdb590198ed94f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been posting over in the advanced subreddit, because beginners really just need to pick something, and do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t need more options.

No one I know has ever figured out the details, seeing as how Carlos never advocated power plants at all in private classes or workshops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But somehow Cholita took a fancy to his paperback books, got led into a peyote experience up there where others from the inner circle and private classes had gone, and then one of the oldest friends of Carlos took her in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the peyote ceremony she traveled so far into the second attention that the leader had to &amp;quot;talk her down&amp;quot;.  Cholita implies she was staring into some kind of tunnel of white light and couldn&amp;#39;t escape its pull.  The leader became concerned for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos took her from there, controlling all aspects of her life.  She&amp;#39;s still living in the bubble he created.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there are drug profiteering types in the background of sorcery,  even at our origins 8000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you focus on those nothing will ever come of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually silencing the mind and pursuing magic you can really experience, then figuring out how to make that stronger each day, that leads to our goal of Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A fancy name for &amp;quot;seer&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to get there you have to toss off the junk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not accumulate more of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t memorize sorcery facts,  analyze things from a &amp;quot;new perspective&amp;quot;, or even pretend to be noble and warrior like, impeccable, or anything else you might come up with to aid  your pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos called such people &amp;quot;masturbators&amp;quot;.  Openly too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of that is the same old thing everyone is doing. In all systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just pretending, by inflating an extremely tiny bit of magic they can extract from their ineffective techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you first need is &amp;quot;magic in your face&amp;quot; daily.  But &amp;quot;shocking&amp;quot; or surprising magic. Not the kind induced by daily meditation which lulls you into a self-reflective, self-flattering routine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need &amp;quot;weirdness&amp;quot; so that you have a measuring tool for your progress.  The magic in our face at first might only be at the same level impotent systems can produce.  The &amp;quot;green line&amp;quot; effects of the J curve.  There&amp;#39;s pictures on the map I drew up. Go look and you&amp;#39;ll find your &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot; at the pathetic start of that very long path.   Past that, no other system ever ventures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the key to actual progress is to isolate useful magical sights from too much pretending, so they stand out as a real &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;.  Use those to &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; you the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you try to get more of that &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;.  Consciously.  Knowing that silence is the key to letting it pull your assemblage point downwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity was what Carlos came up with, because unknown to the workshop crowd any tiny bit of magic you notice while doing it, remains mostly visible as you continue to practice daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It &amp;quot;stores&amp;quot; into your movement.  And builds up to produce even more magic in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity is a container, for the magic resulting from intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It could be anything.  Maybe even a feeling of &amp;quot;energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what Cholita gets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s too vague for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d rather have a horrible demon materialize in front of me and threaten to bite my head off. Preferably with one dead rotting eye.  I like that obviously &amp;quot;show-biz&amp;quot; look. It gives you insight on the IOBs themselves.  I sure wish I could have seen the original &amp;quot;Lucifer&amp;quot;, prince of the demons as seen by the inept Jewish Prophets.  Man... The jungian implications in that inorganic being manifestation!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But others might find the unbiased &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot; of your energy body useful as a compromise to &amp;quot;energy&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;terror&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need something real!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And anything that&amp;#39;s just you fantasizing about how powerful and famous you&amp;#39;ll be one day, or how much you can profit from it, is &amp;quot;counter intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not on the path of &amp;quot;the mastery of intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That path requires you to cast off stuff. Not accumulate more.  Or even simply modify what you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers can&amp;#39;t be hoarders!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an odd form of dance that must seem old hat to all of you, but I was never exposed to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Headbanging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have loud music, and then you flop your head around in almost violent circles, making your hair whip in a display of frantic movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets people high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s often accompanied by &amp;quot;mosh pit dancing&amp;quot;, where you smash into the other dancers in an ecstatic trance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly, it&amp;#39;s an effective way to move the assemblage point to the start of the green zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Violent, harmful to the body, but people do it is because it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That combined with the music must produce something similar to the &amp;quot;Yoga high&amp;quot; you get when laying down and resting with eyes closed after a yoga class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the high you get from meditating using a replacement internal dialogue, like a mantra or contemplation of puzzles or mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People describe that as bliss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s still along the same lines as Headbanging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You start  to pay attention to what&amp;#39;s really in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To what you are feeling, and perceiving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of thinking and scheming and regretting, and reliving old shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You stop fantasizing for a while and just &amp;quot;feel the sensations&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Life Saver Pass&amp;quot; is an excellent example  of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact it&amp;#39;s almost headbangerish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movement is nearly violent.  Or certainly, it&amp;#39;s one of the most active passes in tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it causes the blood to rush around in ways that can generate faint flecklike colors, or even circles in your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you ever rolled your eyeballs around in an extreme circle while closed, you might have noticed that it deforms the eyeball and creates a perfect yellowish grey circle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And somewhere approaching middle age, a lot of males find that if they stand up too fast after looking at the bottom shelves in the hardware store, they nearly pass out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s your blood pooling down on the floor as you stoop, suddenly being stretched out as you stand, leading too much to drain out of the head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can literally pass out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The life saver pass evokes this sort of effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Done in perfect darkness there&amp;#39;s pretty much no way there won&amp;#39;t be some visual effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little flakes of pinkishness might fill the room as you spin. At the end of each turn you might find those yellow eyeball circles form because of how your eyeballs tend to copy the extreme twist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Random yellow flashes will happen, and you might even see wafts of &amp;quot;second attention smoke&amp;quot; around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you tap your shoulder with your fingers,  you put a &amp;quot;thud&amp;quot; into the blood rushing around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With an &amp;quot;expectation&amp;quot; of something important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is in fact an amazing fireworks show if you can get silent and stop glossing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t be fantasizing about how to get that job promotion. Or what to wear for your hot date. Or how much work you have to put in,  to write your best selling &amp;quot;sorcery book&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to just watch what&amp;#39;s in front of you.  The real honest truth of what your eyes are picking up from infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t imagine anyone could possibly see &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot;.  Not if done in perfect darkness with  your eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could a headbanger see and feel nothing, thrashing around in circles?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the life saver pass is fairly &amp;quot;gentle&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s a common warm up exercise.  So people even confused the tensegrity pass for the ordinary variety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jadey had to make a video to correct that so we wouldn&amp;#39;t lose this amazing pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the life saver pass gives you the &amp;quot;headbanger&amp;quot; effect without all the harm, and when done in darkness it gives you a not-doing second attention light show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you watch that without expectations and &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; how the muscles are smoothly repeating the same motion, focusing on not using any that aren&amp;#39;t needed, then you find the &amp;quot;topper&amp;quot; Carlos added to summon intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;goal&amp;quot; of the pass.  That which requires  concentration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To tap only the fleshy part of the upper arm, and only with the fingers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a genius combination of inevitable effects you could only honestly comprehend, once you realize what intent is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s a movement that the energy body loves.  Either that, or the twisting won&amp;#39;t allow it to remain on the walls of your egg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He can&amp;#39;t resist coming off the walls to participate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used the analogy of puppies in a barrel previously. If you had a herd of sleeping puppies in a huge barrel, what would happen if you started dancing and singing joyously in the midst of them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instant puppy party! They&amp;#39;d be jumping up and leaping and barking, to join you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your double does that too when you do the lifesaver pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can find him behind the pink sparkles and vague changes in our vision that are inevitable with a pass this &amp;quot;active&amp;quot;, which disrupts blood flow and causes the eyeballs to travel to extremes. It also twists the back.  It&amp;#39;s guaranteed to produce visual results, if you can be silent and just look at what&amp;#39;s actually in front of your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t, you are lost in fantasy land and urgently need to do something to clear up your vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Behind that you&amp;#39;ll see the swirling purple of the energy body, if you can focus on the &amp;quot;physically generated&amp;quot; stuff without judgement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can find any of the purple energy body joining in, it will become more visible until it forms a purple cloud all around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll find that if you can perceive that as a whole, there&amp;#39;s a dream forming just 8 feet past that all around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You end up in another world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pass produces a &amp;quot;diffuse&amp;quot; energy body that&amp;#39;s visible amidst the chaos, and an &amp;quot;escape route&amp;quot; becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "c812fe20-6005-11ea-a726-0e9c39b3b989", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "ykus8i", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 31, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ykus8i/the_headbangers_pass/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ykus8i/the_headbangers_pass/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1667458733.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iuyc92r", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iuy82ib", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Just be sure you understand, sorcery is done DAILY.

I only saw a notification without all the text.\n\nI'm glad you know you need a darkroom.\n\nSo, most important points:\n\nWe are not looking for weird stuff, so we can brag to our friends.\n\nWe aren't trying to compete with the \"psycho-nauts\", even though very soon you will kick their butts, and drug free.\n\nWe're trying to view the effects of tensegrity, done in silence and darkness.\n\nWithout the tensegrity, you have no \"container\" in which to store the results of each day.\n\nI suppose you could make a different kind of container, even if you were hogtied and stuck in solitary confinement.  You could still find a path.\n\nBut the easiest path we know of is Tensegrity in the dark, done in silence.\n\nYou have the \"container\".  The tensegrity forms. Try to pick at least 3 sets, so you can see one cause the next to build up stronger.\n\nYou have darkness so that you can see 2 very real things that become visible,  when doing tensegrity in silence.\n\nYour energy body (the purple puffs), and inorganic being spirits.\n\nWho are almost \"around us\" somewhere, most of the time. \n\nBut no one can see them once they get past childhood.\n\nIf you start to do things like this they'll notice your activities, and begin to salivate.\n\nLike a stray dog looking at your bag of Cheetos.

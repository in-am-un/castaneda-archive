He used to show off a bit, by having one of the inner circle people ask him a question on a topic he couldn't possibly know, and then a few seconds later he was an expert on the topic.\n\nSadly, all you need to do that now is a cell phone with ChatGPT on it.\n\nBut back in the 90s it was an amazing demonstration of magic.\n\nI suppose some day when were all surrounded by flying cars and super intelligent robot servants, sorcery will seem a whole lot less cool.\n\nBut it's not surprising.\n\nSorcery is a form of technology.  It was developed over THOUSANDS of years.\n\nOur current \"modern science\" is really only hundreds of years old.\n\nLikely it could \"kick butt\" compared to Olmec magic if it had the same thousands of years to grow.\n\nExcept, it seems that Star Wars has a lesson there too.\n\nEven with all the technology in that galaxy far, far away, the Jedi and the Sith still control everything.\n\nPerhaps a commentary on the relationship between real magic, and real science.\n\nAs for whether you could be in silent knowledge all the time I suppose you might want to ask, could a marathon runner be running all the time?\n\nCould Arnold Schwarzenegger go around tossing over \"Smart Cars\" constantly?\n\nCould Nikki Minaj...\n\nBetter not use that example.\n\nWhatever the analogy, this question of whether you could always be in silent knowledge is a beginner's question!\n\nThere's nothing wrong with it, but it's tainted with Eastern fake magic.\n\nWith the idea of a binary situation where you have a \"realization\", and then you're all done.\n\nYou're permanently superman.\n\nThat's a con game, like Yogananda's \"Self Realization Fellowship\".\n\nWhere he mixed Christianity with Yoga, dethroned Christ, put himself up on that throne instead, and started a church franchise across the nation.  \n\nSo he could rake in money from people's existing delusions by giving them tired old closed eye meditation techniques, which only lead to self-flattery.\n\nNonsense designed to sooth people who have extra money to spend, so as to enrich that guru con artist.\n\nBut worse, all that \"magic noise\" from different phonies clouds the minds of beginners, who expect that you just do a little work, and you're all done.\n\nBecause all the mystics, gurus, and \"Masters\" said it was so.\n\nThat you only need to \"reach a higher state\".\n\nNonsense.\n\nI hope you can read between the lines here.\n\nYou get real magic.\n\nBut never as much as you want.\n\nThat's what drove the old seers.\n\nGreed for more magic.\n\nWe benefit from their greed running unhindered for thousands of years.\n\nBut even they couldn't do whatever they wanted, all the time.\n\nThus when the Olmecs were invaded by neighboring tribes, the old seers were \"fiascos\".\n\nAs don Juan described it.\n\nThe ones who did better were the \"Men of Knowledge\", who still lived their ordinary lives, struggling to earn a living selling magic talking lizard shows.\n\nThey weren't nearly as powerful as the old seers!\n\nBut they worked harder to get what they got, and were organizers in their communities.\n\nSo they could put up a better fight than the old seers, whose hobbies included lowering themselves down into dark caves, by the belly button.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [],

Bridges even.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But assuming you could go into a dream, realize it&amp;#39;s a dream, look at your hands, and then look around from object to object, and back at your hands as the instructions go, you could get a feeling for what SK is like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, the danger here is that you just summoned a scout to come see what you&amp;#39;re up to.  Inside the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you may need to learn to zoom over to distant objects, to get away from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beating them up won&amp;#39;t work. One scout can easily make 5 zombie copies of itself to attack you with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you need to find some &amp;quot;peace and quiet&amp;quot; to test this out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, just play with the objects around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find one you like, and observe if it&amp;#39;s stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then turn around so your back is facing it, wait a few seconds, and turn back to see it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it the same now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find something light, like a leaf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you toss it around by waving your hand?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Play with that, and you&amp;#39;ll begin to understand what Silent Knowledge is like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Afterall, you get it when you align the two assemblage points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That of the dreamer, and that of your physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The difference between doing that inside a dream, and doing it awake in SK, is how much purpose and rationality you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without much purpose, you tune in on phantom copies of things instead of the real one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly just being in your physical body, mostly, is enough to limit the range of silent knowledge topics to &amp;quot;the real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_172y0aj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/172y0aj/silent_knowledge_tunnels_and_silence_objects/k448od4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1696851561.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k40n6jb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Brilliant_Draw9334", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1696787422.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_172y0aj", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_k6vvk10ej", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "\\&gt; As for whether you could be in silent knowledge all the time I suppose you might want to ask, could a marathon runner be running all the time? \n\nDo you mean that if if we don't nail the AP at that point, we can't keep the AP there for a long time, or under no circumstances can we always be in silent knowledge?

Those are slightly \"under\" your internal dialogue, so even if you get rid of the internal dialogue, those prejudices are still there, coloring the SK.\n\nAnd so because of our expectations from streaming media, you can even \"rewind\" dreams you summon in the air.\n\nDreams you can leap into, with the help of an ally (at first).\n\nSo, you can summon dream bubbles to form around you, find one you like, watch it a while, and then \"swipe\" it back to a previous point you like, and literally jump into it.\n\nNo kidding. I've done it so many times I couldn't count them.\n\nKeep in mind, you are fully awake, eyes wide open (get an air humidifier to help with that), absolutely sober (although if you had wine or marijuana earlier, as long as it's worn off it has virtually zero effect other than to make you tired), and walking around or doing Tensegrity to make sure you don't doze off by accident.\n\nFully awake, in your physical body, you leap into a dream.\n\nThere's no way to explain why you don't have a bump on your head or bruises on your arms the next day.\n\nYou really do seem to be able to leap into dreams, and the physical body \"shrinks away\" for a while.\n\nWhatever is really going on there, the old seers took huge advantage of it to live far beyond when they ought to have died.\n\nHundreds of years longer, and in rare cases thousands.\n\nMy guess is, they learned to \"shrink\" their physical body on demand, by traveling into dream worlds the way I just describe (which YOU can do also), and then they discovered that you could bury your physical body in a tiny cave under a huge rock, and never come back.\n\nJust stay in that dream for what I estimate to be at least from when the Toltec Empire ended, in Tula in 1150AD, to when Carlos ran into those old seers at the big rock.\n\nSo \\~1975-1150 = 825 years.\n\nI suppose I have to admit, they beat my record of staying in a dream for 2 weeks.\n\nHere's a picture showing dream bubbles, and explaining that if  you can find a key \"feeling\" while gazing into the dream, you can enter. The \"key feelings\" of each are brighter so you can get an idea of what it means. Doesn't have to be anything important.

Those are slightly &amp;quot;under&amp;quot; your internal dialogue, so even if you get rid of the internal dialogue, those prejudices are still there, coloring the SK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so because of our expectations from streaming media, you can even &amp;quot;rewind&amp;quot; dreams you summon in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dreams you can leap into, with the help of an ally (at first).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, you can summon dream bubbles to form around you, find one you like, watch it a while, and then &amp;quot;swipe&amp;quot; it back to a previous point you like, and literally jump into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No kidding. I&amp;#39;ve done it so many times I couldn&amp;#39;t count them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, you are fully awake, eyes wide open (get an air humidifier to help with that), absolutely sober (although if you had wine or marijuana earlier, as long as it&amp;#39;s worn off it has virtually zero effect other than to make you tired), and walking around or doing Tensegrity to make sure you don&amp;#39;t doze off by accident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fully awake, in your physical body, you leap into a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no way to explain why you don&amp;#39;t have a bump on your head or bruises on your arms the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You really do seem to be able to leap into dreams, and the physical body &amp;quot;shrinks away&amp;quot; for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever is really going on there, the old seers took huge advantage of it to live far beyond when they ought to have died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of years longer, and in rare cases thousands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess is, they learned to &amp;quot;shrink&amp;quot; their physical body on demand, by traveling into dream worlds the way I just describe (which YOU can do also), and then they discovered that you could bury your physical body in a tiny cave under a huge rock, and never come back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just stay in that dream for what I estimate to be at least from when the Toltec Empire ended, in Tula in 1150AD, to when Carlos ran into those old seers at the big rock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So ~1975-1150 = 825 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose I have to admit, they beat my record of staying in a dream for 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a picture showing dream bubbles, and explaining that if  you can find a key &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; while gazing into the dream, you can enter. The &amp;quot;key feelings&amp;quot; of each are brighter so you can get an idea of what it means. Doesn&amp;#39;t have to be anything important.

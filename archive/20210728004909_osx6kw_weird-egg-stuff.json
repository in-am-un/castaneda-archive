It was part of keeping us all on the same page.\n\nI used to think it was because it was very annoying to have someone correct you, on your own book.\n\nBut more likely it was the same as I have to do in here.\n\nFight off distractions which harm the chances of everyone to learn.\n\nI'm not completely sure why, but I got interested in \"egg\" in the books.\n\nCould be the tasty egg salad I have going in the pressure cooker right now.\n\nThe shells come right off, if you let the pressure out quickly. Blows the shells off the egg.\n\nOr, it could be that Techno got the idea the egg shell was tied to our physical matter, and the crack breaking open was also somehow related.\n\nI'd never thought of that.\n\nMy assumption was that the eagle took a dump in his nest.  The egg was his turd, and the nest was the emanations, and there you were.\n\nThat's how you were created.\n\nAfter all, the memories of dead people are his food.\n\nSo he has to take a dump, right?\n\nAnd it explains people who come in here, and have to get kicked out.\n\nThey aren't \"bad players\".   They're simply turds.\n\nMy original idea that we're created with the shell in the first place,  has some problems.\n\nFor instance, Carlos started talking about how we were free to roam the dark sea of awareness, before we got stuck here.\n\nThat implies we've had 2 \"births\".\n\nSo I searched for \"egg\" in the all in one books.\n\nI saw some very weird stuff...  Turns out, we don't have a very good understanding of things.\n\nBut now, we have a chance to! \n\nWe don't just read the books like everyone did for the last 25 years since Carlos tried to teach us.\n\nWe've now done half of it!    Pity we can't interest more.  \n\nSo we can figure out the other half, or even \"try it out\", to clarify.\n\nIt's never happened before!\n\nHere's what I found:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"Do you know why we called Juan Matus the Nagual?\" Nestor asked me.\n\nI said that I had always thought that that was their nice way of calling don Juan a sorcerer.\n\nBenigno laughed so loudly that the sound of his laughter drowned out everybody else's. He seemed to be enjoying himself immensely. He rested his head on my shoulder as if it were a heavy object he could no longer support.\n\n\"The reason we called him the Nagual,\" Nestor went on, \"is because he was split in two. In other words, any time he needed to, he could get into another track that we don't have ourselves. Something would come out of him; something that was not a double, but a horrendous, menacing shape that looked like him but was twice his size. We call that shape the nagual and anybody who has it is, of course, the Nagual.\n\n\"The Nagual told us that all of us can have that shape coming out of our heads if we wanted to, but chances are that none of us would want to. Genaro didn't want it, so I think we don't want it, either. So it appears that you're the one who's stuck with it.\"\n\nThey cackled and yelled as if they were corralling a herd of cattle. Benigno put his arms around my shoulders without opening his eyes and laughed until tears were rolling down his cheeks.\n\n\"Why do you say that I am stuck with it?\" I asked Nestor.\n\n\"It takes too much energy,\" he said, \"too much work. I don't know how you can still be standing.\n\n\"The Nagual and Genaro split you once in the eucalyptus grove. They took you there because eucalyptuses are your trees. I was there myself and I witnessed when they split you and pulled your nagual out. They pulled you apart by the ears until they had split your luminosity and you were not an egg anymore, but two long chunks of luminosity. Then they put you together again, but any sorcerer that sees can tell that there is a huge gap in the middle.\"\n\n\"What's the advantage of being split?\"\n\n\"You have one ear that hears everything and one eye that sees everything and you will always be able to go an extra mile in a moment of need. That splitting is also the reason why they told us that you are the Maestro.\n\n\"They tried to split Pablito but it looks like it failed. He's too pampered and has always indulged like a bastard. That's why he's so screwed up now.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe sat on the bench later that night. I had refrained from talking about what happened to us until we had a chance to sit there. La Gorda was at first unwilling to say anything. My mind was in a peculiar state of exhilaration. I had had similar moments with don Juan, but they were associated, as a rule, with the aftereffects of hallucinogenic plants.\n\nI began by describing to la Gorda what I had seen. The feature of those luminous eggs that had impressed me the most was their movements. They did not walk. They moved in a floating manner, yet they were grounded. The way they moved was not pleasing. Their movements were stilted, wooden, and jerky.\n\nWhen they were in motion the whole egg shape became smaller and rounder. They seemed to jump or jerk, or shake up and down with great speed. The result was a most annoying nervous shivering. Perhaps the closest I can get to describing the physical discomfort caused by their motion would be to say that I felt as if the images on a moving picture screen had been speeded up.\n\nAnother thing that had intrigued me was that I could not detect any legs. I had once seen a ballet production in which the dancers mimicked the movement of soldiers on ice skates. For that effect, they wore loose tunics that hung all the way to the floor. There was no way to see their feet, thus the illusion that they were gliding on ice.\n\nThe luminous eggs that paraded in front of me gave the impression that they were sliding on a rough surface. Their luminosity shook up and down almost imperceptibly, yet enough to make me nearly ill. When the eggs were in repose they became elongated. Some of them were so long and rigid that they brought to mind the idea of a wooden icon.\n\nAnother even more disturbing feature of the luminous eggs was the absence of eyes. I had never realized so acutely how we are drawn to the eyes of living beings. The luminous eggs were thoroughly alive. They were observing me with great curiosity. I could see them jerking up and down; leaning over to watch me, but without any eyes.\n\nMany of those luminous eggs had black spots on them, huge spots below the midsection. Others did not. La Gorda had told me that reproduction affects the bodies of both men and women by causing a hole to appear below the stomach, but the spots on those luminous eggs did not seem like holes to me. They were areas with no luminosity, but there was no depth to them.\n\nThose that had the black spots seemed to be mellow, tired. The crest of their egg shape was wilted. It looked opaque in comparison to the rest of their glow. The ones without spots, on the other hand, were dazzlingly bright. I fancied them to be dangerous. They were vibrant; filled with energy and whiteness.\n\nLa Gorda said that the instant I rested my head on her she also entered into a state that resembled dreaming. She was awake, yet she could not move. She was conscious that people were milling around us. Then she saw them turning into luminous blobs and finally into egg-shaped creatures.\n\nShe did not know that I was also seeing. She had thought at first that I was watching over her, but at one moment the pressure of my head was so heavy that she concluded quite consciously that I too must have been seeing. Only after I straightened up and caught the young man fondling her as she seemed to sleep, did I have an inkling of what might be happening to her.\n\nOur visions differed in that she could distinguish men from women by the shape of some filaments that she called 'roots'. Women, she said, had thick bundles of filaments that resembled a lion's tail. They grew inward from the place of the genitalia. She explained that those roots were the givers of life. The embryo, in order to accomplish its growth, attaches itself to one of those nurturing roots and thoroughly consumes it, leaving only a hole.\n\nMen, on the other hand, had short filaments that were alive and floating almost separately from the luminous mass of their bodies.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt is only from the Eagle's actions that a seer can tell what it wants. The Eagle, although it is not moved by the circumstances of any living thing, has granted a gift to each of those beings.\n\nIn those beings' own way, and by right, any one of them, if it so desires, has the power to keep the flame of awareness; the power to disobey the summons to 'die and be consumed'.\n\nEvery living thing has been granted the power, if it so desires, to seek an opening to freedom and to go through it. It is evident to the seer who sees the opening, and to the creatures that go through it, that the Eagle has granted that gift in order to perpetuate awareness.\n\nFor the purpose of guiding living things to that opening, the Eagle created the Nagual. The Nagual is a double being to whom the rule has been revealed.\n\nWhether the Nagual be in the form of a human being, an animal, a plant, or anything else that lives; the Nagual by virtue of its doubleness is drawn to seek that hidden passageway.\n\nIn human beings, the Nagual comes in pairs; male and female. A double man and a double woman become the Nagual only after the rule has been told to each of them, and each of them has understood it and accepted it in full.\n\nTo the eye of the seer, a Nagual man or Nagual woman appears as a luminous egg with four compartments.\n\nUnlike the average human being who has two sides only- a left and a right- the Nagual has a left side divided into two long sections, and a right side equally divided in two.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDuring our final session, he had us see people milling around a church. It was late afternoon, almost dark, yet the creatures inside their rigid, luminous cocoons radiated enough light to render everything around them crystal clear. The sight was wondrous.\n\nDon Juan explained that the egg-shaped shells which seemed so bright to us were indeed dull. The luminosity emanated from the brilliant core: The shell in fact dulled its radiance. Don Juan revealed to us that the shell must be broken in order to liberate that being. It must be broken from the inside at the right time, just as creatures that hatch out of eggs break their shells. If they fail to do so, they suffocate and die. As with creatures that hatch out of eggs, there is no way for a warrior to break the shell of his luminosity until the time is right.\n\nDon Juan told us that losing the human form was the only means of breaking that shell, the only means of liberating that haunting luminous core; the core of awareness which is the Eagle's food. To break the shell means remembering the other self, and arriving at the totality of oneself.\n\nDon Juan and his warriors did arrive at the totality of themselves, and turned then to their last task, which was to find a new pair of double beings.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHe told me that he was going to reveal to me a practical maneuver of the second attention, and right then he turned into a luminous egg. He reverted back to his normal appearance and repeated this transformation three or four more times. I understood perfectly well what he was doing. He did not need to explain it to me, and yet I could not put into words what I knew.\n\nSilvio Manuel smiled, cognizant of my problem. He said that it took an enormity of strength to let go of the intent of everyday life. The secret that he had just revealed was how to expedite letting go of that intent. In order to do what he had done, one must place one's attention on the luminous shell.\n\nHe turned one more time into a luminous egg and then it became obvious to me what I had known all along. Silvio Manuel's eyes turned for an instant to focus on the point of the second attention. His head was straight, as if he had been looking ahead of him, only his eyes were askew. He said that a warrior must evoke intent. The glance is the secret. The eyes beckon intent.\n\nI became euphoric at that point. I was at long last capable of thinking about something I knew without really knowing. The reason why seeing seems to be visual is because we need the eyes to focus on intent. Don Juan and his party of warriors knew how to use their eyes to catch another aspect of intent and called this act seeing. What Silvio Manuel had shown me was the true function of the eyes; the catchers of intent.\n\nI then used my eyes deliberately to beckon intent. I focused them on the point of the second attention. All of a sudden don Juan, his warriors, dona Soledad, and Eligio were luminous eggs; but not la Gorda, the three little sisters, and the Genaros. I kept on moving my eyes back and forth between the blobs of light and the people until I heard a crack in the base of my neck, and then everybody in the room was a luminous egg.\n\nI felt for an instant that I could not tell them apart, but then my eyes seemed to adjust and I held two aspects of intent; two images at once. I could see their physical bodies and also their luminosities.\n\nThe two scenes were not superimposed on each other. They were separate, and yet I could not figure out how. I definitely had two channels of vision, and seeing had everything to do with my eyes, and yet was independent of them. I could still see the luminous eggs, but not their physical bodies when I closed my eyes.\n\nI had at one moment the clearest sensation that I knew how to shift my attention to my luminosity. I also knew that to revert to the physical level all I had to do was to focus my eyes on my body.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"Genaro has something to tell you,\" don Juan said. \"I've told you that he is the master of awareness. Now I can tell you what all that means. He can make the assemblage point move deeper into the luminous egg after that point has been jolted out of its position by the nagual's blow.\"\n\nHe explained that Genaro had pushed my assemblage point countless times after I had attained heightened awareness. The day we had gone to the gigantic flat rock to talk, Genaro had made my assemblage point move dramatically into the left side- so dramatically, in fact, that it had been a bit dangerous.\n\nDon Juan stopped talking and seemed to be ready to give Genaro the spotlight. He nodded as if to signal Genaro to say something. Genaro stood up and came to my side.\n\n\"Flame is very important,\" he said softly. \"Do you remember that day when I made you look at the reflection of the sunlight on a piece of quartz when we were sitting on that big flat rock?\"\n\nWhen Genaro mentioned it I remembered. On that day just after don Juan had stopped talking, Genaro had pointed to the refraction of light as it went through a piece of polished quartz that he had taken out of his pocket and placed on the flat rock. The shine of the quartz had immediately caught my attention. The next thing I knew, I was crouching on the flat rock as don Juan stood by with a worried look on his face.\n\nI was about to tell Genaro what I had remembered when he began to talk. He put his mouth to my ear and pointed to one of the two gasoline lamps in the room.\n\n\"Look at the flame,\" he said. \"There is no heat in it. It's pure flame. Pure flame can take you to the depths of the unknown.\"\n\nAs he talked, I began to feel a strange pressure. It was a physical heaviness. My ears were buzzing. My eyes teared to the point that I could hardly make out the shape of the furniture. My vision seemed to be totally out of focus.\n\nAlthough my eyes were open, I could not see the intense light of the gasoline lamps. Everything around me was dark. There were streaks of chartreuse phosphorescence that illuminated dark, moving clouds. Then, as abruptly as it had faded away, my eyesight returned.\n\nI could not make out where I was. I seemed to be floating like a balloon. I was alone. I had a pang of terror, and my reason rushed in to construct an explanation that made sense to me at that moment: Genaro had hypnotized me, using the flame of the gasoline lamp. I felt almost satisfied.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"What happens when the assemblage point moves outside the energy shape? Does it hang outside? Or is it attached to the luminous ball?\"\n\n\"It pushes the contours of the energy shape out, without breaking its energy boundaries.\"\n\nDon Juan explained that the end result of a movement of the assemblage point is a total change in the energy shape of a human being. Instead of a ball or an egg, he becomes something resembling a smoking pipe. The tip of the stem is the assemblage point, and the bowl of the pipe is what remains of the luminous ball. If the assemblage point keeps on moving, a moment comes when the luminous ball becomes a thin line of energy.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnother topic of don Juan's explanations was the indispensability of energetic uniformity and cohesion for the purpose of perceiving. His contention was that mankind perceives the world we know, in the terms we do, only because we share energetic uniformity and cohesion.\n\nHe said that we automatically attain these two conditions of energy in the course of our rearing and that they are so taken for granted we do not realize their vital importance until we are faced with the possibility of perceiving worlds other than the world we know. At those moments, it becomes evident that we need a new appropriate energetic uniformity and cohesion to perceive coherently and totally.\n\nI asked him what uniformity and cohesion were, and he explained that man's energetic shape has uniformity in the sense that every human being on earth has the form of a ball or an egg. And the fact that man's energy holds itself together as a ball or an egg proves it has cohesion.\n\nHe said that an example of a new uniformity and cohesion was the old sorcerers' energetic shape when it became a line: every one of them uniformly became a line and cohesively remained a line. Uniformity and cohesion at a line level permitted those old sorcerers to perceive a homogeneous new world.\n\n\"How are uniformity and cohesion acquired?\" I asked.\n\n\"The key is the position of the assemblage point, or rather the fixation of the assemblage point,\" he said.\n\nHe did not want to elaborate any further at that time, so I asked him if those old sorcerers could have reverted to being egglike. He replied that at one point they could have, but that they did not. And then the line cohesion set in and made it impossible for them to go back.\n\nHe believed that what really crystallized that line cohesion and prevented them from making the journey back was a matter of choice and greed. The scope of what those sorcerers were able to perceive and do as lines of energy was astronomically greater than what an average man or any average sorcerer can do or perceive.\n\nHe explained that the human domain when one is an energy ball is whatever energy filaments pass through the space within the ball's boundaries. Normally, we perceive not all the human domain but perhaps only one thousandth of it.\n\nHe was of the opinion that, if we take this into consideration, the enormity of what the old sorcerers did becomes apparent. They extended themselves into a line a thousand times the size of a man as an energy ball and perceived all the energy filaments that passed through that line.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhat's it all mean?\n\nBeats me.\n\nBut that egg salad turned out tasty!\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Weird Egg Stuff", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ywgnxyxv3ud71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 162, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ywgnxyxv3ud71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a6a347ab85ae1cb56dbe67868ee4a1c9c222fca"}, {"y": 324, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ywgnxyxv3ud71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af2a5f0d00f47ec02cee154bd3fbec2c9bb50071"}, {"y": 480, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ywgnxyxv3ud71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03f5ba57fb652a245beeae3c932413cc473f5a6c"}, {"y": 960, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ywgnxyxv3ud71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06ba875b3a936931f8445f3469d5e526b139b360"}], "s": {"y": 1050, "x": 700, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ywgnxyxv3ud71.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fcd42c486d3e580c1e54f96ffa71fa747424071"}, "id": "ywgnxyxv3ud71"}}, "name": "t3_osx6kw", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ADjgoGUfRAcAR87UUbc9xFB0ItryKfujD1EEDTPm1oI.jpg", "edited": 1627427326.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1627426149.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ywgnxyxv3ud71.jpg?width=700&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1fcd42c486d3e580c1e54f96ffa71fa747424071\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ywgnxyxv3ud71.jpg?width=700&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1fcd42c486d3e580c1e54f96ffa71fa747424071&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had a plan for his private classes, and he didn&amp;#39;t want them getting distracted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He made the process of learning sorcery understandable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just had to follow his instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(no one did).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honored not reading the books as he advised us.

He seemed to be enjoying himself immensely. He rested his head on my shoulder as if it were a heavy object he could no longer support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The reason we called him the Nagual,&amp;quot; Nestor went on, &amp;quot;is because he was split in two. In other words, any time he needed to, he could get into another track that we don&amp;#39;t have ourselves. Something would come out of him; something that was not a double, but a horrendous, menacing shape that looked like him but was twice his size. We call that shape the nagual and anybody who has it is, of course, the Nagual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Nagual told us that all of us can have that shape coming out of our heads if we wanted to, but chances are that none of us would want to. Genaro didn&amp;#39;t want it, so I think we don&amp;#39;t want it, either. So it appears that you&amp;#39;re the one who&amp;#39;s stuck with it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They cackled and yelled as if they were corralling a herd of cattle. Benigno put his arms around my shoulders without opening his eyes and laughed until tears were rolling down his cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why do you say that I am stuck with it?&amp;quot; I asked Nestor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It takes too much energy,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;too much work. I don&amp;#39;t know how you can still be standing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Nagual and Genaro split you once in the eucalyptus grove. They took you there because eucalyptuses are your trees. I was there myself and I witnessed when they split you and pulled your nagual out. They pulled you apart by the ears until they had split your luminosity and you were not an egg anymore, but two long chunks of luminosity. Then they put you together again, but any sorcerer that sees can tell that there is a huge gap in the middle.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the advantage of being split?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You have one ear that hears everything and one eye that sees everything and you will always be able to go an extra mile in a moment of need. That splitting is also the reason why they told us that you are the Maestro.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They tried to split Pablito but it looks like it failed. He&amp;#39;s too pampered and has always indulged like a bastard. That&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s so screwed up now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sat on the bench later that night. I had refrained from talking about what happened to us until we had a chance to sit there. La Gorda was at first unwilling to say anything. My mind was in a peculiar state of exhilaration. I had had similar moments with don Juan, but they were associated, as a rule, with the aftereffects of hallucinogenic plants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began by describing to la Gorda what I had seen. The feature of those luminous eggs that had impressed me the most was their movements. They did not walk. They moved in a floating manner, yet they were grounded. The way they moved was not pleasing. Their movements were stilted, wooden, and jerky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When they were in motion the whole egg shape became smaller and rounder. They seemed to jump or jerk, or shake up and down with great speed. The result was a most annoying nervous shivering. Perhaps the closest I can get to describing the physical discomfort caused by their motion would be to say that I felt as if the images on a moving picture screen had been speeded up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing that had intrigued me was that I could not detect any legs. I had once seen a ballet production in which the dancers mimicked the movement of soldiers on ice skates. For that effect, they wore loose tunics that hung all the way to the floor. There was no way to see their feet, thus the illusion that they were gliding on ice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The luminous eggs that paraded in front of me gave the impression that they were sliding on a rough surface. Their luminosity shook up and down almost imperceptibly, yet enough to make me nearly ill. When the eggs were in repose they became elongated. Some of them were so long and rigid that they brought to mind the idea of a wooden icon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another even more disturbing feature of the luminous eggs was the absence of eyes. I had never realized so acutely how we are drawn to the eyes of living beings. The luminous eggs were thoroughly alive. They were observing me with great curiosity. I could see them jerking up and down; leaning over to watch me, but without any eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of those luminous eggs had black spots on them, huge spots below the midsection. Others did not. La Gorda had told me that reproduction affects the bodies of both men and women by causing a hole to appear below the stomach, but the spots on those luminous eggs did not seem like holes to me. They were areas with no luminosity, but there was no depth to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those that had the black spots seemed to be mellow, tired. The crest of their egg shape was wilted. It looked opaque in comparison to the rest of their glow. The ones without spots, on the other hand, were dazzlingly bright. I fancied them to be dangerous. They were vibrant; filled with energy and whiteness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;La Gorda said that the instant I rested my head on her she also entered into a state that resembled dreaming. She was awake, yet she could not move. She was conscious that people were milling around us. Then she saw them turning into luminous blobs and finally into egg-shaped creatures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did not know that I was also seeing. She had thought at first that I was watching over her, but at one moment the pressure of my head was so heavy that she concluded quite consciously that I too must have been seeing. Only after I straightened up and caught the young man fondling her as she seemed to sleep, did I have an inkling of what might be happening to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our visions differed in that she could distinguish men from women by the shape of some filaments that she called &amp;#39;roots&amp;#39;. Women, she said, had thick bundles of filaments that resembled a lion&amp;#39;s tail. They grew inward from the place of the genitalia. She explained that those roots were the givers of life. The embryo, in order to accomplish its growth, attaches itself to one of those nurturing roots and thoroughly consumes it, leaving only a hole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men, on the other hand, had short filaments that were alive and floating almost separately from the luminous mass of their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is only from the Eagle&amp;#39;s actions that a seer can tell what it wants. The Eagle, although it is not moved by the circumstances of any living thing, has granted a gift to each of those beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In those beings&amp;#39; own way, and by right, any one of them, if it so desires, has the power to keep the flame of awareness; the power to disobey the summons to &amp;#39;die and be consumed&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every living thing has been granted the power, if it so desires, to seek an opening to freedom and to go through it. It is evident to the seer who sees the opening, and to the creatures that go through it, that the Eagle has granted that gift in order to perpetuate awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of guiding living things to that opening, the Eagle created the Nagual. The Nagual is a double being to whom the rule has been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether the Nagual be in the form of a human being, an animal, a plant, or anything else that lives; the Nagual by virtue of its doubleness is drawn to seek that hidden passageway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In human beings, the Nagual comes in pairs; male and female. A double man and a double woman become the Nagual only after the rule has been told to each of them, and each of them has understood it and accepted it in full.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the eye of the seer, a Nagual man or Nagual woman appears as a luminous egg with four compartments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike the average human being who has two sides only- a left and a right- the Nagual has a left side divided into two long sections, and a right side equally divided in two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During our final session, he had us see people milling around a church. It was late afternoon, almost dark, yet the creatures inside their rigid, luminous cocoons radiated enough light to render everything around them crystal clear. The sight was wondrous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan explained that the egg-shaped shells which seemed so bright to us were indeed dull. The luminosity emanated from the brilliant core: The shell in fact dulled its radiance. Don Juan revealed to us that the shell must be broken in order to liberate that being. It must be broken from the inside at the right time, just as creatures that hatch out of eggs break their shells. If they fail to do so, they suffocate and die. As with creatures that hatch out of eggs, there is no way for a warrior to break the shell of his luminosity until the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan told us that losing the human form was the only means of breaking that shell, the only means of liberating that haunting luminous core; the core of awareness which is the Eagle&amp;#39;s food. To break the shell means remembering the other self, and arriving at the totality of oneself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan and his warriors did arrive at the totality of themselves, and turned then to their last task, which was to find a new pair of double beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me that he was going to reveal to me a practical maneuver of the second attention, and right then he turned into a luminous egg. He reverted back to his normal appearance and repeated this transformation three or four more times. I understood perfectly well what he was doing. He did not need to explain it to me, and yet I could not put into words what I knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silvio Manuel smiled, cognizant of my problem. He said that it took an enormity of strength to let go of the intent of everyday life. The secret that he had just revealed was how to expedite letting go of that intent. In order to do what he had done, one must place one&amp;#39;s attention on the luminous shell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He turned one more time into a luminous egg and then it became obvious to me what I had known all along. Silvio Manuel&amp;#39;s eyes turned for an instant to focus on the point of the second attention. His head was straight, as if he had been looking ahead of him, only his eyes were askew. He said that a warrior must evoke intent. The glance is the secret. The eyes beckon intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I became euphoric at that point. I was at long last capable of thinking about something I knew without really knowing. The reason why seeing seems to be visual is because we need the eyes to focus on intent. Don Juan and his party of warriors knew how to use their eyes to catch another aspect of intent and called this act seeing. What Silvio Manuel had shown me was the true function of the eyes; the catchers of intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then used my eyes deliberately to beckon intent. I focused them on the point of the second attention. All of a sudden don Juan, his warriors, dona Soledad, and Eligio were luminous eggs; but not la Gorda, the three little sisters, and the Genaros. I kept on moving my eyes back and forth between the blobs of light and the people until I heard a crack in the base of my neck, and then everybody in the room was a luminous egg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt for an instant that I could not tell them apart, but then my eyes seemed to adjust and I held two aspects of intent; two images at once. I could see their physical bodies and also their luminosities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two scenes were not superimposed on each other. They were separate, and yet I could not figure out how. I definitely had two channels of vision, and seeing had everything to do with my eyes, and yet was independent of them. I could still see the luminous eggs, but not their physical bodies when I closed my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had at one moment the clearest sensation that I knew how to shift my attention to my luminosity. I also knew that to revert to the physical level all I had to do was to focus my eyes on my body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Genaro has something to tell you,&amp;quot; don Juan said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve told you that he is the master of awareness. Now I can tell you what all that means. He can make the assemblage point move deeper into the luminous egg after that point has been jolted out of its position by the nagual&amp;#39;s blow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He explained that Genaro had pushed my assemblage point countless times after I had attained heightened awareness. The day we had gone to the gigantic flat rock to talk, Genaro had made my assemblage point move dramatically into the left side- so dramatically, in fact, that it had been a bit dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan stopped talking and seemed to be ready to give Genaro the spotlight. He nodded as if to signal Genaro to say something. Genaro stood up and came to my side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Flame is very important,&amp;quot; he said softly. &amp;quot;Do you remember that day when I made you look at the reflection of the sunlight on a piece of quartz when we were sitting on that big flat rock?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Genaro mentioned it I remembered. On that day just after don Juan had stopped talking, Genaro had pointed to the refraction of light as it went through a piece of polished quartz that he had taken out of his pocket and placed on the flat rock. The shine of the quartz had immediately caught my attention. The next thing I knew, I was crouching on the flat rock as don Juan stood by with a worried look on his face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was about to tell Genaro what I had remembered when he began to talk. He put his mouth to my ear and pointed to one of the two gasoline lamps in the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Look at the flame,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;There is no heat in it. It&amp;#39;s pure flame. Pure flame can take you to the depths of the unknown.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As he talked, I began to feel a strange pressure. It was a physical heaviness. My ears were buzzing. My eyes teared to the point that I could hardly make out the shape of the furniture. My vision seemed to be totally out of focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although my eyes were open, I could not see the intense light of the gasoline lamps. Everything around me was dark. There were streaks of chartreuse phosphorescence that illuminated dark, moving clouds. Then, as abruptly as it had faded away, my eyesight returned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could not make out where I was. I seemed to be floating like a balloon. I was alone. I had a pang of terror, and my reason rushed in to construct an explanation that made sense to me at that moment: Genaro had hypnotized me, using the flame of the gasoline lamp. I felt almost satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What happens when the assemblage point moves outside the energy shape? Does it hang outside? Or is it attached to the luminous ball?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It pushes the contours of the energy shape out, without breaking its energy boundaries.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan explained that the end result of a movement of the assemblage point is a total change in the energy shape of a human being. Instead of a ball or an egg, he becomes something resembling a smoking pipe. The tip of the stem is the assemblage point, and the bowl of the pipe is what remains of the luminous ball. If the assemblage point keeps on moving, a moment comes when the luminous ball becomes a thin line of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another topic of don Juan&amp;#39;s explanations was the indispensability of energetic uniformity and cohesion for the purpose of perceiving. His contention was that mankind perceives the world we know, in the terms we do, only because we share energetic uniformity and cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that we automatically attain these two conditions of energy in the course of our rearing and that they are so taken for granted we do not realize their vital importance until we are faced with the possibility of perceiving worlds other than the world we know. At those moments, it becomes evident that we need a new appropriate energetic uniformity and cohesion to perceive coherently and totally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked him what uniformity and cohesion were, and he explained that man&amp;#39;s energetic shape has uniformity in the sense that every human being on earth has the form of a ball or an egg. And the fact that man&amp;#39;s energy holds itself together as a ball or an egg proves it has cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that an example of a new uniformity and cohesion was the old sorcerers&amp;#39; energetic shape when it became a line: every one of them uniformly became a line and cohesively remained a line. Uniformity and cohesion at a line level permitted those old sorcerers to perceive a homogeneous new world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How are uniformity and cohesion acquired?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The key is the position of the assemblage point, or rather the fixation of the assemblage point,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did not want to elaborate any further at that time, so I asked him if those old sorcerers could have reverted to being egglike. He replied that at one point they could have, but that they did not. And then the line cohesion set in and made it impossible for them to go back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He believed that what really crystallized that line cohesion and prevented them from making the journey back was a matter of choice and greed. The scope of what those sorcerers were able to perceive and do as lines of energy was astronomically greater than what an average man or any average sorcerer can do or perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He explained that the human domain when one is an energy ball is whatever energy filaments pass through the space within the ball&amp;#39;s boundaries. Normally, we perceive not all the human domain but perhaps only one thousandth of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was of the opinion that, if we take this into consideration, the enormity of what the old sorcerers did becomes apparent. They extended themselves into a line a thousand times the size of a man as an energy ball and perceived all the energy filaments that passed through that line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s it all mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beats me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that egg salad turned out tasty!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false,

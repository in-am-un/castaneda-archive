I'm all for it.\n\nTrouble is, you guys don't know any shamanism.  But that's an argument for a different crowd.\n\nNew people might gain from this picture.\n\nWe try to get you to do \"darkroom\" because we want a giant demon to swallow you whole, while you scream in terror.\n\nJust trying to do what's best for you!\n\nBut some of you are reluctant (you have trust issues), so here's an alternative.\n\nThe demon isn't going to show up, until you remove all words from your mind.

A very bad place to be. But we're stuck there.\n\nWe live on the bad end of town.\n\nAnd worse, we've been hanging out at the bar.  And going nowhere else.\n\nWe're trying to get you out of the bar, so you can sober up.\n\nYou're wallowing at the bar stool, when you think about \"ME\".\n\nWhen you think of yourself as a separate object, a victim of all the nasty people around you, who want to keep you down.\n\nThe Man!  The Man is keeping you down!\n\nSo you sit at the bar, feeling sorry for yourself, forever.\n\nWhat we want, is for you to stop thinking about that.\n\nThink about flowers!  Flying moths.\n\nThink about all the weird stuff you ignore, like those little worms that float around in your vision.\n\nAnd why do brilliant dots bloom in front of your very eyes, when you gaze off at the bright sky.\n\nI'm sure some biologist has an explanation, but that's a sight you've been ignoring.\n\nTry to stop thinking about all of your troubles, all of the things trying to attack you (\"ME\"), and give it a rest.\n\nEnjoy the sights that you rarely pay attention to.\n\nYou can in fact, become an honest to goodness sorcerer with this technique alone.\n\nBut it's highly unlikely.\n\nThose who are actively doing darkroom, will find it VERY useful.\n\nIn the past I said, \"Get rid of the internal dialogue.  Force it off!\"\n\nBut then, you have to seek out images in the mind, and get rid of those!\n\nThose cause the internal dialogue to come back.\n\nUsing those 2 techniques I can sit on the edge of my bed, gaze right through the ceiling, and out into the stars.\n\nI can use my fingers to \"zoom in\", like the scene was a cellphone pic.\n\nI can select a planet, and then gaze at it.\n\nBut I can't \"Leap\" off the bed, zoom through space, and land there.\n\n(Yep, it hurts a bit when you touch down.)\n\nFor that, I need to \"forget who I am\".\n\nSo:\n\n1 Silence\n\n2 No images in mind\n\n3 Forget who you are\n\nBut with this technique, shown in this picture, and GREATLY EMPHASIZED by Carlos and the witches, you can combine the last 2.\n\nHow did we forget about this one?\n\nI suppose it seems too mysterious.  Or maybe too judgmental.\n\nIt has a \"foul odor\" when you hear about it.  You're accusing us of What???  Of being stuck between our toes?\n\nWhat does that even mean Carlos???!!?\n\nWe just couldn't get it.  Private lessons from Carlos, seemed like one episode of Gilligan's Island after another.  Same idiocy, completely different reason they never get off the island.\n\nAnd we didn't.  We were stranded on the Island of the Tonal, with nothing but Mary Ann to look at.

Then you'll know,  everything in Olmec Shamanism flows from the very same thing.\n\nSo we didn't do our homework back in the 90s to learn that, but we can fix that now.\n\nAnd this picture can help.\n\nSomeone commented it looks like that man is pissing on the floor.\n\nI did my best to avoid that with careful positioning of the awareness beam.

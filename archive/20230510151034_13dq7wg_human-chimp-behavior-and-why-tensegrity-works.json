So don't anyone think this post implies we're made of physical matter.  \n\n\nPhysical matter, along with time and space, are illusions created by always hanging out in the same realms.  \n\n\nWhen created, were were around 16 soccer sized puffs of awareness, stuffed into a container.  \n\n\nWe say \"egg shape\", but it's pliable. The shape seems to be a result of how you use the awareness you were given.  \n\n\nFor example, in Stellar Hatch you gaze down 2 stories below the floor, and thereby stretch your egg down the distance of a tree's roots.  \n\n\nA technique the old seers used, to live thousands of years as trees.  \n\n\nThe fruit trees don Juan had at his compound, were old seers who had done that.  \n\n\nDon Juan and his lineage seemed to have a hobby of rescuing old seers.  \n\n\nManfred was another, and the death defier had been around that lineage for more than 250 years out of the lineages history following the old seers decision to form into lineages back in the 16th century.  \n\n\nCarlos continued the rescue tradition by taking in the death defier, and the blue scout.  \n\n\nSo while the lineages rejected the standard \"family is everything\" lifestyle, they were still very compassionate about helping others.  \n\n\nI have to wonder if that isn't because of the women in the lineages, more than the men.  \n\n\nKeep in mind, while we started as 16 balls of awareness we noticed this particular reality on earth, began to understand how it works, and then lingered a bit too long in the only \"container\" we could find available here.  \n\n\nThe womb of a female.  \n\n\nWe were still in our original egg outside time and space.  \n\n\nAnd don't ask me how that works.  \n\n\nBut within this \"realm\", we had to exist in a specific location and time period.  \n\n\nAnd you WILL get to visibly see this for yourself.  \n\n\nThere aren't any theories in sorcery!  \n\n\nTheories are for stealing from others, based on lame arguments.  \n\n\nSorcerers have only real observations of what Carlos liked to call, \"energetic facts\".  \n\n\nAnd if you are serious, you'll perceive those too.  \n\n\nSo we took births out of curiosity, and half of those soccer balls got stuck in a growing flesh body.  \n\n\nOne descendant from Apes.  \n\n\nWhich meant, the half of our awareness trapped in flesh picked up the habits of that container.  \n\n\nWe learned all the things children have to learn, to survive in physical bodies.  \n\n\nAnd developed an imaginary idea of what we are, and how it relates to those around us.  \n\n\nA self-pity filled view these days since our entire society is encased in rooms, living off agriculture, using money to acquire things.  \n\n\nWe don't explore the unknown anymore, which has driven us mad.  \n\n\nSorcerers resume that exploration, despite being half encased in flesh.  \n\n\nLuckily we have half that isn't, and that's what runs around in dreams all night.  \n\n\nNew to this?  \n\n\nThen you should know, this is not a theory at all.  \n\n\nThat half of ourselves which runs around in dreams, is not limited to being around when our physical body is asleep.  \n\n\nThe main purpose of Tensegrity is to lure it into the waking world.  \n\n\nStanding right next to you.  \n\n\nAnd you'll get to see that too!  \n\n\nAgain, there are no \"theories\" in sorcery. Just facts.  \n\n\nThat \"double\" we have is far more important to sorcery than beginners realize.  \n\n\nTo do the super cool things sorcerers do, such as leap across space to land outside our galaxy, is done in your double.  \n\n\nI didn't say asleep.  \n\n\nI didn't mention that your physical body goes limp, and you imagine the whole thing.  \n\n\nInstead, you simply do the impossible.  \n\n\nAnd at some point your double takes over, and your physical body \"shrinks\" to next to nothing.  \n\n\nWhile walking as normal, with your eyes open.  \n\n\nAs Carlos did at the ticket office.  \n\n\nDon Juan forced his tonal to shrink by giving him a shove at just the right movement, and Carlos teleported a mile away.  \n\n\nTo next sunday!  \n\n\nOr was it last sunday?  \n\n\nCarlos never figured it out. But he knew it had to be on the weekend, because of the coin stands set up on a busy road. During the week days, where he started before the shove, the coin stands are not set up where he landed.  \n\n\nHe relocated both in time, and space. And found a real person at the coin stand, who didn't realize they were in some kind of alternate time line. Or perhaps they weren't.  \n\n\nAnd just so we'd know he hadn't actually passed out on the ticket office floor and dreamed it all, the way those who practice meditation techniques do, Carlos walked all the way back to Alameda park.  \n\n\nFrom where he'd been teleported to.  \n\n\nAlso returning to the current time.  \n\n\nWith nothing indicating there was a \"change over\" on either side.  \n\n\nYou'll do that sort of thing! It's guaranteed if you follow instructions.  \n\n\nIt's my favorite activity! Doing the impossible.  \n\n\nOften with assistance by Cholita.  \n\n\nBut it likely gets even weirder than teleportation.  \n\n\nIn all of the times Carlos had met don Genaro, until it occurred to him to ask, don Genaro was in his double. All but two times out of the dozens we read about in the books.  \n\n\nAs most likely was don Juan!  \n\n\nTaisha's latest book takes place entirely in her double, in a phantom house with Zuleica's double.  \n\n\nRemember from the early books where don Juan warns Carlos never to reveal where the body of a sorcerer is located?  \n\n\nThere's a lot more to that warning than our community realizes, since you can't pretend to be in two places at once.  \n\n\nAnd unfortunately our community has fallen into 100% pretending. Out of greed.  \n\n\nLike all other magic systems.  \n\n\nSo we overlooked the coolest things in the books entirely, because we had no hope at all of doing those. And most were motivated by greed for money, or attention.  \n\n\nSo they never did any \"soul searching\" to figure out why after decades of interest, they were still clueless about sorcery.  \n\n\nExcept, we actually did have hope of doing them, if we'd only do actual work as specified by Carlos and the witches.  \n\n\nAnd the real thing is mind boggling!  \n\n\nBack to our chimps. They explain so much about what went wrong in the world of magic. Why none is left on earth, except that tiny bit we've recently managed to salvage, from the books of Carlos.  \n\n\nBeing Chimplike, Men have a serious disadvantage.  \n\n\nIn the world of apes, the males are obsessed with power over others.  \n\n\nThe female chimps are better balanced. And since they're hanging out with male chimps who are much stronger, the women are sneakier.  \n\n\nAnd observe more.  \n\n\nA male chimp will attempt to break into a place he wants to go, using force.  \n\n\nA female chimp will look for side entrances, or evaluate whether it's even worth going into there.  \n\n\nAt night women can lay on their back and focus their attention on their womb. Silence their thoughts, and drift far into sorcery realms.  \n\n\nWe got the J curve lecture Carlos gave us, from two new women sneaking in side entrances in the second attention.  \n\n\nMen cannot do that. Drift around looking at the overall picture, and for secret paths to take.  \n\n\nThat's not to say, the men can't drift while laying on their back with their eyes closed.  \n\n\nBut they drift into pretending so they can dominate other men with their fake \"tales of power\".  \n\n\nOf pretend magic like \"Astral Travel\".  \n\n\nOr \"higher states of consciousness\".  \n\n\nAll pretending, based on meager \"shamanic drumming\" effects.  \n\n\nSo men need to take a different path and not close their eyes, or lay inactive for too long.  \n\n\nSomething that cannot be pretended, so that they can't become obsessed with chest beating to frighten and dominate the other chimps.  \n\n\nDarkroom is excellent for that, but any of the techniques in the books can be \"adjusted\" to make lying to yourself impossible.  \n\n\nRecapitulation for example, works great as long as you INSIST on mind boggling magic while you are doing it. Like you read in the books.  \n\n\nBut everyone just ignores that nasty little detail. That recap done correctly leads to intense and unbelievable magic.  \n\n\nI hope to fix that some day by animating what the real thing looks like.  \n\n\nMeanwhile \"darkroom\" was designed by the allies of Carlos, so that's what we have for now.  \n\n\nBut other real paths are always welcome!  \n\n\nMen use darkroom to explore other realms, running into obstacles along the way which they have to overcome with deeper silence, and physical tensegrity exercises.  \n\n\nThey're \"on the prowl\" looking for amazing magical sights.  \n\n\nI've never understood why, but women are not nearly as obsessed with that as men.  \n\n\nOr perhaps, they aren't as obsessed with outdoing rivals, and notice the more \"subtle\" aspects of Tensegrity.  \n\n\nTouch, smell, heat, cold.  \n\n\nOur other physical senses are all subject to sorcery states.  \n\n\nYou can teleport, only in your feelings if you so choose.  \n\n\nCarlos could have been shoved through that ticket office, only in \"feelings\".  \n\n\nAs a male my reaction is, \"that doesn't count!\".  \n\n\nYou have to SEE it visually for it to be \"real\".  \n\n\nBut that's not true for women.  \n\n\nThey like to watch too!  \n\n\nBut not nearly as much as the men. Because they can perceive all of the other senses being affected by magic.  \n\n\nAnd they can perceive what's helping them with that.  \n\n\nThe men by nature, don't look hard for \"help\".  \n\n\nIn a chimp society, if you hope to lead you have to dominate everyone.  \n\n\nYou can afford a \"helper\" or two. It never hurts to have public opinion on your side.  \n\n\nBut beyond one or two friend male chimps to lend you more muscle, the male chimps want to pretend it's all them.  \n\n\nDoing everything. They have a need to be impressive.  \n\n\nThe female chimps not so much. They take it all in and look for what suits them.  \n\n\nVisual information, but also all other sensory input.  \n\n\nThe witches use the analogy of a funnel.  \n\n\nWomen have the wide end of the funnel pointed outward, sucking up as much information as it can and beaming it into their perception.  \n\n\nMen have the wide part of the funnel stuck over their face blocking out all else but their own desires, and are trying to stare though the small part to see how to bring those desires into being.  \n\n\nSo they \"zero in\" on things better than the women, at the loss of understanding the context.  \n\n\nThis is VERY obvious when doing tensegrity.  \n\n\nThe women will pick up all of the sensations created by the movements, and look at the overall picture of what produces interesting results.  \n\n\nCholita tried to send a message to me the other day, by leaving the tensegrity book open to a specific pass with a comment she wrote on the side.  \n\n\nI failed to take a picture of that display as I quickly walked by it while coming home, worried Cholita would attack me if I lingered.  \n\n\nI should have stopped to take a picture!  \n\n\nBut it looked like the pass where you kick yourself in the butt.  \n\n\nA remedy for my own obsession with the visual?!  \n\n\nAt the end of the path of the J curve, a fortunate thing happens.  \n\n\nThe emanations themselves become visible.  \n\n\nAnd then the men, now noticing the benefits of gazing overall instead of concentrating, become more like the women.  \n\n\nLooking overall, for \"advantages\".  \n\n\nIn the end, the path of men meets the path of women.  \n\n\nLast night out there I \"saw\" that you can in fact seek help from the spirit. And that as witches women have always done that, but men have to learn.  \n\n\nAnd that visible tensegrity magic isn't nearly as important for the women. They can find the magic in senses which are not aided by darkness.  \n\n\nSo the problem men have, is tunnel vision.  \n\n\nBut the problem women have, is finding time to practice. And not being distracted from the only goal you can have, if you want to be like the old seers.  \n\n\nI wish I could animate this. There's more to it than can be stated with words.  \n\n\nAnd it explains why the main audience for Cleargreen Tensegrity, is female.  \n\n\nBut for the men, try to focus on more senses than the visual. See if you can't tune in to \"muscle memory\" which is more driven by sensation than sight.  \n\n\nWHERE YOU FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION, is the strongest determiner of where your assemblage point moves.  \n\n\nDarkroom practice advises you to look for \"puffs\" of intense colored light in darkness.  \n\n\nBut you can ALSO focus your attention in the sensations created when you move, and how your muscles give the commands to move.  \n\n\nThings men don't normally look at.  \n\n\nFor the women, just stay focused overall as you tend to do, and look for \"changes\".  \n\n\nDon't fall into treating tensegrity like a social event.  \n\n\nIf you practice Tensegrity to find a \"spiritual partner\", you're doomed.  \n\n\nBoth men and women have this in common: You have to travel very far, to get to the destination.  \n\n\nYou can never afford to stop and rest more than an instant. The path of sorcery is quite simply too long to allow stopping very often. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Human Chimp Behavior And Why Tensegrity Works", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"3kxt25yrg0za1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3kxt25yrg0za1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=246844cb75feaa796ef38f2014c555ae7ac9a3b8"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3kxt25yrg0za1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=901487d9065c70951130496793cd3d9386212c08"}, {"y": 241, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3kxt25yrg0za1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec7fb76db89f864260ed7af5806073e93fd162ba"}, {"y": 482, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3kxt25yrg0za1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9413671638a515a68319aa5ba79956ffc1f0ff20"}, {"y": 724, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3kxt25yrg0za1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37ec5be3364b2a41e2a83505946fd9caa2e767c2"}, {"y": 814, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3kxt25yrg0za1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2951c2f5c434c575c3245fbf892e6c182b32cf0"}], "s": {"y": 861, "x": 1141, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3kxt25yrg0za1.jpg?width=1141&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c50c3f57d848c4f42cefd18c3e3d5e62188c5b07"}, "id": "3kxt25yrg0za1"}}, "name": "t3_13dq7wg", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 44, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 44, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/B2IF0YPcKMgRRLb9mgR43eU-P6xaEsHWRNAMrqu5qbw.jpg", "edited": 1683738563.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1683724234.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3kxt25yrg0za1.jpg?width=1141&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c50c3f57d848c4f42cefd18c3e3d5e62188c5b07\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3kxt25yrg0za1.jpg?width=1141&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c50c3f57d848c4f42cefd18c3e3d5e62188c5b07&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We voluntarily took a birth in these bodies.

Out of greed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like all other magic systems.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we overlooked the coolest things in the books entirely, because we had no hope at all of doing those. And most were motivated by greed for money, or attention.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they never did any &amp;quot;soul searching&amp;quot; to figure out why after decades of interest, they were still clueless about sorcery.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, we actually did have hope of doing them, if we&amp;#39;d only do actual work as specified by Carlos and the witches.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the real thing is mind boggling!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to our chimps. They explain so much about what went wrong in the world of magic. Why none is left on earth, except that tiny bit we&amp;#39;ve recently managed to salvage, from the books of Carlos.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being Chimplike, Men have a serious disadvantage.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the world of apes, the males are obsessed with power over others.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The female chimps are better balanced. And since they&amp;#39;re hanging out with male chimps who are much stronger, the women are sneakier.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And observe more.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A male chimp will attempt to break into a place he wants to go, using force.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A female chimp will look for side entrances, or evaluate whether it&amp;#39;s even worth going into there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At night women can lay on their back and focus their attention on their womb. Silence their thoughts, and drift far into sorcery realms.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got the J curve lecture Carlos gave us, from two new women sneaking in side entrances in the second attention.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men cannot do that. Drift around looking at the overall picture, and for secret paths to take.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say, the men can&amp;#39;t drift while laying on their back with their eyes closed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they drift into pretending so they can dominate other men with their fake &amp;quot;tales of power&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of pretend magic like &amp;quot;Astral Travel&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or &amp;quot;higher states of consciousness&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All pretending, based on meager &amp;quot;shamanic drumming&amp;quot; effects.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So men need to take a different path and not close their eyes, or lay inactive for too long.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something that cannot be pretended, so that they can&amp;#39;t become obsessed with chest beating to frighten and dominate the other chimps.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darkroom is excellent for that, but any of the techniques in the books can be &amp;quot;adjusted&amp;quot; to make lying to yourself impossible.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recapitulation for example, works great as long as you INSIST on mind boggling magic while you are doing it. Like you read in the books.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But everyone just ignores that nasty little detail. That recap done correctly leads to intense and unbelievable magic.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope to fix that some day by animating what the real thing looks like.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile &amp;quot;darkroom&amp;quot; was designed by the allies of Carlos, so that&amp;#39;s what we have for now.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But other real paths are always welcome!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men use darkroom to explore other realms, running into obstacles along the way which they have to overcome with deeper silence, and physical tensegrity exercises.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;on the prowl&amp;quot; looking for amazing magical sights.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never understood why, but women are not nearly as obsessed with that as men.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps, they aren&amp;#39;t as obsessed with outdoing rivals, and notice the more &amp;quot;subtle&amp;quot; aspects of Tensegrity.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Touch, smell, heat, cold.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our other physical senses are all subject to sorcery states.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can teleport, only in your feelings if you so choose.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos could have been shoved through that ticket office, only in &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a male my reaction is, &amp;quot;that doesn&amp;#39;t count!&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to SEE it visually for it to be &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s not true for women.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They like to watch too!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not nearly as much as the men. Because they can perceive all of the other senses being affected by magic.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they can perceive what&amp;#39;s helping them with that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The men by nature, don&amp;#39;t look hard for &amp;quot;help&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a chimp society, if you hope to lead you have to dominate everyone.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can afford a &amp;quot;helper&amp;quot; or two. It never hurts to have public opinion on your side.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But beyond one or two friend male chimps to lend you more muscle, the male chimps want to pretend it&amp;#39;s all them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing everything. They have a need to be impressive.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The female chimps not so much. They take it all in and look for what suits them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Visual information, but also all other sensory input.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The witches use the analogy of a funnel.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women have the wide end of the funnel pointed outward, sucking up as much information as it can and beaming it into their perception.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men have the wide part of the funnel stuck over their face blocking out all else but their own desires, and are trying to stare though the small part to see how to bring those desires into being.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they &amp;quot;zero in&amp;quot; on things better than the women, at the loss of understanding the context.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is VERY obvious when doing tensegrity.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women will pick up all of the sensations created by the movements, and look at the overall picture of what produces interesting results.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita tried to send a message to me the other day, by leaving the tensegrity book open to a specific pass with a comment she wrote on the side.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I failed to take a picture of that display as I quickly walked by it while coming home, worried Cholita would attack me if I lingered.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should have stopped to take a picture!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it looked like the pass where you kick yourself in the butt.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A remedy for my own obsession with the visual?!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the path of the J curve, a fortunate thing happens.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The emanations themselves become visible.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then the men, now noticing the benefits of gazing overall instead of concentrating, become more like the women.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking overall, for &amp;quot;advantages&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, the path of men meets the path of women.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night out there I &amp;quot;saw&amp;quot; that you can in fact seek help from the spirit. And that as witches women have always done that, but men have to learn.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that visible tensegrity magic isn&amp;#39;t nearly as important for the women. They can find the magic in senses which are not aided by darkness.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the problem men have, is tunnel vision.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the problem women have, is finding time to practice. And not being distracted from the only goal you can have, if you want to be like the old seers.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could animate this. There&amp;#39;s more to it than can be stated with words.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it explains why the main audience for Cleargreen Tensegrity, is female.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for the men, try to focus on more senses than the visual. See if you can&amp;#39;t tune in to &amp;quot;muscle memory&amp;quot; which is more driven by sensation than sight.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WHERE YOU FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION, is the strongest determiner of where your assemblage point moves.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darkroom practice advises you to look for &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot; of intense colored light in darkness.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can ALSO focus your attention in the sensations created when you move, and how your muscles give the commands to move.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things men don&amp;#39;t normally look at.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the women, just stay focused overall as you tend to do, and look for &amp;quot;changes&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t fall into treating tensegrity like a social event.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you practice Tensegrity to find a &amp;quot;spiritual partner&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;re doomed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both men and women have this in common: You have to travel very far, to get to the destination.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can never afford to stop and rest more than an instant. The path of sorcery is quite simply too long to allow stopping very often. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "c812fe20-6005-11ea-a726-0e9c39b3b989", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "13dq7wg", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 21, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/13dq7wg/human_chimp_behavior_and_why_tensegrity_works/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/13dq7wg/human_chimp_behavior_and_why_tensegrity_works/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1683724234.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jjls9g5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1683727663.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_13dq7wg", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;growing flesh body.

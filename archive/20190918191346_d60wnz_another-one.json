Twice.\n\nHe said he was exhausted.\n\nI'm not sure of the cause of the tiredness, but probably it was from how he \"feels\" his way to silence. We all have different little body tricks going on, like the jaw gets tight, or tongue gets numb.  At first you have to force it, and that means something will be tense.\n\nMaybe that's the purpose of the rocks between your fingers, when forcing silence.\n\nTo keep the tension somewhere it won't be a problem, so you don't get tired from it.\n\nAt any rate, eventually your assemblage point will drift into full on heightened awareness, and you'll be completely alert and feel very good.\n\nHis description of the purple blob matches what several people  have told me.  But it isn't always the same way, so how it appears isn't as important as applying it to your body.\n\nHe also had to find just the right lighting level to get that to work. He didn't plan it, it just happened and he noticed it, so he took advantage.\n\nFrom there, he can learn to snatch inorganic beings, assemble other worlds, and jump into dreaming scenes, while fully awake.\n\nSo guys...   You aren't wasting your time.\n\nThat's one of the biggest barriers to learning.\n\nThe merchant mind.\n\nWhat's in it for me?  Why should I work so hard for something delusional?  Wouldn't watching Magnum PI reruns be more fun?\n\nYes, watch those too.  But keep practicing.\n\nHis first concern was, in order to scoop the purple onto his hand, he had to turn his head in sync. In other words, the purple blob seemed to be stuck to where his eyes were looking.\n\nJust thank your lucky stars for that!  Don't contrive that it's a problem.\n\nWhen the purple blobs eventually behave like real blobs of purple goo, meaning they stay put and you can look away,  you'll get goosebumps like you've never  had!  We should consider it kindness from *intent*, that it starts out seemingly as something you can write off as imaginary, if it gets too intense.\n\nRemember, the goosebumps are a sign of a rapidly shifting assemblage point. We're used to that only happening when something scares the dickens out of us.  So when it shifts, we automatically associate the energy released as being fear.\n\nDon Juan used to use that trick.  He'd use fright to shift Carlos' assemblage point.\n\nMaybe it's why Carlos' allies are so fearsome.  Because that's the fastest tool for shifting the assemblage point. Fright.\n\nWalking around with Cholita, especially when her energy body reaches out and I can actually see the strands, often causes me to worry that I'm about to pass out due to a serious illness I don't know about.\n\nAgain, it's from energy release due to a movement of the assemblage point to a position we're not used to.\n\nBut it feels like fright.\n\nIt's not.  You have to learn that slowly, over time.  I'm still learning it each day.\n\nWell, every other day, with Cholita keeping me so busy.\n\nIn the meantime if you're interested in learning about non-directionality,  go read up on the wall of fog. You'll see how Carlos had to stop it from rotating as he turned his head, in order to walk into it.\n\nThe colors being \"non-directional\" at first is perfectly normal.  I suspect that when we understand why this occurs, it won't be for any reason we would have guessed.\n\nIf you're in a hurry for the colors to become fully directional,  you can scoop some and rub it on your leg.  You'll still have to turn your head to keep it there at first (you won't later).  But the act of smearing it stretches it.  So now it has a different relationship to where your eyes are looking.\n\nYou'll also discover that moving your hands about can generate more purple smoke.  And then you'll notice \"dark energy\" waves.\n\nIt's all a progression.  It's scattered in the books.  Zuleica's seems to be the most complete progression.\n\nBut all of the tensegrity Carlos taught is filled with it.  I suspect there are techniques in old workshop notes, that are worth their weight in dark energy, and we just don't realize it yet.\n\nAlso, Carlos' basketball squish technique will cause the blobs of color to become more directional.  I suspect that's actually the main purpose of it.\n\nThat, and manifesting objects using *intent*.\n\nEdited: four times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Another One!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_d60wnz", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1568829768.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1568826826.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the people who writes to me was gazing at his fern yesterday, saw a puff of purple light, and realized it was his chance to scoop it with his hands, and place it on his body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did it!

We need more examples of various paths people can take.  From what you say, I guess you can learn to get silent but still not have the effects of Zuleica\u2019s technique.\n\nGotta have the fireworks!  It\u2019s just not satisfying without them.   \n\nBesides, people get annoyed when you tell them what you\u2019ve learned to do.  From their reactions, you learn how oppressive the dark magicians can be. \n\nThey\u2019ve pulled thick black hoods over the entire population.\n\nCarlos called it the \u201cchicken coop\u201d, and said if any chicken even sticks a toe out of the cage, the other chickens start pecking his head.  \n\nIf you want a good feel for that, go to a pet shop and find the cage filled with little birds.   Likely there\u2019s one being slowly murdered by constant pecking on his head.  The other birds get the munchies, once he has some scabs they can pick off.  They just mindlessly pick on him all day long.\n\nThat\u2019s our situation.\n\nI guess my emphasis on grabbing colors comes from private classes.  That's pretty much all we did, minus actually seeing them.  Carlos even showed us how to manifest things using them.   \n\nAnd on top of that, he had the blue scout paint what he saw. Or what she saw.  As he showed it to us, one of the women handed me a copy.  \n\nHe could have put up a giant sign post saying, \u201cJust play with those damned colors!\u201d and it wouldn\u2019t have been more obvious than all the tensegrity moves and lectures.\n\nThe goal of course, is to make the second attention's energy body more real.  \n\nIt does seem to be as real as anything. Cholita uses it all the time, and it\u2019s visible if you can get silent.   She\u2019s learned to block me, but when she gets distracted, she can\u2019t help herself.\n\nI can\u2019t guarantee it, but I do believe that if you learn to scoop colors, you're sure to attract an inorganic being.  I have one person who writes to me that is right on the verge of finding out.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t freak out and stop.  He\u2019s done that before.\n\nThe little dots I saw buzzing around on the floor at LAX last night, hoping Cholita actually took the flight she promised to take, were likely inorganic beings licking up energy left by the people coming down the escalator.\n\nThat\u2019s not the same as \u201cthe fliers\u201d, who sit right at your feet and lick.  According to Carlos that is. \n\nThese black dots are scavengers. They flit around, scooping up energy we discard.\n\nIf you *see* them, they even have a bug like face with huge eyes.\n\nCarlos mentioned discarded energy a couple of times in classes.  When people walk, little fibers of awareness drop off onto the floor.  Imagine \u201cpig pen\u201d from Charley Brown cartoons.\n\nThe tensegrity move, \u201cMashing energy\u201d makes it visible, if you can get silent in darkness.\n\nIf you practice scooping colors, and while doing it feel for cobwebs, than you could make a visit to the Forbidden City in Beijing, and find out about how people leave little trails of fibers as they walk.\n\nThe number of people emerging from a pedestrian underpass there, to visit the palace, is beyond counting.\n\nAs a result, you can stand where they walk and literally scoop up the energy they\u2019ve dropped.  It\u2019s completely palpable.  It feels like you just scooped up a handful of very tiny ants.\n\nThe Chacmools taught tensegrity moves to scoop it up, and pour it on yourself.\n\nThat\u2019s another thing you might try.

We need more examples of various paths people can take.  From what you say, I guess you can learn to get silent but still not have the effects of Zuleica\u2019s technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gotta have the fireworks!  It\u2019s just not satisfying without them.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides, people get annoyed when you tell them what you\u2019ve learned to do.  From their reactions, you learn how oppressive the dark magicians can be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They\u2019ve pulled thick black hoods over the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos called it the \u201cchicken coop\u201d, and said if any chicken even sticks a toe out of the cage, the other chickens start pecking his head.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want a good feel for that, go to a pet shop and find the cage filled with little birds.   Likely there\u2019s one being slowly murdered by constant pecking on his head.  The other birds get the munchies, once he has some scabs they can pick off.  They just mindlessly pick on him all day long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s our situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my emphasis on grabbing colors comes from private classes.  That&amp;#39;s pretty much all we did, minus actually seeing them.  Carlos even showed us how to manifest things using them.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And on top of that, he had the blue scout paint what he saw. Or what she saw.  As he showed it to us, one of the women handed me a copy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He could have put up a giant sign post saying, \u201cJust play with those damned colors!\u201d and it wouldn\u2019t have been more obvious than all the tensegrity moves and lectures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goal of course, is to make the second attention&amp;#39;s energy body more real.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It does seem to be as real as anything. Cholita uses it all the time, and it\u2019s visible if you can get silent.   She\u2019s learned to block me, but when she gets distracted, she can\u2019t help herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t guarantee it, but I do believe that if you learn to scoop colors, you&amp;#39;re sure to attract an inorganic being.  I have one person who writes to me that is right on the verge of finding out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he doesn\u2019t freak out and stop.  He\u2019s done that before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little dots I saw buzzing around on the floor at LAX last night, hoping Cholita actually took the flight she promised to take, were likely inorganic beings licking up energy left by the people coming down the escalator.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s not the same as \u201cthe fliers\u201d, who sit right at your feet and lick.  According to Carlos that is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These black dots are scavengers. They flit around, scooping up energy we discard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; them, they even have a bug like face with huge eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos mentioned discarded energy a couple of times in classes.  When people walk, little fibers of awareness drop off onto the floor.  Imagine \u201cpig pen\u201d from Charley Brown cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity move, \u201cMashing energy\u201d makes it visible, if you can get silent in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you practice scooping colors, and while doing it feel for cobwebs, than you could make a visit to the Forbidden City in Beijing, and find out about how people leave little trails of fibers as they walk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The number of people emerging from a pedestrian underpass there, to visit the palace, is beyond counting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, you can stand where they walk and literally scoop up the energy they\u2019ve dropped.  It\u2019s completely palpable.  It feels like you just scooped up a handful of very tiny ants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Chacmools taught tensegrity moves to scoop it up, and pour it on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s another thing you might try. Feeling to restore the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But be careful who you feel up.  When Cholita catches me moving my right hand near her waist, it\u2019s almost as bad as if I\u2019d lifted up her skirt!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last time I tried that, Cholita spaced out.

It&amp;#39;s a better place to put it, since men are more methodical and logical about their practice.  And maybe women only need to be given an example, and they can follow.  So the lent energy can benefit both of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll keep asking Cholita about what she was told.  It&amp;#39;s hard to keep her on topic.  Usually I have to say, &amp;quot;Cholita.  Cholita.  Stop.  Stop.

She was literally a gift from Carlos.\n\nAnd she\u2019ll kill herself if I don\u2019t.  \n\nIt's almost as if Carlos had planned it.\n\nAs an aside, I asked Cholita for some of her pictures from Vegas.  I told her some other followers of Carlos wanted to see them.\n\nShe got very upset, ranted about what a large body of work she has and that judging her based on a few pictures of people suffering in a casino isn\u2019t fair.\n\nI tried to explain, people are interested in seeing where a powerful dreamer focuses their attention.\n\nFinally she said, \u201cFuck you all!\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s kind of fun at times.  \n\nYesterday we went to Old Tustin, and Cholita found a very expensive clothing store.\n\nI wondered when she\u2019d get tired of new clothes, standing outside the dressing room. \n\nAnd she was angry just a few minutes before.  Like, really, really angry.  Screaming at the top of her lungs, with saliva flying out.\n\nNo man with an internal dialogue would have come out of it unscathed.  I\u2019m simply forced to be silent around her.\n\nBut she phases fairly quickly.  \n\nI was standing outside that dressing room, where Cholita had taken in at least 8 different things.\n\nI was hoping when she was done, she\u2019d be happy again.  And maybe show me what at least one of the outfits looked like before we bought it.\n\nI whispered through the curtain to her dressing room, did she have anything she could show me?\n\nI heard her say, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nThen Cholita pulled back the curtains to the dressing room so fast that I could hear the curtain hoops scraping on the metal pole.\n\nThere she was in very sexy shorts,  and a fancy bra covered in embroidered flowers.  With very little covered up.    \n\nCholita is a little old now, but she was amazing.\n\nShe walked out, and turned around like a professional model, so that I could see the whole effect.\n\nI gasped and pretended to faint onto the couch outside the dressing room.\n\nShe giggled and walked around the store like that, asking the other women if it looked good.   She\u2019d say, \u201cHey sweetie, doesn\u2019t this look great!\u201d, and insist on an answer.\n\nIt was inappropriate, but all the other women in the store had already figured out she was having issues.  And the store clerks were looking at their best customer in weeks. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine the chaos Carlos had going on, with so many women to manage.\n\nYou get a male apprentice, and you can practically tell them to sit in the corner and behave.  And they will.\n\nNot with women.  \n\nI also found out where Cholita\u2019s dark energy is coming from. I\u2019ve asked her over and over if she\u2019s aware of it. \n\nShe says yes every time, but she believes government agents have implanted a chip in her, or maybe it\u2019s all those microwave towers.  \n\nAs it turns out, Cholita has almost gone the necessary 7 years without men, to reach maximum energy levels.  She\u2019s right at the 6 mark. \n\nShe lost her husband that amount of time ago and as it turns out, she\u2019s rather picky about men.\n\nThat\u2019s where the dark energy is coming from.  \n\nI never really believed in the worms mentioned in Carlos\u2019 books.  It could be like the fliers.  Just a motivational myth.\n\nExcept that I\u2019ve seen the worms clearly, around 5 years ago.   And they were in women, not men.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t account for the huge amount of energy Cholita has.  When she focuses it on me, I can literally feel it like a burst of electricity in my stomach. It even comes with the sound of a transformer.\n\nShe uses it to reward men who please her. \n\nMaybe she\u2019s just a woman at full power.  From no sex.\n\nLater that night, driving 20 more miles to go to a store, hoping it wasn't closed yet, she began to say she wanted to go dancing.  But she had to get fucked afterwards.

Maybe an account will give an example of what it\u2019s good for.\n\nI\u2019d been forcing silence in darkness, but with Cholita around that\u2019s become very chaotic.  I don\u2019t get to do it most nights.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like I had a favorite place to visit down by the river, but a recent flood has scattered all the familiar things.\n\nMy room is filled with fragments of stuff made out of purple/blue light.\n\nHalf of a person\u2019s face, new landscapes I\u2019ve never seen on my walls, and odd sparkling lights.  And even stranger, I could see my footsteps when I walked. \n\nIt was the \"dark waves\" you can discover, using Zuleica's technique.  Each step left an echo in the shape of my foot, formed by dark waves.  It was as if the absolute darkness in the room had been disturbed a little by my second attention, making that a light source.\n\nBut the dark waves are so black, they can be seen over the noise.\n\nI practiced for a few hours in that mess, searching for my low energy inorganic.  I never found her.\n\nI did discover how Howard Lee's \"Light of Life\" technique works. I was bending backwards as far as I could go, with arms stretched to the sides.  My back became so arched that it was the same position as Howard uses when he teaches. So many lights began to sparkle above me, that I realized Howard must have learned to get silent, and discovered that position while doing his kungfu.  It releases energy.\n\nFinally I sat up on the bed, now in heightened awareness from searching in the second attention.  You can\u2019t waste any time if you watch the lights, even if you don\u2019t get what you were after.  You\u2019ll end up in heightened awareness all the same.\n\nAfter a while I noticed I was seeing the clearest image of a strange symbol.  I\u2019d been seeing it for a long time, but I was so silent that I didn\u2019t make anything out of it.  My eyes were fully open.  I wasn't dreaming. \n\nIt was there in my room, floating as a flat surface with a bright symbol.\n\nI casually lifted my thumb up to mark the spot.  I wasn't enthusiastic about moving my body, but I've made it a rule to mark unusual experiences.\n\nThe movement of my arm pushed me into the symbol. It sort of zoomed towards me, and I found my head bending down to look at it.\n\nI discovered it was a new tattoo that Cholita had gotten in Vegas.  She was showing it to me.  We'd been talking for a long time.\n\nSorcery gets weird the further you go.  And don Juan's warnings that sorcerers have to be impeccable or perish seems somewhat true, from what I can see of having Cholita around.

I don\u2019t get to do it most nights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s almost like I had a favorite place to visit down by the river, but a recent flood has scattered all the familiar things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My room is filled with fragments of stuff made out of purple/blue light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Half of a person\u2019s face, new landscapes I\u2019ve never seen on my walls, and odd sparkling lights.  And even stranger, I could see my footsteps when I walked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the &amp;quot;dark waves&amp;quot; you can discover, using Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique.  Each step left an echo in the shape of my foot, formed by dark waves.  It was as if the absolute darkness in the room had been disturbed a little by my second attention, making that a light source.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the dark waves are so black, they can be seen over the noise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I practiced for a few hours in that mess, searching for my low energy inorganic.  I never found her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did discover how Howard Lee&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Light of Life&amp;quot; technique works. I was bending backwards as far as I could go, with arms stretched to the sides.  My back became so arched that it was the same position as Howard uses when he teaches. So many lights began to sparkle above me, that I realized Howard must have learned to get silent, and discovered that position while doing his kungfu.  It releases energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally I sat up on the bed, now in heightened awareness from searching in the second attention.  You can\u2019t waste any time if you watch the lights, even if you don\u2019t get what you were after.  You\u2019ll end up in heightened awareness all the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a while I noticed I was seeing the clearest image of a strange symbol.  I\u2019d been seeing it for a long time, but I was so silent that I didn\u2019t make anything out of it.  My eyes were fully open.  I wasn&amp;#39;t dreaming. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was there in my room, floating as a flat surface with a bright symbol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I casually lifted my thumb up to mark the spot.  I wasn&amp;#39;t enthusiastic about moving my body, but I&amp;#39;ve made it a rule to mark unusual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movement of my arm pushed me into the symbol. It sort of zoomed towards me, and I found my head bending down to look at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I discovered it was a new tattoo that Cholita had gotten in Vegas.  She was showing it to me.  We&amp;#39;d been talking for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery gets weird the further you go.  And don Juan&amp;#39;s warnings that sorcerers have to be impeccable or perish seems somewhat true, from what I can see of having Cholita around.

I couldn't find him, but I found a smug N.Y. Times reporter chuckling over his movie about Carlos saying, \"The sorcerer was a fake, but the drugs were real!\"\n\nThat's what 20 years of lazy and delusional apprentices has brought us to.  Let's fix that soon!  Put down the drugs, pick up the silence stick.\n\nAs for seeing Carlos while awake, up close, I have no idea what it means.   I've also seen members of private classes and the Witches on rare occasions.  \n\nSeveral times I\u2019ve found myself in dreaming at some kind of workshop or group class setting. There's a small lake and buildings all around a park like setting.  The paths go up and down small hills covered in grass and landscaping.\n\nI can never tell if it\u2019s a memory, or a dream world. It happens something like once per several years. \n\nBut lately it's every night, that I get visitors from private classes.\n\nIt\u2019s Cholita.  She\u2019s scrambled me energetically.  \n\nThe main symptom is that my gazing at colors in darkness isn\u2019t tidy anymore.  Before I could just wait and a patch or two would float along.  They were around 6 inches to 2 feet in diameter, and distinct from the darkness.  Some had sharp edges, from which Carlos taught us to spin off text so we could \u201cread off the wall\u201d.\n\nAnd I could scoop the patches, because they were just about the right size to gather with the hand.  Most were perfectly sized for the tensegrity moves Carlos taught us.  I posted a video about this, with a title something like, \"What's this nonsense about scooping colors...\"\n\nCarlos certainly emphasized the idea that there are colors created by energy, floating around you at the periphery of your luminous shell.  And that they're just about the right size for applying to your body.\n\nBut now I have vague colors everywhere.  And often only anti-colors. Those are lines of dark and light, void of any actual glow.  But you can still \"feel\" them as lines.\nI now get mostly those, or the patchy fog.  There aren\u2019t any holes large enough to even stand in, let alone a patch you can scoop.  \n\nIf I want something to smear on my body, I have to scratch a patch out of the fixed structure that\u2019s all around me.  It leaks through my fingers, and it\u2019s not as bright as picking up a discrete blob.\n\nWhen it\u2019s like purple fog, I can expect a dream to materialize in the middle of it.   \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking it was Cholita coming to visit, and I can certainly see her form in the dreams.  That's new.\n\nNot to mention, when she shows up does seem to correspond to when she's asleep.   Cholita has RLS from her schizophrenia, so she's likely to be up at any time in the night building her little kingdom in the garage and garden.\n\nWhen she doesn't show up in dreaming, it's nice to hear a crashing sound from the parking lot at 2AM, where Cholita has decided to throw something away. It's usually another possession of mine that doesn't please her.\n\nShe stacks them by the block wall, and I haul them away the next morning.  That is, unless she's worried I'll see what she tossed out, and get angry.\n\nIn that case she forbids me to look at the stuff, until the garbage truck takes it way through the normal process.\n\nA few days ago, she tossed out many pounds of explosive chemicals. \n\nIf I hadn't looked we'd have ended up in Guantanamo for sure.  You have to dispose of those without putting garbage workers in danger of being blown sky high, and in 2019 it's hard to explain chemicals you could easily buy pre 9/11.\n\nYet when I hear her still awake and working in the middle of the night I'm happy, despite the potential horrors of what she's thrown away.\n\nWhen I hear her, I know why she hasn't shown up in dreaming.  She was awake.\n\nCall me old fashioned, but I'd rather run into someone's dreaming double when they're asleep. It's too hard to figure out what's going on, when they're awake.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s not always Cholita that shows up. It\u2019s mostly just random dreams, seemingly plucked out of the ether.  \n\nIn a few of them I just find someone I never met, like an overweight elderly man sleeping on his side in bed.  He materializes in my room just in time for me to see that he's fussing around and ready to turn over, to sleep on his other side.\n\nI'll watch the random people to see if there's anything to learn, get bored, and the scene changes.  \n\nThe changes are not dissimilar to someone swiping an image on a cell phone, to get to the next image.\n\nI seem to be picking up on the latent *intent* of sleeping people. \n\nFor me, a new dream simply \u201cblows in\u201d.  It's like finding my bed randomly dropped in a forest, by a lake, in a park, or wherever the dream was taking place.\n\nLast night a forest materialized around my room.  I couldn\u2019t detect where the bedroom walls were located. The forest seemed to stretch on normally.\n\nA sharply dressed woman with a big floppy hat was adjusting her tight fitting long dress, standing about 15 feet from me.  I was sitting up on my bed.\n\nShe didn't notice me. \n\nHer dress had fancy decorations on the edges, but was otherwise snug to her thin form. \n\nShe looked like she was just fidgeting, but on closer look it was obvious she was adjusting her clothes, because she was there to meet someone.  \n\nShe just didn\u2019t want it to be obvious.\n\nI watched her animate perfectly smoothly, like a movie.  And for a very long time, in terms of floating random dream images. She was there for a full 2 minutes, completely stable.\n\nInorganics have never done that for me, unless I was in a dream.\n\nWhen I\u2019m awake with eyes open in the darkness, even the full sized Fairy manifestation is only a series of still frames.  They only change when you notice them.\n\nThese dream animations are smooth. \n\nBecause of that, there\u2019s no doubt I have dreams in my room, while I\u2019m awake.  \n\nAnd maybe not my dreams.  I make it out to be a variation on the technique don Juan taught Carlos, for finding random people sleeping at night, in order to *see* them.\n\nBut the closest thing to this that I\u2019ve encountered, are people who write to me for advice, and it turns out that when they finally get around to looking at colors in the darkness, they find complex dreaming scenes instead.\n\nI always find that perplexing, because I can't give them advice on it.  \n\nDespite not understanding how to use it,  I would say that\u2019s one way things can go, if you use darkness for gazing.  \n\nSome of you might skip directly to full time waking dreams.\n\nRemember, Josefina went an entirely different direction from even these choices, by swishing out of her poncho and zipping into the patch of color.  \n\nDid she disappear completely into a dream?  It doesn't say.  But it didn't seem to bother Zuleica.\n\nSo you could potentially see the orderly blobs of color as I do.  Maybe that's the \"bored fuck\" view point.  \n\nOrderly.\n\nOr you could find yourself buried in chaotic dreaming scenes, with no idea what you should do about it.  \n\nIt's not like you're standing there sober, wondering what fun you can have with random dreaming  scenes.\n\nThat's easy to figure out!\n\nWhat happens here is, the dreaming chaos gives you a fuzzy head, and you can't think clearly.\n\nIn my case, I was surrounded by wonderfully delightful animating dreams, filling my room.\n\nAnd yet, the feeling in my head was, I'm failing!   My silence isn't good enough anymore!\n\nIt's all Cholita's fault!!!\n\nSo the dream chaos seems to come with some mental confusion. I'd speculate, you're being pulled on the edge of dreaming, where rationality begins to fail.  That produces a sense of frustration.\n\nThe stable blobs of color are more satisfying because you can interact with them, which increases the speed at which your assemblage point drifts.  \n\nIf you can manage a nice discrete inorganic being, like a floating head you can scoop, you\u2019re even better off.\n\nIt\u2019s hypnotic!  So you just keep watching the second attention, even forgetting that\u2019s why you're there. \n\nInstead, you\u2019re simply watching your little friend make faces for you.\n\nThat\u2019ll get you to heightened awareness quickly!  It's even faster than just scooping colors and applying them to your body.\n\nBut being buried in random unrecognizable dreams, as I am now, that\u2019s kind of messy.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure how someone would use that. Or for what.\n\nA good piece of advice for people who\u2019s experiences are chaotic like this is that perhaps you skipped a step. Maybe instead of being inept, you're talented.\n\nI know it\u2019s not satisfying, and you may feel like it\u2019s not working.\n\nBut if you see ANYTHING coming from the second attention, even if it\u2019s not all that satisfying, you can\u2019t go wrong just watching it in silence.\n\nIf you\u2019d like it to become more orderly, don\u2019t forget to use Zuleica\u2019s harp playing movement for as long as you can without becoming too bored.  That often helps trigger things for me.  Someone posting here mentioned it seemed to trigger colors for him also.\n\nThat technique is also partly what adds order to the dreaming chaos; building the frame of the second attention's energy body.\n\nEdited: eight times", "edited": 1572205734.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f5gryxp", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, often.

It happens something like once per several years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But lately it&amp;#39;s every night, that I get visitors from private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s Cholita.  She\u2019s scrambled me energetically.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main symptom is that my gazing at colors in darkness isn\u2019t tidy anymore.  Before I could just wait and a patch or two would float along.  They were around 6 inches to 2 feet in diameter, and distinct from the darkness.  Some had sharp edges, from which Carlos taught us to spin off text so we could \u201cread off the wall\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I could scoop the patches, because they were just about the right size to gather with the hand.  Most were perfectly sized for the tensegrity moves Carlos taught us.  I posted a video about this, with a title something like, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s this nonsense about scooping colors...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos certainly emphasized the idea that there are colors created by energy, floating around you at the periphery of your luminous shell.  And that they&amp;#39;re just about the right size for applying to your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now I have vague colors everywhere.  And often only anti-colors. Those are lines of dark and light, void of any actual glow.  But you can still &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; them as lines.\nI now get mostly those, or the patchy fog.  There aren\u2019t any holes large enough to even stand in, let alone a patch you can scoop.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I want something to smear on my body, I have to scratch a patch out of the fixed structure that\u2019s all around me.  It leaks through my fingers, and it\u2019s not as bright as picking up a discrete blob.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it\u2019s like purple fog, I can expect a dream to materialize in the middle of it.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been thinking it was Cholita coming to visit, and I can certainly see her form in the dreams.  That&amp;#39;s new.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, when she shows up does seem to correspond to when she&amp;#39;s asleep.   Cholita has RLS from her schizophrenia, so she&amp;#39;s likely to be up at any time in the night building her little kingdom in the garage and garden.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she doesn&amp;#39;t show up in dreaming, it&amp;#39;s nice to hear a crashing sound from the parking lot at 2AM, where Cholita has decided to throw something away. It&amp;#39;s usually another possession of mine that doesn&amp;#39;t please her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stacks them by the block wall, and I haul them away the next morning.  That is, unless she&amp;#39;s worried I&amp;#39;ll see what she tossed out, and get angry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that case she forbids me to look at the stuff, until the garbage truck takes it way through the normal process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, she tossed out many pounds of explosive chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I hadn&amp;#39;t looked we&amp;#39;d have ended up in Guantanamo for sure.  You have to dispose of those without putting garbage workers in danger of being blown sky high, and in 2019 it&amp;#39;s hard to explain chemicals you could easily buy pre 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet when I hear her still awake and working in the middle of the night I&amp;#39;m happy, despite the potential horrors of what she&amp;#39;s thrown away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I hear her, I know why she hasn&amp;#39;t shown up in dreaming.  She was awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Call me old fashioned, but I&amp;#39;d rather run into someone&amp;#39;s dreaming double when they&amp;#39;re asleep. It&amp;#39;s too hard to figure out what&amp;#39;s going on, when they&amp;#39;re awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it\u2019s not always Cholita that shows up. It\u2019s mostly just random dreams, seemingly plucked out of the ether.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a few of them I just find someone I never met, like an overweight elderly man sleeping on his side in bed.  He materializes in my room just in time for me to see that he&amp;#39;s fussing around and ready to turn over, to sleep on his other side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll watch the random people to see if there&amp;#39;s anything to learn, get bored, and the scene changes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The changes are not dissimilar to someone swiping an image on a cell phone, to get to the next image.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I seem to be picking up on the latent &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of sleeping people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me, a new dream simply \u201cblows in\u201d.  It&amp;#39;s like finding my bed randomly dropped in a forest, by a lake, in a park, or wherever the dream was taking place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night a forest materialized around my room.  I couldn\u2019t detect where the bedroom walls were located. The forest seemed to stretch on normally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sharply dressed woman with a big floppy hat was adjusting her tight fitting long dress, standing about 15 feet from me.  I was sitting up on my bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t notice me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her dress had fancy decorations on the edges, but was otherwise snug to her thin form. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked like she was just fidgeting, but on closer look it was obvious she was adjusting her clothes, because she was there to meet someone.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She just didn\u2019t want it to be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched her animate perfectly smoothly, like a movie.  And for a very long time, in terms of floating random dream images. She was there for a full 2 minutes, completely stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inorganics have never done that for me, unless I was in a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I\u2019m awake with eyes open in the darkness, even the full sized Fairy manifestation is only a series of still frames.  They only change when you notice them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These dream animations are smooth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of that, there\u2019s no doubt I have dreams in my room, while I\u2019m awake.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And maybe not my dreams.  I make it out to be a variation on the technique don Juan taught Carlos, for finding random people sleeping at night, in order to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the closest thing to this that I\u2019ve encountered, are people who write to me for advice, and it turns out that when they finally get around to looking at colors in the darkness, they find complex dreaming scenes instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always find that perplexing, because I can&amp;#39;t give them advice on it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite not understanding how to use it,  I would say that\u2019s one way things can go, if you use darkness for gazing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of you might skip directly to full time waking dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, Josefina went an entirely different direction from even these choices, by swishing out of her poncho and zipping into the patch of color.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did she disappear completely into a dream?  It doesn&amp;#39;t say.  But it didn&amp;#39;t seem to bother Zuleica.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you could potentially see the orderly blobs of color as I do.  Maybe that&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;bored fuck&amp;quot; view point.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Orderly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you could find yourself buried in chaotic dreaming scenes, with no idea what you should do about it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like you&amp;#39;re standing there sober, wondering what fun you can have with random dreaming  scenes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s easy to figure out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happens here is, the dreaming chaos gives you a fuzzy head, and you can&amp;#39;t think clearly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case, I was surrounded by wonderfully delightful animating dreams, filling my room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, the feeling in my head was, I&amp;#39;m failing!   My silence isn&amp;#39;t good enough anymore!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all Cholita&amp;#39;s fault!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the dream chaos seems to come with some mental confusion. I&amp;#39;d speculate, you&amp;#39;re being pulled on the edge of dreaming, where rationality begins to fail.  That produces a sense of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stable blobs of color are more satisfying because you can interact with them, which increases the speed at which your assemblage point drifts.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can manage a nice discrete inorganic being, like a floating head you can scoop, you\u2019re even better off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s hypnotic!  So you just keep watching the second attention, even forgetting that\u2019s why you&amp;#39;re there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, you\u2019re simply watching your little friend make faces for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019ll get you to heightened awareness quickly!  It&amp;#39;s even faster than just scooping colors and applying them to your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But being buried in random unrecognizable dreams, as I am now, that\u2019s kind of messy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not sure how someone would use that. Or for what.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good piece of advice for people who\u2019s experiences are chaotic like this is that perhaps you skipped a step. Maybe instead of being inept, you&amp;#39;re talented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it\u2019s not satisfying, and you may feel like it\u2019s not working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you see ANYTHING coming from the second attention, even if it\u2019s not all that satisfying, you can\u2019t go wrong just watching it in silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019d like it to become more orderly, don\u2019t forget to use Zuleica\u2019s harp playing movement for as long as you can without becoming too bored.  That often helps trigger things for me.  Someone posting here mentioned it seemed to trigger colors for him also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That technique is also partly what adds order to the dreaming chaos; building the frame of the second attention&amp;#39;s energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: eight times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/d60wnz/another_one/f5gryxp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1572196519.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_d60wnz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f5brxir", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1572125106.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_f5avd3k", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;We especially need to learn what can move between worlds. \n\nMaybe it has to be conscious, as in that giant legless bird-like creature, to crossover from alternate realities and stay for awhile (or longer than a while).

Actually I didn&amp;#39;t really fall into sleep, which is unconsciousness in most people. Instead I went right back to the dream. it was a different dream however but my ability to go right back into it was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m finding new ways to get silent and trying to get silent in my everyday activities just by as you say &amp;quot;forcing silence&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Truthfully if we all faced it, our internal dialogue is an Indulgence, something we&amp;#39;ve grown accustomed to indulging in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And lately I can feel how bad it is for me. Yes I could get wrapped up in politics and crazy people but that would drive me insane. It&amp;#39;s actually easier for me just to get silent around people and around their craziness not indulge in my thoughts. It&amp;#39;s kind of like getting off heroin. I would equate getting off the internal dialogue is very similar. Although I&amp;#39;ve never done heroin they say it&amp;#39;s a really hard drug to get off of. I see the internal dialogue beats that by about a million.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/d60wnz/another_one/f7zk42o/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1574111879.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_d60wnz", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f1aef9l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "CruCial_Js", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1569291810.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_d60wnz", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_12zwct", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Hahaha, good times, good times.

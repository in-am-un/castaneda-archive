Crickets. Why is that? Well for one, darkroom is *especially* hard for men. Most men are so far gone into the world of excessive rationality and scientific materialism that their perception is rigidly stuck on the blue line with no hope of escape.

We'll always get bad player guys, increasingly more so as the sub grows. Why anybody would want to exaggerate or straight up lie about their darkroom happenings is beyond me. Pretenders are basically signaling to intent that what they want is more pretend results! Anybody who wants progress would be deathly afraid of that, perhaps even the folks who maybe want a little magic mixed in with some attention seeking or profit-seeking motivations!\n\nAnyway, when I look back at my own experience in the darkroom, it took over 4 months of slaving away just to get to the same level some of our new witches find themselves at within a single day or a few short weeks of practice at most. So I suspect we just need more audiovisual material to help the men out (well, and also help women aswell). Here is a clip I made to demonstrate what one might see in the darkroom, complete with audio too! Youtube back-up link:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3K7iZlk3V8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3K7iZlk3V8) \n\n[Had to make due with a ghetto webcam mic so apologies in advance for the shit audio\ud83d\ude06 ](https://reddit.com/link/11x2mm6/video/zu4djbhcg0pa1/player)\n\nHere's how to interpret this video: This is basically a highlights clip combining notable experiences from ***many*** of my own darkroom sessions. For new people, it's extremely common to only get 1 or maybe 2 distinct darkroom perceptions (eg: sights, sounds, feelings, etc.) in a single darkroom session in the beginning. YMMV though. You might get significantly different perceptions as your assemblage point shifts; all the reason to get in the darkroom and see for yourself!\n\nOh and another note, the audio helps add emphasis to my actions in the darkroom. You can see at one point, my internal dialogue kicks into overdrive when I start pondering whether the \ud83d\ude10 face is a real IOB manifestation, which causes the perception to fade away quickly . When I shout \"SILENCE!\", I'm vocalizing my intent for silence and also forcing silence internally at the same time. When Fairy shows up, I'm happy to see her and she responds in kind!\n\nEdit: The video presents in a first person view so the stuff on the edges is basically periphery vision. The yellow mass on the bottom edge of the video depicts what can become visible in the periphery while performing the \"Mashing energy\" tensegrity movement. The stuff on the edges will shift out of the way quickly when you turn to look at it in the beginning.\n\nI'd say that this video is an o.k. representation of what you will witness in the darkroom; it's more accurate in the beginning but greatly fails to capture the weird stuff as the assemblage point moves down to the mid-point of the green zone. My animation skills are limited so you won't see any of the shimmering, twinkling and dare I say, 'mildly psychedelic' effects as the AP shifts. The puffs move! They'll be nondirectional at first, following the motion of your head but the stuff on the sides zip around constantly! Stuff that's missing: \"Flailing translucent smooth tubular tentacle arms things,\" that are \"shimmering, undulating and modulating in brightness/opacity all over my field of view\". How the hell would one animate that?! Also, towards the end, you see a dream bubble forming. Yes, it does get that clear and with color! Dream bubbles are different from remote viewing scenes (not depicted in this video) that may start showing up. In my experience, it's much easier to hold the perception of the \"black/purple\" scale remote viewing scenes than it is to hold attention on dream bubbles.\n\nAnother note: \"30 min to 1 hour later\" = an indeterminate amount of time before stuff starts showing up. I went weeks before I even saw a single dot off to the side but that's because I didn't follow directions and because I'm lazy! Don't worry if you're not seeing stuff yet, it's right around the corner if you work hard and follow the techniques here! Also, you'll be able to skip over the boring beginning stuff quickly as you accumulate time in the darkroom. But that doesn't mean you can take it easy!

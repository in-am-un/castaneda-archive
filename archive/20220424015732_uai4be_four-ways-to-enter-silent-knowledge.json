I heard that from Silent Knowledge.  It came with an explanation.

Not once you move into that purple.  I suspect it's a crossroad.\n\nIf you want a \"take away\" look in the upper right of the picture, at what Silent Knowledge is in terms of the assemblage point.  \n\nThe yellow one is your Tonal Body assemblage point.

They aren't bizarre, but weird is certainly what happens, anytime you engage the energy body in such a manner that it starts to form the double.\n\nKeep in mind, the double is aware even in pieces. As puffs.\n\nMiles has a lovely description of Carlos \"talking to his liver\", to thank it for digesting so well.\n\nhttps://energylifesciences.com/organs-have-their-own-consciousness/ - from Miles Reid\r  \n\r  \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20191112102603/https://energylifesciences.com/organs-have-their-own-consciousness/ - backup\n\nAnd Carlos gave a person in private classes trouble over their dreams.  He allowed people to ask questions or comment, and this person described a very long dream that seemed pretty much ordinary.  It just went on and on and was very vivid for the person.\n\nCarlos stopped them mid story and said, \"that's just your liver\".It's kind of insulting to a beginner, but he literally mean what he said!  The dream was from this person's liver!  No insult meant.\n\nSo the awareness that decided to take a birth here settled into those energy \"pouches\", and each pouch (3 proper, plus V spot) is actually larger organs in the body, which contain the awareness.\n\nTogether they form \"us\", but each \"planet\" (pouch) is it's only sentient being.The same is true of the double.\n\nWhen we \"stuff the puffs into a pouch\", we're  using the fact that awareness in our egg is attracted to other awareness.\n\nIt likes to \"cluster\".\n\nSo when you are doing tensegrity in darkness, you begin to lure the purple puffs towards the middle. They're pressed against the outside.  From our point of view in the middle.But the outside  they've been pushed to by worry and grief, is the inside of the larger luminous egg.\n\nI believe the tensegrity \"interests\" that energy, and it's certainly a reduction in grief and worry.  While you're doing it, you feel a little optimistic something good will happen.\n\nAnd so the puffs become visible.  It's possible they were mostly not there at all, and were more like purple jelly smeared on the inside of our egg.  Us doing an activity which engages our attention in activity, makes them pull away from the egg wall, and  they \"cluster\" into the puffs.\n\nSo here's the key to using the energy body to reach SK (silent knowledge).I shouldn't say \"key\" because someone else will discover and even better way.  Surely one of the long forms will get you directly there, we just don't know which yet.But my method using the energy body, is simply to get it interested.\n\nYou do normal darkroom to \"redeploy\" the energy from the sides to the middle.Stuff puffs in other words.\n\nWhen you can see the energy body visible as puffs still lingering where you stuffed them (shape and color change is expected), you continue searching the room for signs of coolness.\n\nWhitish light, the inside of an IOB cave, translocations, IOB faces.The normal sights.But you need to have only one goal in mind:  Move the assemblage point all the way to SK.Just don't \"fret\" over it.  You're \"waiting for a helping hand\".\n\nAt some point the puffs will offer themselves.  They'll float in front of the eyes, and the room will be filled with swirling purple light.We've all seen the puffs return to being brilliant, after we thought we had moved out of the red zone, and were in the orange.\n\nPeople look down, see intense purple puffs, and jet blackness mixed in there.\n\nA common sight.But what we didn't realize is, that's a \"puff power offer\".You're energy body is those puffs.  And they want to play!the most common \"play\" is to form them into a power object, just by gathering either the purple, or the blackness, into your hand, and then \"swirling\" the other around it.\n\nScoop up black and then swirl purple on the edges.\n\nOr scoop up the purple, and swirl the black on it.If you see some yellow, you can use that too.\n\nThe act of treating it as if it were real will cause your assemblage point to shift far sideways, and you'll form a power object.\n\nLike my little giant jawbreaker sized marble.  I would use it to illuminate remote viewing on my bedspread. There's a pic in here somewhere.\n\nJuann made a magic wand, and other items.Keep in mind, this is waking dreaming proper, due to the big horizontal shift.\n\nTechnically speaking, your tonal has given up most of the control and your dreaming double is the one interacting with the power object.  BUT, the power objects is also a piece of the double.\n\nSince you're deep into an actual dream (due to horizontal shift),  just about anything can happen!  Super cool magic is almost guaranteed.\n\nBut don't do that...If you want to reach SK mode.\n\nA horizontal shift like that is not conducive to moving the assemblage point the rest of the way on the  J curve.\n\nSo how to get the \"puff body\" to \"make you an offer you can't refuse\", by swarming all around in front of  you.  Especially in front of the eyes.\n\nJust remember that the next time you see purple but it's not puffs.  Check for a \"puff swarm\".  An offer you should not refuse.\n\nI've still got a cold, so I did the minimum Tensegrity to reach the orange zone.And then, since I wanted to \"engage\" the double, meaning I wanted him interested in the activity in the room, I just did a chore.\n\nI'd done my laundry earlier but had not hung up the shirts.In absolute darkness, I hung up around 12 shirts, one at a time.\n\nThe double became very interested.It's the technique Taisha taught us, in her latest book!\n\nWhat a GEM that book is.  It's always the women who bring new power.

And if you master this you can wear it as 'the coat of the double'.\"\n\nI had to question her.  \"You mean, by saying I can wear it, that I could go to work wearing the double as a coat???\"\n\nShe replied, \"Part of him at least\".\n\nI wanted to know if others could see it, and she commented that was always the issue, but Elias had a whole curandero business going on in the north, in his double.\n\nSo yes, people can see it, under the right circumstances.\n\nShe explained, the double got interested, I was hanging up coats, so he gave me another to hang up, when I ran out.\n\nI had the strangest idea.

They aren&amp;#39;t bizarre, but weird is certainly what happens, anytime you engage the energy body in such a manner that it starts to form the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, the double is aware even in pieces. As puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miles has a lovely description of Carlos &amp;quot;talking to his liver&amp;quot;, to thank it for digesting so well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://energylifesciences.com/organs-have-their-own-consciousness/\"&gt;https://energylifesciences.com/organs-have-their-own-consciousness/&lt;/a&gt; - from Miles Reid&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20191112102603/https://energylifesciences.com/organs-have-their-own-consciousness/\"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20191112102603/https://energylifesciences.com/organs-have-their-own-consciousness/&lt;/a&gt; - backup&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Carlos gave a person in private classes trouble over their dreams.  He allowed people to ask questions or comment, and this person described a very long dream that seemed pretty much ordinary.  It just went on and on and was very vivid for the person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos stopped them mid story and said, &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s just your liver&amp;quot;.It&amp;#39;s kind of insulting to a beginner, but he literally mean what he said!  The dream was from this person&amp;#39;s liver!  No insult meant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the awareness that decided to take a birth here settled into those energy &amp;quot;pouches&amp;quot;, and each pouch (3 proper, plus V spot) is actually larger organs in the body, which contain the awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Together they form &amp;quot;us&amp;quot;, but each &amp;quot;planet&amp;quot; (pouch) is it&amp;#39;s only sentient being.The same is true of the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we &amp;quot;stuff the puffs into a pouch&amp;quot;, we&amp;#39;re  using the fact that awareness in our egg is attracted to other awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It likes to &amp;quot;cluster&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when you are doing tensegrity in darkness, you begin to lure the purple puffs towards the middle. They&amp;#39;re pressed against the outside.  From our point of view in the middle.But the outside  they&amp;#39;ve been pushed to by worry and grief, is the inside of the larger luminous egg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe the tensegrity &amp;quot;interests&amp;quot; that energy, and it&amp;#39;s certainly a reduction in grief and worry.  While you&amp;#39;re doing it, you feel a little optimistic something good will happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so the puffs become visible.  It&amp;#39;s possible they were mostly not there at all, and were more like purple jelly smeared on the inside of our egg.  Us doing an activity which engages our attention in activity, makes them pull away from the egg wall, and  they &amp;quot;cluster&amp;quot; into the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the key to using the energy body to reach SK (silent knowledge).I shouldn&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;key&amp;quot; because someone else will discover and even better way.  Surely one of the long forms will get you directly there, we just don&amp;#39;t know which yet.But my method using the energy body, is simply to get it interested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You do normal darkroom to &amp;quot;redeploy&amp;quot; the energy from the sides to the middle.Stuff puffs in other words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you can see the energy body visible as puffs still lingering where you stuffed them (shape and color change is expected), you continue searching the room for signs of coolness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whitish light, the inside of an IOB cave, translocations, IOB faces.The normal sights.But you need to have only one goal in mind:  Move the assemblage point all the way to SK.Just don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;fret&amp;quot; over it.  You&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;waiting for a helping hand&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point the puffs will offer themselves.  They&amp;#39;ll float in front of the eyes, and the room will be filled with swirling purple light.We&amp;#39;ve all seen the puffs return to being brilliant, after we thought we had moved out of the red zone, and were in the orange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People look down, see intense purple puffs, and jet blackness mixed in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A common sight.But what we didn&amp;#39;t realize is, that&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;puff power offer&amp;quot;.You&amp;#39;re energy body is those puffs.  And they want to play!the most common &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; is to form them into a power object, just by gathering either the purple, or the blackness, into your hand, and then &amp;quot;swirling&amp;quot; the other around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scoop up black and then swirl purple on the edges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or scoop up the purple, and swirl the black on it.If you see some yellow, you can use that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The act of treating it as if it were real will cause your assemblage point to shift far sideways, and you&amp;#39;ll form a power object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like my little giant jawbreaker sized marble.  I would use it to illuminate remote viewing on my bedspread. There&amp;#39;s a pic in here somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juann made a magic wand, and other items.Keep in mind, this is waking dreaming proper, due to the big horizontal shift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, your tonal has given up most of the control and your dreaming double is the one interacting with the power object.  BUT, the power objects is also a piece of the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since you&amp;#39;re deep into an actual dream (due to horizontal shift),  just about anything can happen!  Super cool magic is almost guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t do that...If you want to reach SK mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A horizontal shift like that is not conducive to moving the assemblage point the rest of the way on the  J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how to get the &amp;quot;puff body&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;make you an offer you can&amp;#39;t refuse&amp;quot;, by swarming all around in front of  you.  Especially in front of the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember that the next time you see purple but it&amp;#39;s not puffs.  Check for a &amp;quot;puff swarm&amp;quot;.  An offer you should not refuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve still got a cold, so I did the minimum Tensegrity to reach the orange zone.And then, since I wanted to &amp;quot;engage&amp;quot; the double, meaning I wanted him interested in the activity in the room, I just did a chore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d done my laundry earlier but had not hung up the shirts.In absolute darkness, I hung up around 12 shirts, one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double became very interested.It&amp;#39;s the technique Taisha taught us, in her latest book!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What a GEM that book is.  It&amp;#39;s always the women who bring new power.  That&amp;#39;s why Carlos used women to introduce new topics with a high magical content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lidotska got this place going, according to how Juann remembers the sequence of events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was simply &amp;quot;too far out there&amp;quot; to believe for real, but when Lidotska verified it, that changed the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Taisha has done the same with her book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did whatever she did to move her assemblage point with Zuleica around, then went into the tree house where the Shadow beings lived (tree spirits), and used them to hold her attention at the new assemblage point position.

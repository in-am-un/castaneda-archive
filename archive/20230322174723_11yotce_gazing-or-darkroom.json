They saw how many years Carlos and the apprentices put into it.\n\nBut they've been brainwashed by \"pay for fake\" magical systems.\n\nWho flatter the hell out of people, and imply magic is just around the corner.\n\nThey claim you'll see magic sooner than anywhere else, in the fake systems.\n\nExcept, the opposite is true.\n\nThey NEVER see magic.\n\nBeyond what a woman can do 10 times more, in a nice bath surrounded by flowers or candles.\n\nOr beyond what a man can experience with shamanic drumming.\n\nPeople confuse the delusions they're given by a \"system\", with the odd sensations, minor visions, and bliss that come from any method which interrupts the obsessive internal dialogue.\n\nSo when you try to point out they never, nor does anyone in their system ever actually see magic, they freak out.\n\nAnd gloss away any ability you might have to talk some sense into them.\n\nI spend HOURS a night traveling between realities, playing with amazing spirits who are my friends, and visiting with witches in shared dreaming.\n\nHours.\n\nNot one weird thing happened 6 months ago, and I'm going to pretend I \"mastered that\".\n\nReal magic is daily. Not a rare event you use to get your own little throne.\n\nSo gazing is the fastest path, but it's very unlikely you'll keep it up.\n\nBecause you'll be alone on that path.\n\nNo one else in here is using it right now.\n\nI'd avoid the candles.

Fully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just read this subreddit, post after post with all comments, until you &amp;quot;get the idea&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only 1 in 100 gets serious enough to produce any results. And that&amp;#39;s on a path where dozens of others are traveling, and they can read about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a solo path?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 in 300 perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the 299 always think, &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re the ONE.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too much Matrix movie I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;#39;t know that back then. I thought  you could pep talk anyone into going very far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Truth was, all they wanted was attention, to chat, to posture, or whatever it is that makes Castaneda fans such annoying frauds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I did have spectacular results teaching around 3 to gaze. One man, and two women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At ferns, shadows, and even the heater grill in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Your butt will fall asleep sitting on the toilet like that, so I don&amp;#39;t recommend it.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They weren&amp;#39;t faking it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could tell from what they reported.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe one day, one of the women will make a gazing picture for me, showing what to look for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or I&amp;#39;ll animate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; that can&amp;#39;t possibly be there is what you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You gaze, FORCING SILENCE, until you see something impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or doze off, snap out of it, and remember a vague tiny dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It means you moved your assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, women don&amp;#39;t really have to FORCE silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beats me what they do instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as long as you see &amp;quot;sparkles&amp;quot;, hallucinations, purple stuff, it&amp;#39;s what you need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;tool&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, make more of it!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, everyone gets bored and stops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have a 15 year old in here who on hearing it might takes years to reach silent knowledge, once you can find a puff, said, &amp;quot;YEARS??!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People read the books. They saw how many years Carlos and the apprentices put into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed by &amp;quot;pay for fake&amp;quot; magical systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who flatter the hell out of people, and imply magic is just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They claim you&amp;#39;ll see magic sooner than anywhere else, in the fake systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, the opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They NEVER see magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond what a woman can do 10 times more, in a nice bath surrounded by flowers or candles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or beyond what a man can experience with shamanic drumming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People confuse the delusions they&amp;#39;re given by a &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;, with the odd sensations, minor visions, and bliss that come from any method which interrupts the obsessive internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when you try to point out they never, nor does anyone in their system ever actually see magic, they freak out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And gloss away any ability you might have to talk some sense into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spend HOURS a night traveling between realities, playing with amazing spirits who are my friends, and visiting with witches in shared dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not one weird thing happened 6 months ago, and I&amp;#39;m going to pretend I &amp;quot;mastered that&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real magic is daily. Not a rare event you use to get your own little throne.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So gazing is the fastest path, but it&amp;#39;s very unlikely you&amp;#39;ll keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you&amp;#39;ll be alone on that path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one else in here is using it right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d avoid the candles.

He said that once inner silence is\r\nattained, the bonds that tie the assemblage point to the particular spot where it is placed begin to\r\nbreak and the assemblage point is free to move.\r\nHe said that the movement ordinarily is toward the left, that such a directional preference is a\r\nnatural reaction of most human beings, but that there are seers who can direct that movement to\r\npositions below the customary spot where the point is located.

To go below is counter to\r\nour interest, although the easiest thing to do.\"\r\nDon Juan also said that among the many errors of judgment the old seers had committed, one\r\nof the most grievous was moving their assemblage points to the immeasurable area below, which\r\nmade them experts at adopting animal forms. They chose different animals as their point of\r\nreference and called those animals their nagual. They believed that by moving their assemblage\r\npoints to specific spots they would acquire the characteristics of the animal of their choice, its\r\nstrength or wisdom or cunning or agility or ferocity.\"\n\n....\n\n\"\"There are other complete worlds that our assemblage points can assemble,\" he went on. \"The\r\nold seers counted seven such worlds, one for each band of awareness. I'll add that two of those worlds, besides the world of everyday life, are easy to assemble; the other five are something\r\nelse.\"\r\nWhen we again sat down to talk, don Juan immediately began to talk about my experience\r\nwith la Catalina. He said that a shift of the assemblage point to the area below its customary\r\nposition allows the seer a detailed and narrow view of the world we know. So detailed is that\r\nview that it seems to be an entirely different world. It is a mesmerizing view that has a\r\ntremendous appeal, especially for those seers who have an adventurous but somehow indolent\r\nand lazy spirit.\r\n\"The change of perspective is very pleasant,\" don Juan went on. \"Minimal effort is required,\r\nand the results are staggering. If a seer is driven by quick gain, there is no better maneuver than\r\nthe shift below. The only problem is that in those positions of the assemblage point, seers are\r\nplagued by death, which happens even more brutally and more quickly than in man's position.\r\n\"The nagual Julian thought it was a great place for cavorting, but that's all.\"\r\nHe said that a true change of worlds happens only when the assemblage point moves into\r\nman's band, deep enough to reach a crucial threshold, at which stage the assemblage point can use\r\nanother of the great bands.\r\n\"How does it use it?\" I asked.\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"It's a matter of energy,\" he said. \"The force of alignment hooks\r\nanother band, provided that the seer has enough energy. Our normal energy allows our\r\nassemblage points to use the force of alignment of one great band of emanations. And we\r\nperceive the world we know. But if we have a surplus of energy, we can use the force of\r\nalignment of other great bands, and consequently we perceive other worlds.\"\r\nDon Juan abruptly changed the subject and began to talk about plants.\r\n\"This may seem like an oddity to you,\" he said, \"but trees, for instance, are closer to man than\r\nants. I've told you that trees and man can develop a great relationship; that's so because they share\r\nemanations.\"\r\n\n\n&gt;Each time Cleargreen writes something , I read it looking for indications of advanced knowledge.\n\n&gt;I never find any.\n\nBecause they just teach passes + some extra \"stalking\" techniques...

They believed that by moving their assemblage\npoints to specific spots they would acquire the characteristics of the animal of their choice, its\nstrength or wisdom or cunning or agility or ferocity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;There are other complete worlds that our assemblage points can assemble,&amp;quot; he went on. &amp;quot;The\nold seers counted seven such worlds, one for each band of awareness. I&amp;#39;ll add that two of those worlds, besides the world of everyday life, are easy to assemble; the other five are something\nelse.&amp;quot;\nWhen we again sat down to talk, don Juan immediately began to talk about my experience\nwith la Catalina. He said that a shift of the assemblage point to the area below its customary\nposition allows the seer a detailed and narrow view of the world we know. So detailed is that\nview that it seems to be an entirely different world. It is a mesmerizing view that has a\ntremendous appeal, especially for those seers who have an adventurous but somehow indolent\nand lazy spirit.\n&amp;quot;The change of perspective is very pleasant,&amp;quot; don Juan went on. &amp;quot;Minimal effort is required,\nand the results are staggering. If a seer is driven by quick gain, there is no better maneuver than\nthe shift below. The only problem is that in those positions of the assemblage point, seers are\nplagued by death, which happens even more brutally and more quickly than in man&amp;#39;s position.\n&amp;quot;The nagual Julian thought it was a great place for cavorting, but that&amp;#39;s all.&amp;quot;\nHe said that a true change of worlds happens only when the assemblage point moves into\nman&amp;#39;s band, deep enough to reach a crucial threshold, at which stage the assemblage point can use\nanother of the great bands.\n&amp;quot;How does it use it?&amp;quot; I asked.\nHe shrugged his shoulders. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a matter of energy,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;The force of alignment hooks\nanother band, provided that the seer has enough energy. Our normal energy allows our\nassemblage points to use the force of alignment of one great band of emanations. And we\nperceive the world we know. But if we have a surplus of energy, we can use the force of\nalignment of other great bands, and consequently we perceive other worlds.&amp;quot;\nDon Juan abruptly changed the subject and began to talk about plants.\n&amp;quot;This may seem like an oddity to you,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;but trees, for instance, are closer to man than\nants. I&amp;#39;ve told you that trees and man can develop a great relationship; that&amp;#39;s so because they share\nemanations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each time Cleargreen writes something , I read it looking for indications of advanced knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never find any.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they just teach passes + some extra &amp;quot;stalking&amp;quot; techniques...

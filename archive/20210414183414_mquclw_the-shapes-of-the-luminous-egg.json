Does it hang outside? Or is it attached to the luminous ball?\"\n\n\"It pushes the contours of the energy shape out, without breaking its energy boundaries.\"\n\nDon Juan explained that the end result of a **movement** of the assemblage point is a total change in the energy shape of a human being. Instead of a ball or an egg, he becomes something resembling a smoking pipe. The tip of the stem is the assemblage point, and the bowl of the pipe is what remains of the luminous ball.\n\nIf the assemblage point keeps on moving, a moment comes when the luminous ball becomes a thin line of energy.  Don Juan went on to explain that the old sorcerers were the only ones who accomplished this feat of energy shape transformation.\n\nAnd I asked him whether in their new energetic shape those sorcerers were still men.  \"Of course they were still men,\" he said. \"But I think what you want to know is if they were still men of reason, trustworthy persons. Well, not quite.\"\n\n\"In what way were they different?\"\n\n\"In their concerns. Human endeavors and preoccupations had no meaning whatsoever to them. They also had a definite new appearance.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that they didn't look like men?\"\n\n\"It's very hard to tell what was what about those sorcerers. They certainly looked like men. What else would they look like? But they were not quite like what you or I would expect. Yet if you pressed me to tell in what way they were different, I would go in circles, like a dog chasing its tail.\"\n\n\"Have you ever met one of those men, don Juan?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have met one.\"\n\n\"What did he look like?\"\n\n\"As far as looks, he looked like a regular person. Now, it was his behavior that was unusual.\"\n\n\"In what way was it unusual?\"\n\n\"All I can tell you is that the behavior of the sorcerer I met is something that defies the imagination. But to make it a matter of merely behavior is misleading. It is really something you must see to appreciate.\"\n\n\"Were all those sorcerers like the one you met?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I don't know how the others were, except through sorcerers' stories handed  down from generation to generation. And those stories portray them as being quite bizarre.\"\n\n\"Do you mean monstrous?\"\n\n\"Not at all. They say that they were very likable but extremely scary. They were more like unknown creatures. What makes mankind homogeneous is the fact that we are all luminous balls. And those sorcerers were no longer balls of energy but lines of energy that were trying to bend themselves into circles, which they couldn't quite make.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFor new seer technique, look for \"fire from within\" in 'all in one'.\n\nI don't have the text of what the new seers did.  It's a different passage where don Juan explains that we only deviate from the old seers at the last minute, by stretching into an infinite line instead of the pipe shape.\n\nAnyone know where that text is?  I'll add it here.\n\nKeep in mind, that word, \"movement\", is different than shift.\n\nA movement is outside the normal limits of the shell.  I suppose, so far in the dark room we have never done that.  So far we only \"shift\" it.  And only down.\n\nI had no idea it could go up!  That blue line is useful for more than it seems!!\n\nCould be why Carlos didn't say much about it.  He started his finger, while teaching about the J curve, up there on the blue line.  He said that's where it normally is located, and then his finger wavered a tiny bit. I expected him to say more, but he seems to have thought twice, and moved on to what happens as it moves down.\n\nHe might have had the same problem I've been having lately.  I discover so many new things in the darkroom each night, but none of them would be helpful if described to beginners.  In fact, they'd create a useless obsession and keep some from beginning where they need to.\n\nIf Carlos had a single student back then who could make sense of it, he might have explained a lot more.  But he had none.\n\nI expect that the feeling of shifting the assemblage point, which many of us are learning,  ought to apply in reverse.  For shifting it up and back.\n\nSo I have no doubt someone will turn into a smoking pipe one of these days.\n\nWhile we're at it, anyone have the \"movement\" vs \"shift\" passages?\n\nThis is been a confusing topic for the last 40 years.  We could straighten that out in the minds of fans.\n\nBetter understandings of inventories are popular, and will be carried into the group discussion nether realms if we put it here.\n\nCholita's advice: Don't criticize bad players.  Make use of them.\n\nWait...

I posted it a couple of days ago.\n\nIt's not how I discovered it, but it's designed to teach you what you need to get to the \"zone\" for IOBs.\n\nNot on purpose. I think Carlos was just teaching us that your gaze can move the energy.\n\nHe probably didn't think we were going to obsess over dark room gazing, where that pass has different implications.\n\nGaze at the floor until you get a bright purple ball of light there.  Or rather, a circle.  Oddly, when you perceive them on the floor they are \"flatish\".  \n\nThen use your gaze to move it the way it does in that pass.\n\nWhen it follows your gaze correctly, start the pass over.\n\nLook to the ground, and hopefully no purple yet.\n\nBut the purple should literally swim in from around the room, as if obeying your gaze. Like tossing bread pieces into a pond where there are ducks, and they all head over at once.\n\nNow you can \"lure\" colors to where you want, using your gaze.\n\nThat pass is done standing, but move to the bed.\n\nSitting up on pillows, pretend you can't even move a muscle you're so tired (which might actually be true for some of you).\n\nUse only your gaze, looking around the room for colors to summon them closer to you.\n\nDon't turn the head, the way you do in recap. It can't be mechanical, or you'll start fantasizing.\n\nYou look around the room deliberately, not even turning the head if you can get away with it.  But if you can't find any, you can even turn the torso to look left or right.\n\nOr turn your neck too of course, but just don't fall into a mechanical scanning technique.\n\nIf you do turn way left or right, compare energy on the left side, to the right.  See if there's a \"sparkle\" difference.\n\nEventually you'll find a puff of color you can summon over by gazing into it.   You don't PULL on it with your gaze.\n\nThat's all wrong.\n\nIf you start doing that, you'll become a slave to the puffs.\n\nJust look at it without moving your faze away, as if you were interested in it.  It won't have any choice but to come nearer, if you don't interfere.\n\nSame happens in dreaming, if you've done 4 gates dreaming.  \n\nTry to manifest an object using the center of it.  Silence, plus seeing some sparkle or detail in it, should intend that to form into a real thing.\n\nYou want to slow that down to the point that you can catch the \"intent\" of the thing, materializing in your mind.\n\nThat could be as simple as, \"It looks like it's a...  No wait.  Not that.  NO.  Yes!  It's a house on a hill.\"\n\nThat moment is the intent of it.\n\nCould even be, \"It's a house on a hill, and Beatrice lives there alone, with 3 cats.\"\n\nThe intent of the thing can be as complex as an entire world.\n\nBut you just want to catch it coming in.  Doesn't matter what it is.\n\nThere's the sight of it.  That's easy to perceive.  But to catch the start of the \"understanding\" of what it is, requires steadyness.\n\nIn the process of trying to do that, the other colors in the room are pulled over.\n\nIt's the \"opposite of worry\".  \n\nGazing, in hope.\n\nThe colors dispersed on the periphery of your luminous shell, by all of your worrying, cut loose and drift over.\n\nThey settle on the shell of the energy body, which is smaller than the larger shell.\n\nIf they crowd in too close, you're out of luck for IOBs.\n\nIf they sit only on the surface of that energy body shell, forming a layer with \"thickness\", then IOBs like it inside the thickness zone.\n\nIf you are going from object to object with your gaze, hoping to separate the intent from the image on each object that can manifest something (has enough energy to be a body or place), and you pass into the middle of the thickness, you'll find your IOB in there, swimming around.\n\nFancy likes to spin, like she was swirling in the toilet, headed down.  Face up. It's sort of funny.\n\nI suppose (didn't think of it before), she was swirling in the assemblage point of the energy body.\n\nThe energy lured to cover the shell, was enough to make a \"body\" for her.\n\nOther IOBs show up along there.  They each have a different \"alien feeling\".\n\nI'm afraid to say, doing this may lead to losing the form of your IOBs.\n\nI like them to have an appearance.  Like a pretty Fairy.\n\nLa Gorda's near brag that she doesn't see that anymore, and they are just a \"pressure\", sounds horrible to me.\n\nShe likes that big eyeball, so there's no accounting for taste.\n\nI peg her as the kind who hangs fuzzy dice on her rear view mirror.  Then complains some women hang garter belts there.\n\nInside that band of energy, the \"pressure\" La Gorda spoke of sort of becomes visible.\n\nIt's not what you'd expect.\n\nAnd  I can certainly see how the ability to perceive that, would prevent them from forming a face or body.\n\nIt's a little like having a pesky neighborhood boy, who likes to sneak up on your and jump out.\n\nIf you learn to smell his brand of bubble gum as he hides behind something, he can't surprise you anymore.\n\nThe IOBs seem to notice, when you notice them before they have a visual appearance.", "edited": 1618431096.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_guixusm", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Opening a Window...&amp;quot; pass from the Maui series.

It won&amp;#39;t have any choice but to come nearer, if you don&amp;#39;t interfere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same happens in dreaming, if you&amp;#39;ve done 4 gates dreaming.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to manifest an object using the center of it.  Silence, plus seeing some sparkle or detail in it, should intend that to form into a real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want to slow that down to the point that you can catch the &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; of the thing, materializing in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That could be as simple as, &amp;quot;It looks like it&amp;#39;s a...  No wait.  Not that.  NO.  Yes!  It&amp;#39;s a house on a hill.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That moment is the intent of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could even be, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a house on a hill, and Beatrice lives there alone, with 3 cats.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The intent of the thing can be as complex as an entire world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you just want to catch it coming in.  Doesn&amp;#39;t matter what it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the sight of it.  That&amp;#39;s easy to perceive.  But to catch the start of the &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot; of what it is, requires steadyness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the process of trying to do that, the other colors in the room are pulled over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;opposite of worry&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gazing, in hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The colors dispersed on the periphery of your luminous shell, by all of your worrying, cut loose and drift over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They settle on the shell of the energy body, which is smaller than the larger shell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they crowd in too close, you&amp;#39;re out of luck for IOBs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they sit only on the surface of that energy body shell, forming a layer with &amp;quot;thickness&amp;quot;, then IOBs like it inside the thickness zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are going from object to object with your gaze, hoping to separate the intent from the image on each object that can manifest something (has enough energy to be a body or place), and you pass into the middle of the thickness, you&amp;#39;ll find your IOB in there, swimming around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy likes to spin, like she was swirling in the toilet, headed down.  Face up. It&amp;#39;s sort of funny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose (didn&amp;#39;t think of it before), she was swirling in the assemblage point of the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The energy lured to cover the shell, was enough to make a &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; for her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other IOBs show up along there.  They each have a different &amp;quot;alien feeling&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid to say, doing this may lead to losing the form of your IOBs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like them to have an appearance.  Like a pretty Fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;La Gorda&amp;#39;s near brag that she doesn&amp;#39;t see that anymore, and they are just a &amp;quot;pressure&amp;quot;, sounds horrible to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She likes that big eyeball, so there&amp;#39;s no accounting for taste.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I peg her as the kind who hangs fuzzy dice on her rear view mirror.  Then complains some women hang garter belts there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside that band of energy, the &amp;quot;pressure&amp;quot; La Gorda spoke of sort of becomes visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not what you&amp;#39;d expect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And  I can certainly see how the ability to perceive that, would prevent them from forming a face or body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a little like having a pesky neighborhood boy, who likes to sneak up on your and jump out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you learn to smell his brand of bubble gum as he hides behind something, he can&amp;#39;t surprise you anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The IOBs seem to notice, when you notice them before they have a visual appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_mquclw", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mquclw/the_shapes_of_the_luminous_egg/guixusm/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1618430338.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1618430338.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "guisc65", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_guidruf", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;I've discovered their \"comfort zone\", and can summon one after the other, some completely new to me.\n\nYou probably shouldn't lay out specifics, since after getting to heightened awareness it would likely become obvious to anyone, but a few clues to tip people in the right direction could be useful to aid in attracting new ones.\n\nAs important as that is (naturally) turning out to be.\n\n(you may have mentioned it before, but 3 times is the charm)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_guisc65", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve discovered their &amp;quot;comfort zone&amp;quot;, and can summon one after the other, some completely new to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You probably shouldn&amp;#39;t lay out specifics, since after getting to heightened awareness it would likely become obvious to anyone, but a few clues to tip people in the right direction could be useful to aid in attracting new ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As important as that is (naturally) turning out to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(you may have mentioned it before, but 3 times is the charm)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_mquclw", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mquclw/the_shapes_of_the_luminous_egg/guisc65/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1618427948.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1618427948.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "guidruf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1618421519.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gui9rzx", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I see inorganic beings all the time.

And in full awareness they fuse themselves to the emanations at large, and glide into eternity.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that the old seers, being the masters of awareness, applied their expertise to their own \nglows of awareness and made them expand to inconceivable limits. They actually aimed at \nlighting up all the emanations inside their cocoons, one band at a time. They succeeded, but oddly enough the accomplishment of lighting up one band at a time was instrumental in their becoming imprisoned in the quagmire of the second attention. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The new seers corrected that error,&amp;quot; he continued, &amp;quot;and let the mastery of awareness develop to its natural end, which is to extend the glow of awareness beyond the bounds of the luminous cocoon in one single stroke. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The third attention is attained when the glow of awareness turns into the fire from within: a \nglow that kindles not one band at a time but all the Eagle&amp;#39;s emanations inside man&amp;#39;s cocoon.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan expressed his awe for the new seers&amp;#39; deliberate effort to attain the third attention \nwhile they are alive and conscious of their individuality. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He did not consider it worthwhile to discuss the random cases of men and other sentient \nbeings who enter into the unknown and the unknowable without being aware of it; he referred to this as the Eagle&amp;#39;s gift. He asserted that for the new seers to enter into the third attention is also a gift, but has a different meaning, it is more like a reward for an attainment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He added that at the moment of dying all human beings enter into the unknowable and some \nof them do attain the third attention, but altogether too briefly and only to purify the food for the Eagle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The supreme accomplishment of human beings,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;is to attain that level of attention while retaining the life-force, without becoming a disembodied awareness moving like a flicker of light up to the Eagle&amp;#39;s beak to be devoured.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mquclw/the_shapes_of_the_luminous_egg/gujq5rl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1618443895.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_mquclw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gum4g11", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1618500467.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gujq6oo", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;\"Gazing in teams, the new seers were able to see the separation between the tumbling and the circular aspects,\" \n\nAnd:\n\n&gt;\"Are there different- size circles?\" I asked. \"Don't take me so literally,\" he protested. \"There are no circles to speak of, just a circular force that gives seers, who are dreaming it, \n\nSo this relates to something Fancy tried to explain to me.

It's lovely, in \nfact. The new seers recommend that we open ourselves to it. The old seers also opened \nthemselves to it, but for reasons and purposes guided mostly by self-importance and obsession. \n\n\"The new seers, on the other hand, make friends with it. They become familiar with that force \nby handling it without any self-importance. The result is staggering in its consequences.\"\n\nHe said that a shift of the assemblage point is all that is needed to open oneself to the rolling \nforce. He added that if the force is seen in a deliberate manner, there is minimal danger. A \nsituation that is extremely dangerous, however, is an involuntary shift of the assemblage point \nowing, perhaps, to physical fatigue, emotional exhaustion, disease, or simply a minor emotional \nor physical crisis, such as being frightened or being drunk. \n\n\"When the assemblage point shifts involuntarily, the rolling force cracks the cocoon,\" he went \non. \"I've talked many times about a gap that man has below his navel. It's not really below the \nnavel itself, but in the cocoon, at the height of the navel. The gap is more like a dent, a natural \nflaw in the otherwise smooth cocoon. It is there where the tumbler hits us ceaselessly and where \nthe cocoon cracks.\" \n\nHe went on to explain that if it is a minor shift of the assemblage point, the crack is very \nsmall, the cocoon quickly repairs itself, and people experience what everybody has at one time or another: blotches of color and contorted shapes, which remain even if the eyes are closed. \n\nIf the shift is considerable, the crack also is extensive and it takes time for the cocoon to repair itself, as in the case of warriors who purposely use power plants to elicit that shift or people who take drugs and unwittingly do the same. In these cases men feel numb and cold; they have difficulty talking or even thinking; it is as if they have been frozen from inside. \n\nDon Juan said that in cases in which the assemblage point shifts drastically because of the effects of trauma or of a mortal disease, the rolling force produces a crack the length of the \ncocoon; the cocoon collapses and curls in on itself, and the individual dies. \n\n\"Can a voluntary shift also produce a gap of that nature?\" I asked. \n\n\"Sometimes,\" he replied. \"We're really frail. As the tumbler hits us over and over, death comes \nto us through the gap. Death is the rolling force. When it finds weakness in the gap of a luminous \nbeing it automatically cracks it open and makes it collapse.\" \n\n\"Does every living being have a gap?\" I asked. \n\n\"Of course,\" he replied. \"If it didn't have one it wouldn't die. The gaps are different, however, \nin size and configuration. Man's gap is a bowl-like depression the size of a fist, a very frail \nvulnerable configuration. The gaps of other organic creatures are very much like man's; some are stronger than ours and others are weaker. But the gap of inorganic beings is really different. It's more like a long thread, a hair of luminosity; consequently, inorganic beings are infinitely more durable than we are. \n\n\"There is something hauntingly appealing about the long life of those creatures, and the old \nseers could not resist being carried away by that appeal.\" \n\nHe said that the same force can produce two effects that are diametrically opposed. The old \nseers were imprisoned by the rolling force, and the new seers are rewarded for their toils with the gift of freedom. By becoming familiar with the rolling force through the mastery of intent, the new seers, at a given moment, open their own cocoons and the force floods them rather than rolling them up like a curled-up sowbug. The final result is their total and instantaneous \ndisintegration. \n\nI asked him a lot of questions about the survival of awareness after the luminous being is \nconsumed by the fire from within. He did not answer. He simply chuckled, shrugged his \nshoulders, and went on to say that the old seers' obsession with the tumbler blinded them to the \nother side of that force. The new seers, with their usual thoroughness in refusing tradition, went to the other extreme. They were at first totally averse to focusing their seeing on the tumbler; they argued that they needed to understand the force of the emanations at large in its aspect of life-giver and enhancer of awareness. \n\n\"They realized that it is infinitely easier to destroy something,\" don Juan went on, \"than it is to build it and maintain it. To roll life away is nothing compared to giving it and nourishing it. Of course, the new seers were wrong on this count, but in due course they corrected their mistake.\" \n\n\"How were they wrong, don Juan?\" \n\n\"It's an error to isolate anything for seeing. At the beginning, the new seers did exactly the \nopposite from what their predecessors did. They focused with equal attention on the other side of \nthe tumbler. What happened to them was as terrible as, if not worse than, what happened to the old seers. They died stupid deaths, just as the average man does. They didn't have the mystery or the malignancy of the ancient seers, nor had they the quest for freedom of the seers of today. \n\n\"Those first new seers served everybody. Because they were focusing their seeing on the life-giving side of the emanations, they were filled with love and kindness. But that didn't keep them from being tumbled. They were vulnerable, just as were the old seers who were filled with morbidity.\" \n\nHe said that for the modern-day new seers, to be left stranded after a life of discipline and toil, \njust like men who have never had a purposeful moment in their lives, was intolerable. \n\nDon Juan said that these new seers realized, after they had readopted their tradition, that the \nold seers' knowledge of the rolling force had been complete; at one point the old seers had \nconcluded that there were, in effect, two different aspects of the same force. The tumbling aspect relates exclusively to destruction and death. The circular aspect, on the other hand, is what maintains life and awareness, fulfillment and purpose. They had chosen, however, to deal exclusively with the tumbling aspect. \n\n\"Gazing in teams, the new seers were able to see the separation between the tumbling and the circular aspects,\" he explained. \"They saw that both forces are fused, but are not the same. The circular force comes to us just before the tumbling force; they are so close to each other that they seem the same. \n\n\"The reason it's called the circular force is that it comes in rings, threadlike hoops of \niridescence - a very delicate affair indeed. And just like the tumbling force, it strikes all living \nbeings ceaselessly, but for a different puipose. It strikes them to give them strength, direction, \nawareness; to give them life. \n\n\"What the new seers discovered is that the balance of the two forces in every living being is a very delicate one,\" he continued, \"if at any given time an individual feels that the tumbling force strikes harder than the circular one, that means the balance is upset; the tumbling force strikes harder and harder from then on, until it cracks the living being's gap and makes it die.\" \n\nHe added that out of what I had called balls of fire comes an iridescent hoop exactly the size \nof living beings, whether men, trees, microbes, or allies. \n\n\"Are there different- size circles?\" I asked. \n\n\"Don't take me so literally,\" he protested. \"There are no circles to speak of, just a circular force \nthat gives seers, who are dreaming it, the feeling of rings. And there are no different sizes either. \nIt's one indivisible force that fits all living beings, organic and inorganic.\" \n\n\"Why did the old seers focus on the tumbling aspect?\" I asked. \n\n\"Because they believed that their lives depended on seeing it,\" he replied. \"They were sure that their seeing was going to give them answers to age-old questions. You see, they figured that if they unraveled the secrets of the rolling force they would be invulnerable and immortal. The sad part is that in one way or another, they did unravel the secrets and yet they were neither invulnerable nor immortal. \n\n\"The new seers changed it all by realizing that there is no way to aspire to immortality as long \nas man has a cocoon.\" \n\nDon Juan explained that the old seers apparently never realized that the human cocoon is a receptacle and cannot sustain the onslaught of the rolling force forever. In spite of all the knowledge that they had accumulated, they were in the end certainly no better, and perhaps much worse, off than the average man. \n\n\"In what way were they left worse off than the average man?\" I asked. \n\n\"Their tremendous knowledge forced them to take it for granted that their choices were \ninfallible,\" he said. \"So they chose to live at any cost.\" \n\nDon Juan looked at me and smiled. With his theatrical pause he was telling me something I \ncould not fathom. \n\n\"They chose to live,\" he repeated. \"Just as they chose to become trees in order to assemble \nworlds with those nearly unreachable great bands.\" \n\n\"What do you mean by that, don Juan?\" \n\n\"I mean that they used the rolling force to shift their assemblage points to unimaginable \ndreaming positions, instead of letting it roll them to the beak of the Eagle to be devoured.\"", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gujq6oo", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;3rd quote:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re such an exaggerated fellow.&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;The rolling force is not that bad.

The sad part is that in one way or another, they did unravel the secrets and yet they were neither invulnerable nor immortal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The new seers changed it all by realizing that there is no way to aspire to immortality as long \nas man has a cocoon.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan explained that the old seers apparently never realized that the human cocoon is a receptacle and cannot sustain the onslaught of the rolling force forever. In spite of all the knowledge that they had accumulated, they were in the end certainly no better, and perhaps much worse, off than the average man. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In what way were they left worse off than the average man?&amp;quot; I asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Their tremendous knowledge forced them to take it for granted that their choices were \ninfallible,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;So they chose to live at any cost.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan looked at me and smiled. With his theatrical pause he was telling me something I \ncould not fathom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They chose to live,&amp;quot; he repeated. &amp;quot;Just as they chose to become trees in order to assemble \nworlds with those nearly unreachable great bands.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you mean by that, don Juan?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I mean that they used the rolling force to shift their assemblage points to unimaginable \ndreaming positions, instead of letting it roll them to the beak of the Eagle to be devoured.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild":

I'm not afraid of frightening anymore.\"\n\nI have no idea who that was.

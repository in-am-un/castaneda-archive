It's like being told, your sperm count is too low to conceive.\n\nI hope my prejudice isn\u2019t showing there.\n\nBut there\u2019s some good news in it all.\n\nFor one thing, stalkers get to go shopping more often!\n\nJust ask Florinda and Taisha. One day Carlos was very worried, and announced they were gone.\n\nVanished.\n\nLost in the second attention.\n\nThey turned up the next day and said, \u201cWe went shopping!\u201d\n\nThat means you have at least that to look forward to, if you have to be a stalker.\n\nBut also,  in reality, there\u2019s absolutely no difference in how you learn.\n\nBoth stalkers and dreamers take advantage of the same thing.\n\nWhen you are silent, the assemblage point isn\u2019t being forced to hold your current position. It can drift.\n\nBut it won\u2019t unless something gives it a push, or pulls on it. Or both.\n\nYesterday I was looking at some Chi Gung moves.\n\nOne involved gyrating your hips while you let your upper body roll with it.\n\nThe person doing the movement got really exaggerated, until his body was waving around like it was made out of rubber.\n\nHe had a wicked grin on his face as he asked, \u201cIs your Tensegrity like this????\u201d\n\nHe was making fun of one or the other. Probably Chi Gung, since he hasn\u2019t seen any actual tensegrity.\n\nBut instead of agreeing that Chi Gung was silly, I had to tell him the truth.\n\n\"That would work!\", I said. \"You could change worlds doing that movement\".\n\nHe had a look of puzzlement on his face, so that night I gave it a try just to make sure I hadn't told a mistruth.\n\nSure enough, wiggling like that frees up a **lot** of energy, which you can redeploy to assemble another world.\n\nIt may not be well designed to make good use of that energy, as is also true of some kungfu moves Cholita practices, learned from Howard.\n\nThey don't have the same purpose as those designed by Carlos.\n\nSo doing them over time, won't have the same effect as Tensegrity.\n\nBut they will work enough to free up energy needed to assemble another world.\n\nYou just have to be silent long enough that your assemblage point is very loose.\n\nOne might define Tensegrity as the control of the energy of awareness.\n\nA way to redeploy it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s true. But if you think that\u2019s all of what it is, you\u2019re missing the magic of being human.\n\nWe\u2019re like super fine radios which can tune in hundreds of stations (worlds).\n\nWe don\u2019t have an actual knob to select the radio station.\n\nIt\u2019s a psychic interface.  You think it, and the dial moves until it finds that station.  It moves through *intent*.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the problem. We picked up this nagging voice in our heads, telling us which station we must listen to.\n\nIn fact, according to that nagging voice, there's only one radio station.  Even looking for more is delusional.\n\nPeople write entire articles and propose biographies, based on how delusional it is to assume there's other radio stations.\n\nIt's maddening (literally).\n\nIt\u2019s like having a \"spiritual\" girlfriend who controls the radio in your car, and only listens to Jesus Freak music.\n\nWe\u2019re screwed.\n\nBut get rid of the girlfriend, and you can choose whatever station you like.\n\nThat\u2019s the internal dialogue. Get rid of it.\n\nOnce you do, any tensegrity move can be enough to push the assemblage point.\n\nNotice I said push.  That's the method Tensegrity uses.  It's a little like the \"Nagual's Blow\".\n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of long forms, but I\u2019m absolutely convinced you could start a tensegrity move in this world, end up in another in the middle, and finish in an entirely different world at the end.\n\nI'm waiting for lovely Yulia Chi to learn to do that.  She could.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMBZH\\_xWh2g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMBZH_xWh2g)\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t happen yet, because no one can get silent.  Or at least if someone made it work, I never got the memo.\n\nBut it does. I've done it at workshops.\n\nIn the case of Tensegrity, the assemblage point is being pushed.\n\nIt's also possible to pull on it.  But Tensegrity isn't primarily designed for that.\n\nOur assemblage point also gets a burst of new energy, at the new positions it takes on while doing tensegrity.\n\nSo once it gets moving, it will keep moving if you remain silent and continue the Tensegrity.\n\nIt\u2019s like trying to move something heavy. Once you get it sliding, it\u2019s easier to keep it moving.\n\nBut at first, it\u2019s stuck.\n\nWhat it feels like when it starts moving, is key to making Tensegrity work.\n\nYou have to learn that feeling.  If you're just doing the tensegrity because Julio in front of you has a cute butt, it won't work.  Julio might feel a tingle, but you won't.\n\nIt's the same with my simple silence technique.\n\nYou need to learn what it feels like when the assemblage point moves, so you do that more.\n\nThat example is how to **push** the assemblage point  using Tensegrity, but using darkness to find colors, is a method to **pull** on it.\n\nIt\u2019s pulled by the second attention.  A tug of war begins, between your Tonal, and your Nagual.\n\nYou get silent, and the radio dial is released (the bad girlfriend leaves the car).\n\nBut it\u2019s still on the Jesus freak music.\n\nSo you look around for a billboard.  Anything that suggests a musical group, so your psychic interface can activate.\n\nWhat do you see?\n\nPrince doing Purple Rain!\n\nAll you have to do is gaze at his dazzling purple awesomeness, and you've selected a new station.\n\nIn the real world however, you get perfectly silent in darkness, look for colors, and play with them.\n\nYou find a puff of purple color in the darkness and interact with it.\n\nIf you keep it up, you can even make a mini-Prince ride along on the puff of color for you.\n\n(Adopt an inorganic being the way I did with my Fairy.)\n\nWith silence, that\u2019ll pull the assemblage point along to where it\u2019s easier to see the purple, and easier to interact with it.\n\nEven without mini-Prince.\n\nI've been asked if we really need mini-Prince (inorganic beings).\n\nAnd isn't he evil anyway?\n\nThe ones giving out Dr. Pepper are evil.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf7-wrzpN3U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf7-wrzpN3U)\n\nThe rest have no opinions on anything, other than that you're the best fan ever, and thank you for coming to their concert!\n\nYou chose a new station with your actions, by watching the purple color.\n\nBut what\u2019s a **stalker** to do?\n\nStuck in daylight, nothing seen in darkness, and no reason weird Kungfu moves are going to be pushing on things right now, because your tensegrity shoes are at home.\n\nIt\u2019s just you walking around in the hostile world, trapped at your current position of the assemblage point.\n\nNot to worry.  Get silent so that your assemblage point is loose.\n\nThen get rid of the girlfriend.   It\u2019s the same basic thing.\n\nBut the girlfriend is you this time.\n\nGet rid of you.\n\nIt\u2019s \"you\" that\u2019s making it remain in the undesirable location.\n\nEven if you get rid of the internal dialogue girlfriend,  you still reek of \"you\", her favorite perfume.\n\nChange yourself to someone else!\n\nThat removes the latent images from our mind also.  You're not only silent, but you also aren't fantasizing about \"you\".\n\nIf you\u2019re completely silent, there\u2019s no way your assemblage point can remain where it was.\n\nHow far do you have to go with this stalking?\n\nYou can\u2019t just tell everyone you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re the opposite sex now.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough.  Sorry guys.  You might become more popular that way, but it won't make you a sorcerer.\n\nA new suit isn\u2019t going to do it either.\n\nI've always fancied Zoot suits.   With a big chain attached to a silver pocket watch, of course.\n\nAnd with a decent roach hidden in the watch.\n\nWell, just for effect.  A zoot suit requires weed.\n\nThat new zoot suit, a transgender announcement, new exciting gay friends,  in a new city, just might do the trick!\n\nThat\u2019s stalking.  But you REALLY have to take on the part.\n\nYou change the world so that it pushes and rubs on you in a different manner.\n\nOops . If forgot what example I was giving.  Skip the rubbing and you\u2019ll be fine. It's over quicker if you only enlist the pushing.\n\nBut the stalking has to be complete, to guarantee your assemblage point will move.\n\nYou can't be thinking, \"Man I don't like progressives\", while you're doing it.\n\nYou have to be more like, \"If Trump comes in here, I'll get my *little friend* to deal with him!\"\n\nI forgot to mention.   A zoot suit also requires a switch blade.\n\nCrazy Josefina used to get into stalking so much that she got carried away. She really became the part, and forgot she ought not to attack the other apprentices for real.\n\nCarlos tried to create a stalking bubble around the inner circle. People were married to other people, but not really, people were misidentified so they could take on a new identity, and in general became very secretive, all around.\n\nPeople were so aware of his bubble, that some tried to penetrate it with video cameras.\n\nIf they couldn't be special, no one could!\n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of stalking bubbles for groups, but it could work.\n\nMaybe Carlos just had too big of a group to control. It created its own dynamics, which forced their assemblage points to get sticky again.  They got stuck to pieces of the new bubble.\n\nIt\u2019s part of the reason he was so bothered when he found people in classes chasing each other, for ordinary mating purposes.\n\nHe was trying to keep everyone in a bubble, where their assemblage point could be moved.\n\nAnd just when he had it sliding a little, so pushing it would be easier, someone put on the brakes.\n\nBut if they hadn't, it might have worked.\n\nYou might even say, stalking is the most efficient way of all to move the assemblage point.\n\nIt doesn't just push it, as Tensegrity does. It doesn't just pull on it, as dreaming does.\n\nIt both pushes and pulls.\n\nBut you still need to learn silence.\n\nEdited: six times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "OMG, I\u2019m not a Dreamer: I have to be a Stalker!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Stalking"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ed2s3f", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Stalking", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1576809515.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1576804613.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever had a bad day, where you&amp;#39;re sitting on the toilet because it&amp;#39;s the only dark place you can manage in your house, and  after weeks of trying, you realize you just aren\u2019t going to find any purple puffs of light to do tensegrity chops on?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so maybe you\u2019re a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;stalker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; type?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shit!

It&amp;#39;s over quicker if you only enlist the pushing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the stalking has to be complete, to guarantee your assemblage point will move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t be thinking, &amp;quot;Man I don&amp;#39;t like progressives&amp;quot;, while you&amp;#39;re doing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to be more like, &amp;quot;If Trump comes in here, I&amp;#39;ll get my &lt;em&gt;little friend&lt;/em&gt; to deal with him!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forgot to mention.   A zoot suit also requires a switch blade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crazy Josefina used to get into stalking so much that she got carried away. She really became the part, and forgot she ought not to attack the other apprentices for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos tried to create a stalking bubble around the inner circle. People were married to other people, but not really, people were misidentified so they could take on a new identity, and in general became very secretive, all around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People were so aware of his bubble, that some tried to penetrate it with video cameras.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they couldn&amp;#39;t be special, no one could!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not a big fan of stalking bubbles for groups, but it could work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe Carlos just had too big of a group to control. It created its own dynamics, which forced their assemblage points to get sticky again.  They got stuck to pieces of the new bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s part of the reason he was so bothered when he found people in classes chasing each other, for ordinary mating purposes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was trying to keep everyone in a bubble, where their assemblage point could be moved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And just when he had it sliding a little, so pushing it would be easier, someone put on the brakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if they hadn&amp;#39;t, it might have worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might even say, stalking is the most efficient way of all to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t just push it, as Tensegrity does. It doesn&amp;#39;t just pull on it, as dreaming does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It both pushes and pulls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you still need to learn silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: six

You use something complex or hard to recognize, to puzzle the tonal.\n\nThen the Nagual can come out.  You gaze at it to move the assemblage point.\n\nYou can use ferns because of the complex interplay of light and dark.  You blur your eyes slightly, or perhaps find a way to make it hard to understand.\n\nIt should work just as well as gazing at colors in the darkness, except that you're in daylight. And so when your assemblage point shifts, you're kind of tied to remaining there gazing.  If you get up and move on, all the bright lights will return your assemblage point to its normal position.\n\nMore or less that is.  How long you can keep your assemblage point at a new location varies by how you moved it.\n\nCarlos used stalking and not-doing among his inner circle, to move their assemblage points.  I suspect that required some personalized tinkering on his part, such as how he dealt with Cholita.\n\nHe brought a woman or two up to the front, to explain how they'd moved their assemblage points to a place where it could remain for days, or even weeks.\n\nI suspect no one took him seriously on that, because they were fairly new young women, and there wasn't any obvious sign their assemblage point had moved so much.\n\nBut he might just as well have been not-doing and *intending*, during that explanation.\n\nAlso, my emphasis on cross dressing in that post wasn't just for fun.  I'm trying to dispel the idea that sorcerers are saints, holy people, better than they were before they started, or whatever impression the me-too Naguals like to give their students, in order to secure more workshop customers.\n\nWhen you hear how a me-too Nagual is so \"this\", or wonderful, \"that\", you've probably got a fake sorcerer.  He's selling himself, not sorcery.\n\nCarlos was rumored to have cross dressed some men, and even put them up on stage naked.\n\nBut the king of bad behavior was the Nagual Julian.  When I suggested skipping the rubbing and going for the pushing to get it over with, I had him in mind.\n\nHere's what I've seen about how long you can keep the assemblage point moved (and you'll be able to feel that it's still moved for this duration):\n\nTensegrity:  4-6 hours depending on how miserable your internal dialogue is.\n\nStalking: 2 weeks is a piece of cake. It's the most stable way to move the assemblage point.\n\nDreaming: 1 day.  But that's all you need, because nighttime comes around every 24 hours!\n\nGazing: 30 minutes\n\nWhat does it feel like?\n\nA cocaine high, or at least from what I've seen of coke users, it's very much as they seem to feel and behave.\n\nCholita likens it to a strong cup of coffee, but without the jitters.  A \"high\" that makes you happy and alert, but not wired.\n\nThat's not surprising. Drugs (power plants) still have to use the same body we use when not high, so the effects will tend to be similar or somehow familiar.\n\nIt's all about moving the assemblage point, and the results will be similar when it's moved to similar positions.\n\nI know it's nutty to give those times, and it's only my personal experience.  But I have in fact moved it by all of these methods, and that's my experience on how long it can last, given a specific triggering technique.\n\nUnfortunately, stalking is the supreme champion of moving the assemblage point.  It's just such a pain in the ass.\n\nBut it's also the easiest way to be practicing all the time, instead of trying to cram 3 hours in, at 2AM.\n\nFinally, there's the \"impeccable warrior\" thing.  In that case, you do all of them, all the time.\n\nAll methods. Any chance you find, all day long.\n\nTrouble with that is, it's hard enough to get someone to practice for an  hour, sitting comfortably in a chair with their eyes closed.\n\nI can't see the \"impeccable warrior\" thing working out, unless you're in a party of impeccable warriors, all of them enforcing the idea that you have to work all the time.\n\nCarlos tried that, but it didn't seem to work very well.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1576868521.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fbh0mly", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I missed gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gazing is like looking for colors in the darkness.

If you get up and move on, all the bright lights will return your assemblage point to its normal position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More or less that is.  How long you can keep your assemblage point at a new location varies by how you moved it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos used stalking and not-doing among his inner circle, to move their assemblage points.  I suspect that required some personalized tinkering on his part, such as how he dealt with Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He brought a woman or two up to the front, to explain how they&amp;#39;d moved their assemblage points to a place where it could remain for days, or even weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect no one took him seriously on that, because they were fairly new young women, and there wasn&amp;#39;t any obvious sign their assemblage point had moved so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he might just as well have been not-doing and &lt;em&gt;intending&lt;/em&gt;, during that explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, my emphasis on cross dressing in that post wasn&amp;#39;t just for fun.  I&amp;#39;m trying to dispel the idea that sorcerers are saints, holy people, better than they were before they started, or whatever impression the me-too Naguals like to give their students, in order to secure more workshop customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you hear how a me-too Nagual is so &amp;quot;this&amp;quot;, or wonderful, &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;ve probably got a fake sorcerer.  He&amp;#39;s selling himself, not sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was rumored to have cross dressed some men, and even put them up on stage naked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the king of bad behavior was the Nagual Julian.  When I suggested skipping the rubbing and going for the pushing to get it over with, I had him in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve seen about how long you can keep the assemblage point moved (and you&amp;#39;ll be able to feel that it&amp;#39;s still moved for this duration):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity:  4-6 hours depending on how miserable your internal dialogue is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stalking: 2 weeks is a piece of cake. It&amp;#39;s the most stable way to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dreaming: 1 day.  But that&amp;#39;s all you need, because nighttime comes around every 24 hours!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gazing: 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does it feel like?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A cocaine high, or at least from what I&amp;#39;ve seen of coke users, it&amp;#39;s very much as they seem to feel and behave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita likens it to a strong cup of coffee, but without the jitters.  A &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; that makes you happy and alert, but not wired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not surprising. Drugs (power plants) still have to use the same body we use when not high, so the effects will tend to be similar or somehow familiar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all about moving the assemblage point, and the results will be similar when it&amp;#39;s moved to similar positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s nutty to give those times, and it&amp;#39;s only my personal experience.  But I have in fact moved it by all of these methods, and that&amp;#39;s my experience on how long it can last, given a specific triggering technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, stalking is the supreme champion of moving the assemblage point.  It&amp;#39;s just such a pain in the ass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s also the easiest way to be practicing all the time, instead of trying to cram 3 hours in, at 2AM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, there&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;impeccable warrior&amp;quot; thing.  In that case, you do all of them, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All methods. Any chance you find, all day long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trouble with that is, it&amp;#39;s hard enough to get someone to practice for an  hour, sitting comfortably in a chair with their eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t see the &amp;quot;impeccable warrior&amp;quot; thing working out, unless you&amp;#39;re in a party of impeccable warriors, all of them enforcing the idea that you have to work all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos tried that, but it didn&amp;#39;t seem to work very well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ed2s3f/omg_im_not_a_dreamer_i_have_to_be_a_stalker/fbh0mly/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1576862892.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ed2s3f", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fbhb4pr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fbh2dqw", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "So let's talk about that.

I spent endless hours trying to make her more real looking.\n\nAt first I thought the same thing most people will think, when meeting their first IOB.\n\nWhat do you feed them?\n\nWell, that's after the other first thought; \"Oh MY GOD!!!  THIS DAMNED THING IS REEAAALLLLL....!!!\"\n\nI presumed they like to eat purple puffs of light, seeing as how those are supposed to be our own \"energy\" which we can redeploy.\n\nAnd since inorganic beings are evil bastards who want to eat us alive (at least in the Eastern Bloc), it made sense they like to eat purple stuff.\n\nI discovered that Fairy would fly from purple puff to purple puff, pointing out the brightest ones.  She was almost like one of those truffle sniffing pigs.  You have to let them eat a truffle once in a while, or they rebel and won't help you find them anymore.\n\nAnd it worked!  But I completely missed the point.\n\nFairy had become my friend. She was helping me.\n\nAnd that's the best way to deal with inorganic beings, if you want them to be realistic looking.\n\nYou can make them your friend in multiple ways. One is to make them into your teacher, by letting them help you design a tensegrity combination.\n\nUnfortunately, after several weeks and pages and pages of cellphone notes, Fancy isn't satisfied with the form she's been teaching me.\n\nAfter being blinded by repeatedly turning on my cellphone to take notes, she must have noticed I looked frustrated.\n\nSo she taught me another \"quicky\" technique.\n\nBut that one is not suitable for bed gazers.  You practically have to have a tennis court for that technique.\n\nI modified it for bed ridden sorcerers.  You can do it sitting cross-legged, and perhaps even under a blanket or in a cardboard box.\n\nBefore you can do this, you have to at the very least be able to scoop up very bright puffs of color.\n\nAnd, your IOB has to be making at least guest appearances.\n\nGiven that, just ping the balls of light back and forth between your hands, and when your IOB decides to ride the puffs and is looking quite real, raise the puff up on your hand and toss it out.\n\nWatch carefully as it finishes traveling out.  Then lift the opposite hand, palm up, to signal to her that you want her to return to the other hand.\n\nI played this game for 5 hours last night.  At least, I lost 4 hours, and can remember 1 of them.\n\nThis is 100% horizontal (lateral) assemblage point shifting, according to Fancy.  True, you might slide in depth, but focusing the attention on specifics in darkroom gazing tends to tug it horizontally, to make whatever you are watching more interactive.\n\nYou might notice Fancy is full body size in one picture, covering her face with her hands.\n\nIt was an invitation to dance. I reached in, put my hands on her shoulder, and brought her close to me.\n\nThat's where I lost the 4 hours.  Fancy taught me some IOB dance moves.\n\nBut it's all gone now.\n\nI forgot the \"side-effect\" of inorganic being ping-pong.\n\nAfter a while, they begin to speak to you.  And no, it's not vague.\n\nFancy told me three things.  But they're all lost now.\n\nThey were like this:\n\n\"Down at the bottom it gets crusty.\"\n\nThe sentences were correct, but here was no context for them.

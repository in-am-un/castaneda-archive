The entire area in front of me was now an off white color.  Like a sheet of paper.\n\nI was surprised, and gazed down and to the right, to find the source of light.  There was a bright yellow triangle generating the scene.

Our raft on our back was already heavy enough.\n\nI believe, when you get suck in an abstract view inorganic beings are involved. Perhaps they deviate your movement so that they can feed off new energy.\n\nAnd it doesn't really hurt you, except to waste a bunch of your practice time. I have to add that, for the sake of IOB haters.\n\nThey're our teachers, not our enemies!\n\nI don't know how long I was stuck like that, until Cholita quietly closed her bedroom door.\n\nA very unusual thing.\n\nUsually she bangs both of her bedroom doors, one after the other,  then snaps the lock button shut with as much noise as she can, to let me know she isn't happy. And I'm not allowed in.  Occasionally she'll move her dresser to block the door also.\n\nThis time, it seems she didn't want me to know she was moving around.\n\nHer sister died a day or two ago.  She's planning to return to Mexico.\n\nI snapped out of it, and looked at the circles.\n\nThey were like hoops, not puffs.  And perfectly formed, as if a computer had drawn them in the air.  The line of the circle was fairly wide, and the inside was empty.  The colors were pastel blue, red, green, and yellow.  Or perhaps, the last color was not yellow, but impossible to describe in any other way.\n\nThey separated to simulate a specific shape, which was more suitable for silence.

It looked like a little galaxy, or a moderately dense patch of dim but thick stars. They were different colors.\n\nIt began to glow brighter, and the face of a woman materialized in the middle. I could feel a release of energy as it materialized, giving me the sensation of rippling and expanding water.\n\nI said out loud, \"Oh, Hi...  Welcome!  Who are you?\"\n\nA body formed below the head, made of strange looking machine parts.  I suppose the closest thing to match what it looked like would be a Sphinx.\n\nI said to the strange figure, \"Can I call you Sphinx?\"\n\nShe smiled.\n\nThe world of the walking men overtook the bed, and I was surrounded. They were marching across where my legs had been laying.\n\nI was no longer in my bedroom.\n\nThe sun came up.  I was out of time.\n\nI checked the house. Cholita was not inside.

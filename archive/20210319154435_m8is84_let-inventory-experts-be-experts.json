It's ok to mark the post as spoiler though, what made me delete my previous post is the fact that I cannot leave comments in my own post after it was marked as a spoiler.

Dan accused me of being a what's called in this subreddit a bad player. Either the conclusion came from the fact that I made a post that fell under the category of inventory expert or based on the personal details I shared with him in DM thinking he being an experienced practitioner can give me an advice on my issue or maybe because I used the word \"journey\" in the post that wasn't about J curve.\n  \n\n  \nHowever a couple of things made me wanted to make this post:\n  \n\n  \nAfter talking to Dan I saw the IOB I met a few years ago in my dream, the IOB I believe wanted to give me some sort of a hint. This and a few other related things happening in my life were unordinary and made me reconsider my acquaintance with this sub\n  \nI've been reading Dan's posts for a few months before making my first post and after reading more and more (including wiki) in the last few days I can't deny that this subreddit has a few outstanding differences compared to others (I've been a part of non-English non-reddit castaneda communities over the last few years). I think this subreddit has a very well organized practical knowledge on how to experience things that cannot be explained with the reason (e.g. dark room gazing) and high-quality explanatory contents on assemblage point movements and J curve (this was completely new to me). Illustrations especially are just next-level\n  \nI believe that you (mods) are missing a few things with your policy of locking posts and outing anyone who does not post about \"real magic\". I first practiced some sort of dark room gazing \\~5 years ago: I sat in a dark room with closed eyes for hours and tried to look in front of me while filtering imagery before my eyes as imagined to keep only what's \"real\". This way I came to seeing a some sort of white smoke around me, first it was a white swirl in front of my eyes, then more and more, like evaporation smoke around me. I was stunned how easy it was and shared my experience online but no one answered me with anything useful and after some time I lost interest to this practice. This and many other extraordinary things including meeting and having a conversation with IOB happened to me throughout the years. However, it did not really change much. So what, these things do exists, now what? Not much, you still have to live your life, you still have all these situations you're involved in, all these unresolved and uncovered issues of your life. What I think really changed me is 3 years of recapitulation. That was the hardest energy-consuming work I've ever done in my life, there have been days that I felt like an empty shell because it takes so much energy when done properly, sometimes you can do recapitulation for hours, sometimes (when you know what you're doing) you spend so much energy in 15 minutes that you need days to fully recover.\n  \n\n  \nI know, you people (who run this subreddit) probably have been practicing nagualism for tens of years and warrior's path is nothing for you, because you've done all the work, have an impeccable tonal and now interested only in assemblage point movements and integrating these moves. However, recapitulation is also some sort of assemblage point movement, probably not that interesting for you but you have to start somewhere. And besides, from my experience, it takes a lot of effort to get from reading Carlos's books to performing a deep recapitulation. Not many people here visited Castaneda's private classes, many people after reading the books probably think that it was a good fantasy book or think that Castaneda was a fraud (making up fliers does not really help).\n  \n\n  \nDo you really think that after seeing some colors in dark room gazing or meeting an IOB will make a person interested in magic for life, and perhaps it can inspire some but I don't think it will hold. And even so, do you think that it's ok for any person to start practicing magic without a proper strong tonal? She will probably just end up in a mental hospital. I personally believe that the first N abstract cores are not about moving your assemblage points and J curve, they're about learning about yourself, your life, paying out debts, in our other words cleaning up your tonal while gradually becoming aware of nagual. This way everything comes naturally.\n  \n\n  \nAnd about inventory experts \u2013 let them be the experts, maybe they are experts only in your head. You took my deleted post more seriously than I am, the only reason I wrote it is to not think about it, to get it out of my head, that's something I can't help with, that's like a song in the head of a musician, you have to get it out or it will bother your forever:\n  \n\n  \nThe mastery of awareness is what gives the assemblage point its boost. After all, there is really very little to us human beings; we are, in essence, an assemblage point fixed at a certain position. Our enemy and at the same time our friend is our internal dialogue, our inventory. Be a warrior; shut off your internal dialogue; make your inventory and then throw it away. The new seers make accurate inventories and then laugh at them. Without the inventory the assemblage point becomes free.\n  \n\n  \nFor the record it took me hours to write that post and I deleted it completely (no backups) without hesitation when I found out I can't leave comments in my post.\n  \n\n  \nP.S.

Animal fear is what attracts\n\nthem the most; it releases the kind of energy that suits them. The emanations inside them are\n\nrallied by animal fear. Since my fear was relentless the ally went after it, or rather, my fear\n\nhooked the ally and didn't let it go.\"\n\nHe said that it was the old seers who found out that allies enjoy animal fear more than\n\nanything else. They even went to the extreme of purposely feeding it to their allies by actually\n\nscaring people to death. The old seers were convinced that the allies had human feelings, but the\n\nnew seers *saw* it differently. They *saw* that allies are attracted to the energy released by emotions;\n\nlove is equally effective, as well as hatred, or sadness.\n\nDon Juan added that if he had felt love for that ally, the ally would have come after him\n\nanyway, although the chase would have had a different mood. I asked him whether the ally would\n\nhave stopped going after him if he had controlled his fear. He answered that controlling fear was\n\na trick of the old seers. They learned to control it to the point of being able to parcel it out. They\n\nhooked their allies with their own fear and by gradually doling it out like food, they actually held\n\nthe allies in bondage.\n\n\"Those old seers were terrifying men,\" don Juan continued. \"I shouldn't use the past tense -\n\nthey are terrifying even today. Their bid is to dominate, to master everybody and everything.\"\n\n\"Even today, don Juan?\" I asked, trying to get him to explain further.\n\nHe changed the subject by commenting that I had missed the opportunity of being really\n\nscared beyond measure. He said that doubtless the way I had sealed the frame of the mirror with\n\ntar had prevented the water from seeping behind the glass. He counted that as the deciding factor\n\nthat had kept the ally from smashing the mirror.\n\n\"Too bad,\" he said. \"You might even have liked that ally. By the way, it was not the same one\n\nthat came the day before. The second one was perfectly akin to you.\"\n\n\"Don't you have some allies yourself, don Juan?\" I asked.\n\n\"As you know, I have my benefactor's allies,\" he said. \"I can't say that I have the same feeling\n\nfor them that my benefactor did. He was a serene but thoroughly passionate man, who lavishly\n\ngave away everything he possessed, including his energy. He loved his allies. To him it was no\n\nsweat to allow the allies to use his energy and materialize themselves.

Anyone who counts on you to keep their miserable situation more tolerable, will try to stop you from escaping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And following intent requires entering &amp;quot;edifices&amp;quot;.  Like Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you get at least 30% more problems practicing sorcery than if you didn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But perhaps 60% of the normal ones no longer seem important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re slightly better off is all I&amp;#39;d say. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happens when you get as powerful as don Juan or Silvio Manuel, I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Taisha&amp;#39;s books she says they have &amp;quot;absolute control over reality&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That might be nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we should be careful not to carry over the crap from the other systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, the leader who dies and his body does not decay. That&amp;#39;s an old yogi claim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their teacher has to be magical, perfect, can&amp;#39;t suffer ever, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People try to apply that to sorcery.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally since it comes from a fake system, applying it to the real thing is a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they did any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos largely got trashed because he got sick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It upset the groupies, who did what groupies do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They kept being groupies. Except now they were attack groupies, instead of supporter groupies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hangers on (needing a place to live more than anything else), seem to have faired the best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still none of them practices anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to find at least one who saw the J curve demo, to try to get more details of what happens at various levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita estimated 50 were there that day.  Including the young woman he traced his finger on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But none who will talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished":

I decided not to have dinner, and go straight to the dark room. Food makes me feel very heavy and sleepy.\n\nAfter half an hour of tensegrity and playing with colors, I reached heightened awareness.\n\nThe first few times, I adored that feeling of knowing everything. But now it's a bit annoying! Mainly when you want to translate everything into words. I think that's the enemy \"clarity\". To pass it, you have to know how much energy to use in it. Since every time you try to formulate it, a little internal dialogue comes back, and when you remember, you are in your normal position again. That is why it takes energy away. It is taking something from the silent to the rational point.\n\nI was quite deep there, really dreaming. I understood Dan's references to \"50% in my dreaming double\". I think I've been 50%. You don't notice the change. But you are increasingly surrounded by magic, and become part of your dream.\n\nMagic you interact with. One of the most incredible things I saw, was a fairy flying and jumping between my hands. Every movement she made, left sparkles in her wake. Fully animated.\n\nI don't have time to draw pictures right now, but I saw complete detailed walls around me, and dense colored clouds. There were also worlds, and almost got sorrounded by one!\n\nImagine an astral proyection, with all the crazy stuff you can find there, but completly awake, with the eyes opened, so you can make it last as much as you want.\n\nI found that when you decide to leave the internal dialogue even more, you can switch to \"seeing energy\" mode and reach more intense happiness. Maybe it would be deeper heightened awareness? That's when you get the \"enlightened\" feelings.\n\nOne of the things I found out is related to something we talked about yesterday. On the private subreddit, I shared a quote from N\u00e9lida saying that there was a \"fast way\", where you can skip the recapitulation, if you manage to wake up the double. I'll put the quote below.\n\nIt is like this: what you have to do is gain some experience in the dark room. Enough to recognize movements of the assemblage point. All you have to do next, is be very fluent and pay attention. No matter how much you are in heightened awareness, you will continue having bad habits. But you have a goal, which is to move the assemblage point. Identify everything that takes you away from that goal, wich means, that goes against your flow. Can be anything. From habits to ways of thinking.\n\nIf you're light enough to get this right, and change whatever is necessary, you don't need to recap. In fact, if you make this work, you already understand what the recap is for, so you can skip it.\n\nLet me say that if that's not the case, just recap. Do it, and it will worth it, because you are going to learn real sorcery.\n\nBut maybe the most important advice for you is to learn to reach heightened awareness. There, everything is so obvious. You will find a way to solve every trouble you are having. Or you can listen to the world around you, and find what decision to take (yes, you can understand omens).\n\nThe quote from Taisha's new book:\n\n\"\\[...\\] - Do your cravings ever stop? \"Yes, by emptying our warehouse through recapitulation, we break the hold that concretion has over us,\" she said. There is a faster way. The energy body can suddenly wake up and see that \\* the self \\* is not important. A person who frees himself from the limitations of self-reflection will perceive in a totally different way.\"\n\n\"You just need to give up your ideas of \u200b\u200bthe world.\" But that's it. Because it is our ideas that fix us and make us concrete. And you might ask why do we have to give up our ideas to be free? Because our ideas are limiting, while energy has no limits.

It had been gone for more than 100 years.\n\nPeople have discussed how to tell if you\u2019re dreaming in many places on the internet. The lucid dreaming forum has multiple recommendations.  My favorite is to jump up.  The landing hurts at least a little, if it\u2019s not a dream. And the speed at which you fall will be wrong.\n\nBut how do you tell if you\u2019re asleep?\n\nThat\u2019s not as odd of a question as it seems, if you practice sorcery.   According to don Juan in \u201cThe Fire From Within\u201d:\n\n\u2018Don Juan had said that technically, as soon as the assemblage point shifts, we are asleep. I wondered, for instance, if I was sound asleep from the stand of an onlooker, just as Genaro had been asleep to me. I asked don Juan about it as soon as he returned. \"You are absolutely asleep without having to be stretched out,\" he replied. \"If people in a normal state of awareness saw you now, you would appear to them to be a bit dizzy, even drunk.\"\u2019\n\nIn one private class, Carlos traced a very long path the assemblage point could move, using one of the two women he said had just that week accomplished that movement.  It was from between the shoulder blades, down the back, around and up just below the crotch, and then back to the front, a little lower and closer to the solar plexus.    Although he didn\u2019t say so, that also puts it closer to the assemblage point of the second attention, which is just a foot or two lower and to the right.\n\nAt the time I didn\u2019t understand how it could have moved so much, without the women seeming any different.  I didn\u2019t get any chances to talk to them about it, but they seemed pretty much the same as before.\n\nLast night, I found out how far it could move without being detected.  I was walking around the local Korean area, because I liked how different things looked there, compared to what I was used to.  It\u2019s conducive to silence to be in a place that feels different.  There\u2019s slightly less to capture your attention, and stir up the internal dialogue.  Even the movements of the non-westernized Korean people shopping there were different than I was used to. As a result, I couldn\u2019t fathom what they were thinking and had nothing to ponder.\n\nI spent 2 or 3 hours walking around in silence.  I was able to get to the point that it was peaceful instead of unpleasant, and I sustained that most of the time.  That in itself was an accomplishment for me, when walking around.  I usually get to that level of silence only when alone in darkness, or only when walking around for very small bursts.\n\nLater that night I tried to sit up on the bed to stare at colors, but I still have traces of a virus and was too tired to do it.  It\u2019s been that way for several days.  I decided to rest and see if I could do it later.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of the night I finally felt like I could do it.  But instead of looking for colors, I was trying to use mantric meditation to get to Samadhi (bliss) so that I could be a bit more comfortable staring at colors for a few hours.\n\nAs soon as I started repeating the mantra, my breath got deep and automatic, and my head fell forward onto my chest, in the most uncomfortable position possible.  It didn\u2019t slowly fall forward. It slumped as if someone had shoved it forward.\n\nI had the thought that if I allowed that, I\u2019d fall asleep. Not to mention the eventual pain of letting the chin rest on the chest.  So I lifted my chin up, resumed the mantra, and it immediately slumped back to my chest.   The shock was even jarring my neck.\n\nAfter the 4th time I gave up, lay on my side, and decided to go to sleep. At one point, an unknown number of hours later, I decided to turn on my other side. But I found that I was nearly paralyzed.  I could move, but only very slowly.  It was like I was encased in jello.  I finally had to roll back and forth slowly until I woke up, and that took a while.\n\nThat\u2019s when I realized, I\u2019d been sleep walking since I got home the night before!  Maybe even before that. As long as I kept moving, things seemed normal. But once I stopped for a bit, it became obvious.\n\nI was asleep, but conscious of everything as if awake and so I didn\u2019t notice it.\n\nI wish I\u2019d realized that, when I meditated and my head fell forward. But that\u2019s one thing about the assemblage point. Once it assembles a full world, it tends to feel so normal that you don\u2019t ask questions.  If you\u2019ve been in a very bizarre dream that seemed like the real world to you at the time, then awoken to remember details that were too absurd to be taken seriously, you know that feeling.\n\nI wish I\u2019d also realized that I was asleep while laying on my side, thinking it was time to turn over.  It just seemed like I was enjoying the feeling of lying in bed after having slept, not having to get up yet.  It didn\u2019t feel like I was still asleep.\n\nI wish I hadn\u2019t panicked and rocked back and forth to wake myself up, once I realized I was experiencing mild sleep paralysis.  It didn\u2019t hurt like it usually does, and I was able to move slowly.  I should have taken advantage of sleep walking and tried to get up and move around like that.\n\nThe moral of this story is, if things seem a little awful when practicing, like you have some kind of blockage in your progress, don\u2019t forget to ask if it\u2019s actually more progress than you had been expecting.\n\nEdited twice", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How to Tell if You\u2019re Asleep", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_bj6lql", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1556672514.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1556648104.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to find your hands in dreaming, it\u2019s not uncommon to stop in the middle of a dream, get a curious thought that perhaps you\u2019re dreaming right now, but then look around and be unable to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you dream, your assemblage point has moved to a place where what you\u2019re experiencing feels normal.

She said in a whisper that the church and the town were the results of her intent; they did not exist, yet they did. She added, looking into my eyes, that this is one of the mysteries of intending in the second attention the twin positions of dreaming. It can be done, but it cannot be explained or comprehended.\n\r\nShe told me then that she came from a line of sorcerers who knew how to move about in the second attention by projecting their intent. Her story was that the sorcerers of her line practiced the art of projecting their thoughts in dreaming in order to accomplish the truthful reproduction of any object or structure or landmark or scenery of their choice.\n\r\nShe said that the shamans of her line used to start by gazing at a simple object and memorizing every detail of it. They would then close their eyes and visualize the object and correct their visualization against the true object until they could see it, in its completeness, with their eyes shut.\n\r\nThe next thing in their developing scheme was to dream the object and create in the dream, from the point of view of their own perception, a total materialization of the object. This act, the women said, was called the first step to total perception.\r\nFrom a simple object, those sorcerers went on to take more and more complex items. Their final aim was for all of them together to visualize a total realm, then dream that realm and thus re-create a totally veritable world where they could exist.

She said in a whisper that the church and the town were the results of her intent; they did not exist, yet they did. She added, looking into my eyes, that this is one of the mysteries of intending in the second attention the twin positions of dreaming. It can be done, but it cannot be explained or comprehended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She told me then that she came from a line of sorcerers who knew how to move about in the second attention by projecting their intent. Her story was that the sorcerers of her line practiced the art of projecting their thoughts in dreaming in order to accomplish the truthful reproduction of any object or structure or landmark or scenery of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said that the shamans of her line used to start by gazing at a simple object and memorizing every detail of it. They would then close their eyes and visualize the object and correct their visualization against the true object until they could see it, in its completeness, with their eyes shut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next thing in their developing scheme was to dream the object and create in the dream, from the point of view of their own perception, a total materialization of the object. This act, the women said, was called the first step to total perception.\nFrom a simple object, those sorcerers went on to take more and more complex items. Their final aim was for all of them together to visualize a total realm, then dream that realm and thus re-create a totally veritable world where they could exist.

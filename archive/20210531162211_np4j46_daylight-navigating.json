Just as we can extend it upwards until it's a \"pipe like\" shape, when you shapeshift you bend it horizontally a bit.\n\nLike in that movie series, \"Alien\", when there's an alien in your stomach, trying to push out.\n\nLily claims we do that a little.\n\nI believe if you want to travel between worlds you just need to be where you got, but stop \"recognizing things\".  See them, but don't say, \"oh, that's a lot of green in that fog!\".\n\nOr anything like that.  Remove fantasies completely from your mind.\n\nAny \"narrative flow\" in the mind, has to go.\n\nThen, gaze off the direction you want to travel.\n\nAnd \"forget who you are\".  That's the release.  The letting go part.\n\nBUT, you can't be doing that according to the instructions, because that would be a \"narrative flow\".\n\nA contradiction you just have to solve?  And the solution is, you can't solve it.\n\nYou either realize it's now available, or you don't, and nothing can be done to bring it about.

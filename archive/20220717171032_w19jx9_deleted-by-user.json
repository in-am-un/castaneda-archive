Definitely time to stop. I was planning to anyway but this just definitely sped it up. Then again, let me not sell my self short, when I engage in my practice I either end up in a phantom room or in the \u201cradio\u201d stage. And I typically get somewhere via the wall of fog. I\u2019ve been doing this for probably about a week with the results ending in those stages. So mental masturbation? Not quite. Drugs? A little I won\u2019t lie. Unlike most men I\u2019m not a bitch who seeks attention. So I ask you, are you sure this path won\u2019t work? I know as men we typically like things to be around me me me, but if I\u2019m gonna be honest, I\u2019ve never been the type to boast about what a big dick I have even though it is large. I\u2019m killing that off more and more the more I hear the audio books. I already didn\u2019t care to begin with, but now I\u2019ve greatly lowered my impulsive ass ego and rage. Hell, I won\u2019t sit here and tell you that I\u2019m completely egoless and don\u2019t have a book deal mind. BUT, I will tell you I have made significant progress in shutting that part off whenever it comes up. (and it rarely does at this point) I merely discussed my dream and said it was a dream knowing it has no real magic. The reason why I bothered mentioning it was because I noticed I can stay in dreams longer without fading and cutting somewhere, not to mention it was interesting. It\u2019s different from most of my dreams that are always about fighting or some other weird shit. That\u2019s all, never claimed it to have magic. So kindly, don\u2019t misconstrue my words.

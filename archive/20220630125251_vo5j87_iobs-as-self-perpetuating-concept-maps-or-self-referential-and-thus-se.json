For hours.  Not once a year, or in some random weird situation.\n\nI spent hours last night traveling between worlds, with my IOB friends.  Trying to learn about a 100,000 year old structure created likely by proto-humans.\n\nIt's like we all have actual paying jobs, in this subreddit.\n\nAnd everywhere else the people are unemployed.\n\nJust pretending to have \"job opportunities coming along any day now\".\n\nLike your good for nothing uncle Bob.\n\nWe're on to Bob, that deadbeat!\n\nYou can't interest anyone in here in a theoretical job that might or might not pay in the long run.\n\nAnd it sounds to me like your Russian guy is seriously unemployed.\n\nBut in regards to what you gave us, I don't see any explanation of why they can move objects.\n\nI've seen that more than 30 times.  Right in my face for most of those.\n\nAlso pounding on walls, knocking on doors, making coyote sounds right near your ear.\n\nThey're great poltergeists!\n\nKeep in mind they're fully visible, you can hear them, they speak, and even do tricks or try to scare you.\n\nThey can also allow you to pass through solid walls!  Or leap to distant planets, land for real, fully awake, no drugs, eyes open.\n\nIf you try to use what they taught you in a dangerous way, they'll even stop  you.  Using force if needed.  They have independent goals.\n\nThey tried to kidnap our teacher, when it was clear he was dying. To take him to their world where he could survive his illness for a few million years.\n\nI was there. It's no made up story.  And I asked one of the entities that tried to kidnap him why she did that. She got annoyed and said they wanted to save him, not kidnap him.\n\nLater she designed a \"locator spell\" people in here could use, to summon her.\n\nIt's called, \"Fairy's Pass\" and is in the wiki  If you actually would like to meet one.  But you have to move your \"assemblage\" point down to the middle of the back, or it's unlikely she'll become visible to you.\n\nWe ignore most of reality, as we were taught to do. These particular spirits visit children all the time, but the parents convince the kids they aren't real.\n\nAnd they can be passed on from one sorcerer to another, involuntarily.  For hundreds of years, since they live so long.\n\nThey can be used to scare the hell out of apprentices.\n\nThey'll run errands for you.\n\nI've been sending one down a tunnel to a witch in south America, visibly seeing it go and return.\n\nIt wouldn't do as I wished last night, and taunted me by going back and forth.\n\nTrust me when I say, it doesn't obey my own commands. I have to find something it wants to do also, or it won't help.\n\nIt belongs to my witch friend, who has to \"let it out\" or I don't get to see it at all.\n\nCarlos introduced me to his \"Allies\" around 1998, I forgot about them, and then they started showing up to scare the hell out of me, randomly. For the next 15 years before they finally \"blackmailed\" me to come here and help people learn sorcery.\n\nIt took me a while to figure out they were the ones he had.\n\nSo the idea that it's a product of myself, just doesn't add up.\n\nLittle Smoke follows my witch friend Cholita around in daylight, and is fully visible.\n\nShe's a little puff of intense white smoke, the size of a golf ball.\n\nPushes paper aside in the art supply store after Cholita leaves it to look at something else, and is no longer interested.  It's certainly not doing what she causes it to do.\n\nThey also come and go with new visitors constantly, and older ones not showing up for a long time,  as if they found something else to do.\n\nThey have their own will, and that's obvious once you start to interreact with them for hours a night.  Everyday.\n\nThe key is to stop \"theorizing\" and thinking about them, and actually have them around constantly.  So you can learn what they really are.\n\nCan you show us what type of interaction your expert had?   How often?\n\nHow did he summon them?  How many did he have?\n\nIs there anything written down in detail on how to get them yourself, and also who and how he taught others to do that?\n\nOtherwise, why shouldn't we \"follow Jesus\"?\n\nHe could raise the dead!\n\nYou can't top that.\n\nHe'd tell you they were demons and angels.\n\nWouldn't it be smarter to follow the Olmecs, who lived before money was invented, before any cities existed, and before there was agriculture.\n\nSo they had no way to profit from making up stuff about spirits?  But they came into contact with them constantly, hunting and gathering food.\n\nThey had absolutely no motivation to make up stuff that wasn't true.\n\nHopefully no one in this subreddit is a groupie.  A person who only wants to be impressed by what others claim.  And isn't actually interested in learning that.\n\nSuch a person is incapable of learning sorcery. It's a fluke of how sorcery works.

For hours.  Not once a year, or in some random weird situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent hours last night traveling between worlds, with my IOB friends.  Trying to learn about a 100,000 year old structure created likely by proto-humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like we all have actual paying jobs, in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And everywhere else the people are unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just pretending to have &amp;quot;job opportunities coming along any day now&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like your good for nothing uncle Bob.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re on to Bob, that deadbeat!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t interest anyone in here in a theoretical job that might or might not pay in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it sounds to me like your Russian guy is seriously unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in regards to what you gave us, I don&amp;#39;t see any explanation of why they can move objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen that more than 30 times.  Right in my face for most of those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also pounding on walls, knocking on doors, making coyote sounds right near your ear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re great poltergeists!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind they&amp;#39;re fully visible, you can hear them, they speak, and even do tricks or try to scare you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can also allow you to pass through solid walls!  Or leap to distant planets, land for real, fully awake, no drugs, eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you try to use what they taught you in a dangerous way, they&amp;#39;ll even stop  you.  Using force if needed.  They have independent goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They tried to kidnap our teacher, when it was clear he was dying. To take him to their world where he could survive his illness for a few million years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was there. It&amp;#39;s no made up story.  And I asked one of the entities that tried to kidnap him why she did that. She got annoyed and said they wanted to save him, not kidnap him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later she designed a &amp;quot;locator spell&amp;quot; people in here could use, to summon her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s called, &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;#39;s Pass&amp;quot; and is in the wiki  If you actually would like to meet one.  But you have to move your &amp;quot;assemblage&amp;quot; point down to the middle of the back, or it&amp;#39;s unlikely she&amp;#39;ll become visible to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ignore most of reality, as we were taught to do. These particular spirits visit children all the time, but the parents convince the kids they aren&amp;#39;t real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they can be passed on from one sorcerer to another, involuntarily.  For hundreds of years, since they live so long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can be used to scare the hell out of apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll run errands for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been sending one down a tunnel to a witch in south America, visibly seeing it go and return.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;#39;t do as I wished last night, and taunted me by going back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trust me when I say, it doesn&amp;#39;t obey my own commands. I have to find something it wants to do also, or it won&amp;#39;t help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It belongs to my witch friend, who has to &amp;quot;let it out&amp;quot; or I don&amp;#39;t get to see it at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos introduced me to his &amp;quot;Allies&amp;quot; around 1998, I forgot about them, and then they started showing up to scare the hell out of me, randomly. For the next 15 years before they finally &amp;quot;blackmailed&amp;quot; me to come here and help people learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to figure out they were the ones he had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the idea that it&amp;#39;s a product of myself, just doesn&amp;#39;t add up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little Smoke follows my witch friend Cholita around in daylight, and is fully visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s a little puff of intense white smoke, the size of a golf ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pushes paper aside in the art supply store after Cholita leaves it to look at something else, and is no longer interested.  It&amp;#39;s certainly not doing what she causes it to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They also come and go with new visitors constantly, and older ones not showing up for a long time,  as if they found something else to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have their own will, and that&amp;#39;s obvious once you start to interreact with them for hours a night.  Everyday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key is to stop &amp;quot;theorizing&amp;quot; and thinking about them, and actually have them around constantly.  So you can learn what they really are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you show us what type of interaction your expert had?   How often?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did he summon them?  How many did he have?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there anything written down in detail on how to get them yourself, and also who and how he taught others to do that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, why shouldn&amp;#39;t we &amp;quot;follow Jesus&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He could raise the dead!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t top that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d tell you they were demons and angels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be smarter to follow the Olmecs, who lived before money was invented, before any cities existed, and before there was agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they had no way to profit from making up stuff about spirits?  But they came into contact with them constantly, hunting and gathering food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had absolutely no motivation to make up stuff that wasn&amp;#39;t true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully no one in this subreddit is a groupie.  A person who only wants to be impressed by what others claim.  And isn&amp;#39;t actually interested in learning that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such a person is incapable of learning sorcery. It&amp;#39;s a fluke of how sorcery works.  You actually have to want to learn it, or you get nothing at all from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is the only purpose of this subreddit.

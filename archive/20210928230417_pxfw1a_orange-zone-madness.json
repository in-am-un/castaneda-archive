To see if this can be done in shamanic drumming circles, so that anyone who can get to the green zone, can visibly see the shared remote view.\n\nCan it?  I have no idea.\n\nBut if you think about it, the \"Men of Knowledge\" picked one thing after the other, and then learned to do it over and over.  By rituals.\n\nThe \"old seers\" did the same, but without the need for too many rituals.\n\nBoth wanted to do the \"same thing over and over\".\n\nThat's a very bad idea in the red zone, but in the orange zone it's ok!\n\nAnd I discovered, I could in fact succeed at remote viewing on the bedspread every single day.\n\nIt's just not in focus yet.\n\nWhile trying to focus a dirt road scene on the bed last night, a man handed me a paper with some tensegrity moves on it.\n\nAn actual paper was in my right hand.  I could see the man, who seemed a lot like me, coming from a hole in space and a conversation he'd been having with another person there.\n\nI focused on who was the other man, and I picked up a full dream context.\n\nJust like becoming lucid in a dream and suddenly knowing the \"history\" of that place, I could see that my double had been somewhere talking to someone. They'd put together a list of 10 tensegrity moves, drawn little pictures of possible desirable outcomes, and he handed it back to me in my physical body.\n\n\"Nonsense!\", I thought to myself.  And I dropped the paper to the side.  My hand was still touching it, but I wasn't going to hold that thing!  Maybe later I'd pick it up and see what it was all about.\n\nBut later on I got another \"flash\" of what the double was doing. Or had just been doing.\n\nIt was as if he wanted to \"catch up\" to me. And when he did I could remember what he knew.\n\nEventually I got into an argument with him, he warned me I'd never remember, and here I am now.\n\nI suppose it was him I argued with.  It happened, \"somewhere else\".\n\nAnd he was right&gt; Here I am, not remembering.  \n\nBut it seems, along with an extra arm to help your tensegrity moves, and along with switching over to the double so you can leap through the wall, the double also starts to hang out very close to you, reminiscent of those Olmec statues in the picture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false,

I don't know if he's made permanent friends with any demons, but he seems to be able to summon them when he wants.\n\nBut, here's what Buddhism is missing. Two key points of understanding.\n\nFirst, you can't learn to do any of this.\n\nEven Buddhists can't learn it.\n\nAll you can do is alter your copy of reality slightly, so more and more is allowed.\n\nBut if you don't have a specific destination in mind, you just sort of wander around, with no purpose.\n\nI like to say it's a \"false path\", but Techno thinks that's harsh, and \"dead end\" is more a more apt description.\n\nMeaning, you got to travel a while on a side street and it was cool, but there's nowhere to go from there.  \n\nWe're trying to drive all the way to the Space X launch pad in Texas, and go to Pluto.\n\nSo compare how far each scenario takes you.\n\nWe can do that, ONLY by hooking ourselves to \"The *Intent* of the Sorcerer's of Ancient Mexico\".\n\nBut until you visually see that,  doing what you are doing, it's hard to believe.\n\nWe're just allowing ourselves to be pulled by magnets. \n\nWe aren't actually moving our own selves.\n\nThat's the first point.  We're \"following an energetic thread\" back in time, to gain the help of those ancient seers.\n\nNone of whom are dead so far.  They pulled off the Buddhist thing of going to live in the heavens when it's time to die.\n\nSecond point is the assemblage point.  No one but sorcerers know about it.\n\nSo we're a little like Mr. Spock from Star Trek, with his tricorder, telling us exactly where we are located on the weird alien planet.  \n\nWe have a tool that no other system has.\n\nIf you haven't done so, scan through the little pictures along the railroad tracks on the J curve image so you can look at your own scenery while you practice, and get an idea where you are, on the J curve.  \n\nI guarantee you, you are somewhere between that green line, and the red line.\n\nIf you were below the red line, your comment would be more like, \"Holy Shit!!!!  You guys didn't warn me that...\"\n\n(evil spirits will  threaten to bite your head off, bizarre animals will try to teach you how to shapeshift, a demon in a miniskirt will offer to teach you something important...)\n\nYou'd be off in \"Agni\" territory if you could make it to the bottom, planning what you'll do first when you disincarnate.\n\nBut you have to pass through there, to get to where we want to go.\n\nThe orange zone.\n\nThat's \"basic\" enlightenment territory.\n\nAnd yet, we want want to go further, into the purple zone.\n\nNo one in here can get there yet, for more than a few minutes.\n\nOver there the assemblage point becomes fully visible.

Two key points of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, you can&amp;#39;t learn to do any of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Buddhists can&amp;#39;t learn it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All you can do is alter your copy of reality slightly, so more and more is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you don&amp;#39;t have a specific destination in mind, you just sort of wander around, with no purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to say it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;false path&amp;quot;, but Techno thinks that&amp;#39;s harsh, and &amp;quot;dead end&amp;quot; is more a more apt description.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, you got to travel a while on a side street and it was cool, but there&amp;#39;s nowhere to go from there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re trying to drive all the way to the Space X launch pad in Texas, and go to Pluto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So compare how far each scenario takes you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can do that, ONLY by hooking ourselves to &amp;quot;The &lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; of the Sorcerer&amp;#39;s of Ancient Mexico&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But until you visually see that,  doing what you are doing, it&amp;#39;s hard to believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re just allowing ourselves to be pulled by magnets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t actually moving our own selves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the first point.  We&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;following an energetic thread&amp;quot; back in time, to gain the help of those ancient seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of whom are dead so far.  They pulled off the Buddhist thing of going to live in the heavens when it&amp;#39;s time to die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second point is the assemblage point.  No one but sorcerers know about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;re a little like Mr. Spock from Star Trek, with his tricorder, telling us exactly where we are located on the weird alien planet.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have a tool that no other system has.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t done so, scan through the little pictures along the railroad tracks on the J curve image so you can look at your own scenery while you practice, and get an idea where you are, on the J curve.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guarantee you, you are somewhere between that green line, and the red line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you were below the red line, your comment would be more like, &amp;quot;Holy Shit!!!!  You guys didn&amp;#39;t warn me that...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(evil spirits will  threaten to bite your head off, bizarre animals will try to teach you how to shapeshift, a demon in a miniskirt will offer to teach you something important...)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d be off in &amp;quot;Agni&amp;quot; territory if you could make it to the bottom, planning what you&amp;#39;ll do first when you disincarnate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to pass through there, to get to where we want to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;basic&amp;quot; enlightenment territory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, we want want to go further, into the purple zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one in here can get there yet, for more than a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over there the assemblage point becomes fully visible.    You could glance at someone, and instantly know what view of the world they are using.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all that, the goal is to go to all of those locations on the J curve, at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_pxfw1a", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pxfw1a/orange_zone_madness/hf427mz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1633191380.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hfi0fdq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "thegrumpypanda101", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1633453510.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hf389yn", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5qajpdsw", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Can you explain more about kasina meditation.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hfi0fdq", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you explain more about kasina meditation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_pxfw1a", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pxfw1a/orange_zone_madness/hfi0fdq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1633453510.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hf389yn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "galyali61", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1633176880.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_pxfw1a", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_bzvxbuwv", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "hello  \nI have been practicing kasina meditation for 45 days.

The one of Little Smoke&amp;#39;s beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose that means little smoke yanked me billions of light years away, in an instant. That&amp;#39;s where she lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stood up to look at the first painting on the wall inside that tunnel, and a voice explained that Nagual came on a huge ship to Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked down the tunnel as far as I could, and there were pictures all the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I gazed into one, the emissary started explaining who that was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, I could actually stick my head in each painting, and it began to animate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT&amp;#39;S waking dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why misrepresent ordinary dreams, when you can have real magic?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s WAY better than sleeping dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to get too excited in the tunnel, and found myself back on the steps of On 8, in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An orange cat I had been watching, had leaped to the top of the apartment complex across the small road, and was tight rope walking on a pipe connecting the buildings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening I got smashed on whiskey, and stumbled into a herd of 500 rats in the darkness, so that an observer would report it to an office manager from Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was the one who had the power to hand the double woman, Jenna, over to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After hearing I&amp;#39;d almost been eaten alive by rats, due to my excesses, he asked my translator if there was anyone who could control me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;quot;yea, only one though.  Jenna.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You really don&amp;#39;t need to &amp;quot;pretend&amp;quot; your sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets very weird very soon, if you just put some work into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_rg8ig0", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rg8ig0/deleted_by_user/hojnmlq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1639508678.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1639508678.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hoj8f9z", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1639502732.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hoj6do1", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rg8ig0/deleted_by_user/hoj8f9z/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_hoj8f9z", "created": 1639502732.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hoj6do1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1639501947.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hois941", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Yea, this poor guy was an \"experiment\".\n\nI was a bit harsh on him.

Asian meditation systems admit that if you can shut off your internal dialogue, you are \"enlightened\".\n\nIt's just that they never actually did.\n\nSo they remain totally lame.\n\nAnd when they find out some can, and see far better magic than anyone in their system ever had, they change their tune and claim that's not enough.\n\nBut at least, you know you'll be \"Enlightened\" if you succeed.\n\nFor what that's worth.\n\nI doubt it can even buy a cup of Starbucks.

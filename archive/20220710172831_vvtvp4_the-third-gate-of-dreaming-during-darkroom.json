It's impossible to reach the 3rd gate without perfect silence!\n\nCarlos even said so at Bodhi Tree bookstore during a lecture, when some angry man tried to pretend to be a comrade, by asking him a \"third gate\" question.\n\nCarlos didn't even let him finish.  If anyone has the quote, feel free. But I'll paraphrase it.\n\nHe said, it's impossible to reach the 3rd gate until you can achieve deep internal silence. Come back in a year after you learn that, and we'll \"talk shop\".\n\nLet me add, it's impossible to hear the dreaming emissary teaching you in the inorganic beings' realm, which must happen at the second gate, until you can get silent.\n\nit kind of means, everyone  just ignored the instructions.\n\nWhich let me point out again, DO NOT APPLY to women.\n\nThen can play around with 4 gates  if they like.  And make it work too.\n\nBecause women can \"cheat\".\n\nAnd we're nothing else if not, \"The New Cheaters\".\n\n\"The New Seers\" were a little stuffy for my taste anyway.\n\nAnd we have no Nagual to give us the Nagual's blow.\n\nSo we \"snuck in the back door\" of the theater.\n\nWe still get to watch the movie.  And all the others in the megaplex too!\n\nBut how does this, \"Waking Four Gates of Dreaming\" work?\n\nLet's compare the steps.  Here's sleeping dreaming:\n\n1   Find your hands\n\n2  Visit the inorganic beings realm and learn from the dreaming emissary, to get her dark energy\n\n3  Learn to sustain dreams longer with \"dreams inside dreams\".\n\n4  Wake up in the real world.\n\nSeems kind of obvious, doesn't it?\n\nLet's redo those steps using darkroom.\n\n1 Find puffs.  Those are what makes the dreamer's hands.  So if you find a puff, you found your dreaming body's hands.  Or his foot.  Or his di...   I guess you did even better than if you were asleep, since don Juan originally told Carlos to find something instead of his hands.\n\nWe have both covered!   At the first gate, we kick butt over sleeping dreaming.\n\n2 Visit the inorganic beings' realm.  That's pretty much just the deep red zone.  If someone gets way down there and doesn't have an Ally, we can figure out why then.  But I doubt that can happen.  And if you get into the red zone with your Ally, you won't be able to stop it from teaching!  It'll even \"overteach\" you.\n\n3 Dreams inside dreams is exactly what happens when you \"translocate\".  Or even when you \"find a dream inside a puff\".\n\nNot as satisfying?  That's because you cheated. That \"dream\" inside a puff, is really you looking at a dream your double is having.  The puff is your energy body.  So you got a \"preview\" of Silent Knowledge.  That little dream.  Or any \"crystalline details\" on the edges of the puff.\n\nThat's what the Men of Knowledge were able to do.  \"Speed up\" \"previews\" using drugs and allies.\n\nThey could never reach silent knowledge on their own, since silent knowledge is in fact \"seeing\".\n\nThe Men of Knowledge were NOT seers.\n\nJust profitters.\n\nBut cool profiteers.\n\nSo, the dreams inside dreams will become \"absorbing\" when you finally move your assemblage point into Silent Knowledge.\n\nIn fact, they get damned confusing!\n\nThat's what's over in the advanced subreddit. Me trying to understand what went wrong, when in fact I was simply visiting \"the third gate\" during darkroom.\n\nThe final step of darkroom \"Four Gates Dreaming\" is automatic.\n\n4  Bring out the double into the real copy of your bedroom?\n\nNo need.

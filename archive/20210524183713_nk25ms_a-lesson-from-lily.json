That means you can have more than 1.](https://preview.redd.it/uf7vc6rj8i171.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=745178a74fde392ac74f5545ab16793cd4391acf)\n\nOk, first...  the caveat.  The disclaimer.\n\nIOBs don't come with nametags.  So if you have more than 1 around,  you're out of luck for being sure who you're talking to.  Not only that, but they seem to take pleasure in keeping you in the dark at times.\n\nI suppose if you were don Juan, you could switch to a 1970s Hong Kong Kung Fu movie dubbed English voice and say, \"You fool!!!  Do you not realize that all have their own ***shine?***  And you must use all of your training so that you instantly know which **hue** your opponent is using in his attack!\"\n\nI suppose that doesn't sound funny to younger people.   But I often get to hear what the weird martial artists in those old 70s Chinese movies are saying, and why.\n\nIt often makes sense, if you understand their culture. But translated to English, with no understanding of Chinese society, it seems overly dramatic for no reason.\n\nLike, \"The Warriors Way\".\n\nKind of cheesy.\n\nBut the audience eats it up!\n\nAnd I know for a fact that Carlos enjoyed those classics.  He even used one as a parting gift to me, when it was clear he would die soon.\n\nHe called me to his compound, alone, and gave me half a pear, covered in Mexican Crema.\n\nI ate it, and he told me to leave.\n\nI didn't find out for 22 years that it was a Kung Fu movie reference.  You have to read Kanji to understand it, and so it took a Chinese man to explain why he did that.\n\nLast night my darkroom was very active, because I'd spent the afternoon soaking up \"sunshine glitter\", off my cell phone screen.\n\nI wasn't sure it would help, but I've been running out of energy lately, after an intense 15 minutes. It still takes me hours to get my assemblage point to move far enough for spectacular results, but once I'm surrounded by amazing things, using my dreaming attention at full strength,  I have only 15 minutes before I notice a \"caffeine  headache\", feel sleepy, and want to lay down.\n\nI can frantically renew by doing a little Tensegrity, but only once.\n\nI tried to cheat last night. I was in bed, it was time to get up to practice, but I was in pain.\n\nI'm not a spring chicken anymore.\n\nI glanced up, and saw that space above my closed eyes had turned entirely to the second attention.\n\nIt was a series of yellow \"shelves\" stretching above me.\n\nI didn't want to get up, so I reached  up to the top shelf, and scooped the objects there, forcing them down to the next shelf.  My belief was that when the second attention objects were on the bottom shelf, in front of my eyes, my assemblage point would be moved past pain and it would be easy to get up.\n\nIt didn't work as well as I liked, but then Cholita decided to help. I could hear her sneaking around on the wooden floor.\n\nI'm not sure what worries me more.  Cholita slamming doors, or Cholita sneaking around in the darkness.\n\nShe made it to the bathroom, and I realized she was planning to go out and didn't want me aware of it.\n\nI got up, walked over to be closer to the bathroom, which was behind 2 walls, and discovered it was fairly easy to see through the walls tonight.\n\nI watched  Cholita a while,  even having the realization that you could see anyone you like with that technique.\n\nIt wasn't necessarily limited to Cholita.\n\nI kept trying to figure out what exactly she was wearing, until she slammed the front door and drove off.\n\nI turned back to the center of the dark room, and there was Lily.  She was floating just below my chest, no more than 2 feet away.  It was the same look I'd seen the first time I found her.\n\n\"Lily!  How nice.  What brings you out?  I sure didn't expect that.\"\n\nShe replied, \"you drew me.\"\n\nI was puzzled.  I even felt a little guilty.  As if I'd betrayed her.\n\nIOBs don't actually have a voice, so if they say something bizarre like that the illusion that they spoke goes out the window with doubt.\n\nI was thinking, what a strange thing to say!  Was it an accusation?\n\nI turned around to face the door again, to fix a leak of light coming from under it. I have a towel pressed up against there.\n\nAbove me to the left, was \"the whorl\".  A  Yin Yang symbol made entire of light and dark, rotating in space. Around 4 inches in diameter.  It wasn't vague at all.  It was brilliant.\n\nI haven't seen that for a long time.  I've concluded, there are much better ways to read text from intent, and even Carlos didn't really use that Whorl much.  My suspicion had been that a woman had seen it, the same who drew the painting of reading off the wall, so Carlos wrote it up in his last books as if everyone would see that.  As if he were trying to cash in on  her *intent*.\n\nIn fact, if you want to get messages from intent, it's much easier to get them from a stable dream floating in the air.\n\nLily responded.\n\n\"It's always here.  You just focus your attention in the wrong place.\"\n\n\"Don't you know it's all the same?  Your awareness is only there to watch what intent discovers about itself.  About what forms it can take.\"\n\n\"To keep you happy, or rather, to use you as a probe, it obeys your wishes.  You can make suggestions to intent, using your recognition.\"\n\n\"But you spend all of your time going inward, to create the hellish nightmare worlds you live in.  When all you have to do is, look outward!\"\n\nI turned back to face the center of the room, to see what \"look outward\" meant.\n\nI don't like to face the wall where Cholita can be seen, and do anything but try to see through it.  I have the wall trained, and don't want to confuse it.  When Cholita first arrived, it was a dreaming window for viewing where she was wandering.  Since then Fancy changed it over for me by teaching about her pink energy telescope balls.\n\nWhich by the way, work better than not compressing a big ball of pink light.  They're just too heavy to  hold up for very long.\n\nGlancing back into the middle of the room, I saw Lily flying about me.  She was on fire with absolutely brilliant flames.  I almost got the color right in that picture, except that the flames responded to my *intent*.  When I thought of them as flames, they turned red and orange.  When I examined Lily's face, wondering if there was any way to be sure it was her, they turned violet.\n\n\"You drew me!\", she said.  \"Don't you recognize your own drawings?\"\n\nThen she proceeded to give me the lesson you see above, except that most of it is beyond my ability to draw.\n\nIf Lily returns tonight I'm going to ask, \"So where's the Lily pad? I drew that too!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A Lesson from Lily", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/3d25cf64-9180-40a4-9c8e-5eb1570a7672", "link_ids": ["t3_jkedo9", "t3_ixrw34", "t3_iubqq2", "t3_kea5zt", "t3_lwckni", "t3_lwcg6o", "t3_lqz7b6", "t3_lqr6zf", "t3_lnt8a6", "t3_lmp574", "t3_lm4zws", "t3_ll9z5w", "t3_lelqm7", "t3_leo7sy", "t3_ld3845", "t3_lc1ls0", "t3_lbsls8", "t3_l7cp8f", "t3_l6o7at", "t3_mz3kz7", "t3_mzx9gl", "t3_m0kyjq", "t3_lwwshw", "t3_m1oqf1", "t3_mx3d2u", "t3_mw8sve", "t3_mtfwhb", "t3_m2u0a0", "t3_mrkitp", "t3_mlhy6f", "t3_mauwly", "t3_cm1zxx", "t3_m30hb1", "t3_n17jdy", "t3_n1ljja", "t3_n7pwp8", "t3_n7zeae", "t3_naznr8", "t3_nc8q8m", "t3_ndsc7q", "t3_neslbo", "t3_nfw7xg", "t3_nir9g2", "t3_nk25ms", "t3_nkyszq", "t3_nogrjo", "t3_ns7tky", "t3_nvehdz", "t3_o0ifzx", "t3_o3inhw", "t3_o53rhe", "t3_o7qp2a", "t3_ogafdn", "t3_org1tv", "t3_owrd1h", "t3_ovqmgq", "t3_oyt4zt", "t3_oxczfa", "t3_ogzoth", "t3_pcyx4h", "t3_p9anre", "t3_p8asd8", "t3_p6ga7i", "t3_p5l6ye", "t3_p0fmbc", "t3_ozfrz4", "t3_pij28q", "t3_posqcc", "t3_pu14ic", "t3_pwrrc0", "t3_pxfw1a", "t3_q1fcee", "t3_q4x5cs", "t3_q57hxg", "t3_q7jpwq", "t3_q7snvr", "t3_q9epxq", "t3_qceavx", "t3_qctyq7", "t3_qdp6bb", "t3_q9idzp", "t3_qklney", "t3_qmbwgp", "t3_qn9y63", "t3_qo8gj1", "t3_qpoc9e", "t3_qr6cta", "t3_qqyzj8", "t3_rwu1f0", "t3_rw73iz", "t3_rb5o0q", "t3_sdgq2p", "t3_sf44pk", "t3_te7jnl", "t3_tu3w80", "t3_tzc628"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 2", "created_at_utc": 1611109587.162, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "3d25cf64-9180-40a4-9c8e-5eb1570a7672", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1676831407.209, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"uf7vc6rj8i171": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uf7vc6rj8i171.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1be8cdfc5224f04065475c6418e173352929c74f"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uf7vc6rj8i171.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ed0e77abf214a14b1c33cd20cfe4d86ee6da1ab"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uf7vc6rj8i171.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbf3c6d3799c57131fc3c9306c6e4426f988a7d3"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uf7vc6rj8i171.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d96c870ef871980a77459912986270fe3fa72d48"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uf7vc6rj8i171.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97864b2bbfcff2188e629134c2b8499b5e75def0"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uf7vc6rj8i171.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f69a95c48972adb45ea3eca40fef7aa75979187f"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uf7vc6rj8i171.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=745178a74fde392ac74f5545ab16793cd4391acf"}, "id": "uf7vc6rj8i171"}}, "name": "t3_nk25ms", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/IckadyYY-zIIZFR2mmc6cIIhLozZZ-mfO0vgAaZBAug.jpg", "edited": 1622052260.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1621874233.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uf7vc6rj8i171.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=745178a74fde392ac74f5545ab16793cd4391acf\"&gt;Lily takes on the role of dreaming emissary!

I&amp;#39;d read about Elias traveling all over the universe without his body, and Lily must have noticed me thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was doing it last night, over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence -&amp;gt; no fantasies -&amp;gt; forget who you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You actually have to forget who you are to get it to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the sunlight glitter helps make sure you don&amp;#39;t fall asleep doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;True, it brightens up inorganic being manifestations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it also puts a &amp;quot;liveliness&amp;quot; into the second attention, so that it&amp;#39;s not so dull and vague you can&amp;#39;t focus your attention on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without the attention focused on something, if you forget who you are, you fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A grotesque oversimplification, but it&amp;#39;ll feel true at some point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some sorcery things are like that famous Zen saying:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I eat when hungry, sleep when tired.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, that saying is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For about 2 weeks. Then it&amp;#39;s stupid. The guy deserved to be punched in the nose, if he kept repeating that to students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Odd that the Zen masters never point out, that saying is only true when you just got there and aren&amp;#39;t used to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re obsessed with lying and saying enlightenment is permanent, because the Buddhism hierarchy wanted to fit in, in Asia.  A seniority based culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But their monks learn it&amp;#39;s not true from the horrible behavior of Zen masters as they get older, are replaced, and don&amp;#39;t have to put on airs anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_nk25ms", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/nk25ms/a_lesson_from_lily/gzedn2w/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1621955281.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1621955281.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gzcpysh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Own_Oil7766", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gzbqc4u", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_8akovn3u", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "From the text on the link you provided, I understood that you practice this technique with the phone screen for no more than 1 ... 2 minutes?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gzcpysh", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the text on the link you provided, I understood that you practice this technique with the phone screen for no more than 1 ... 2 minutes?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_nk25ms", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/nk25ms/a_lesson_from_lily/gzcpysh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1621914149.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1621914149.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gzbqc4u", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1621895326.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gzb32i1", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Here's the cellphone post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/g6rp3g/cellphone\\_energy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/g6rp3g/cellphone_energy/)\n\nAnd you don't wiggle the eyes.

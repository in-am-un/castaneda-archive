So I'll just put a picture to show what's up, and add the link after that.\n\nSomewhere in late 1995 after what seemed to be endless attacks by fake sorcerers with their \"TOLTEC!!!\" books, people claiming to be lovers of Carlos, some claiming he raped them up the butt while they were sleep paralyzed and assorted other things I'd rather forget, Carlos stood before us to start a lecture in private classes and said, as if it were part of a conversation he was having on the way up the stairs to Dance Home:\n\n\"And NOW there's this guy in Colorado who claims he's me!  ME!!!\"\n\nHe just shook his head in disbelief.\n\nI honestly can't account for the craziness surrounding Carlos.  Those books just drove people mad. Everyone wanted to cash in, and pretend to be \"magic men\".\n\nBut Colorado Carlos rose even above Tata Kachora (who claims to be don Juan), or Ken Eagle Feather who claims to be the \"replacement apprentice\" of don Juan.\n\nAnd don't think there aren't 10 \"La Gordas\" out there too!\n\nI've heard tales of the teaching methods of Colorado Carlos and as I can best figure out, he trivialized everything until \"stopping the world\" just meant take a coffee break.\n\nOne sad man told me about taking drugs with Colorado Carlos, and how it was all about \"love\".\n\nSounded more to me like some sexual abuse was inevitable there.\n\nIt's common with \"Benefactor\" types.  Sad men who pretend to be sorcerers a bit too often for their own good, and then some gullible idiot decides to become their apprentice.\n\nThe lure of being able to say, \"I have a benefactor\" even took a private class woman, who  joined up with the despicable Kachora.\n\nWell you can join, but you won't go anywhere. She should have stuck with the remnants of private classes, who have just about all of the magic working now.\n\nOften someone who falls for a crazy man claiming he can teach sorcery, ends up drugged on shrooms with the old \"benefactor up the butt\".\n\nIt's possibly MOSTLY sexually predatory to be a \"benefactor\".\n\nAnd totally clueless.  Those were the \"Men of Knowledge\".\n\nWe DO NOT want to be \"Men of Knowledge\".\n\nThey never learned to SEE!\n\nThat's clear throughout the books, although don Juan later commented  that as some of the Men of Knowledge finally learned to see, it spelled the end of them.\n\nThey become so engrossed with the bizarre worlds they could see, that they ceased to be Men of Knowledge.  And couldn't fit off invading neighboring Indian tribes.\n\nWhich kind of means, the Men of Knowledge were like Ripoches.\n\nWanting to \"do good\" for the community, despite being absolutely clueless about the nature of reality.\n\nBoth the Men of Knowledge and the Rinpoches have integrated into society at several levels. \n\nThe Men of Knowledge in fact had to get a license from the Olmec government.  The very first Government in the Americas, and possibly one of the first large cities on earth.\n\nI suppose the Rinpoches need a license from the high mountains of Tibet? The government in exile from the communist Chinese?\n\nThose Men of Knowledge were bakers, mask makers, dancers, and healers.\n\nWe heard about the healer types and their use of power plants, rituals and an Ally, to help random people get a taste of \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nIn exchange for goods and services.\n\nLike the Rinpoches, the Men of knowledge were merchants looking for profit.\n\nBut they did manage to produce some astonishing magic, unlike the Rinpoches.\n\nThey led people to what we seek. Silent Knowledge.\n\n\"Seeing\".  \n\nBut we learn that without the drugs.\n\nSo I suppose the men of knowledge were somewhat the \"good guys\" in Olmec society, but they were NOT seers.\n\nAnd I'm not sure who was eating who with their sharp little flint knives way back then, but suspect it was the old seers doing away with trouble making \"Men of Knowledge\" like Douglas here.\n\nPests to the true magical community.\n\nOr like Colorado Carlos.\n\nMaybe it's just my fantasy, but the attacks on Carlos are so bad you kind of wish for those cannibal seers to come give them a lesson in fright, the way they did for La Gorda who found one of their power objects (a stone with a hole in the middle), held it too long and summoned the intent of the old seers creeping up to eat her alive.\n\nHey... I'd welcome that!\n\nMagic is fun.  We don't have don Juan around to give us such shows.\n\nBut La Gorda was spoiled and didn't appreciate a cool experience, so don Juan had to bury her in a dirt coffin for a week or two to move her assemblage point off those emanations still glowing with the awareness from 8000 years, when the old seers were at full strength.\n\nAs we know from our own \"death defier\" sorcerer, who was 8000 at last count.\n\nThere's not much more to say about Douglas here, except the guy with the bad hair piece who also \"teaches\" sorcery on youtube, a student of his,  claimed he was dead.\n\nIt's not much worth looking into I suppose.\n\nOne of these delusional men attacked the subreddit a couple of years ago, insisting our Carlos, who is the fake, must be blackmailing us or we wouldn't deny Colorado Carlos is the real copy.\n\nHe also explained that \"the death defier\" taught Carlos Castaneda how to split himself into 90 copies, and the one we had in Los Angeles was one of the \"lesser\" of those.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Relentless Attacks On Carlos Never End!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 68, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"29ln7m6sr9sa1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 53, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/29ln7m6sr9sa1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd90165fe6d0bea05c7331eb2a62724d6763de41"}, {"y": 106, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/29ln7m6sr9sa1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c024620394212a6d8f80ead4d056e2d2c26cf55"}, {"y": 157, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/29ln7m6sr9sa1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa26b9aad7cdb2d3f43a2685282db79d27d4170d"}, {"y": 314, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/29ln7m6sr9sa1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f11f7ce9ec2752d396380e9b3e44f4e8b808e37b"}, {"y": 471, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/29ln7m6sr9sa1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65d1ff4b14c8823ebf3eb507385b2f7830b3a8e6"}, {"y": 530, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/29ln7m6sr9sa1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b24ed90abe498093273a01e1d67e6cb56013227c"}], "s": {"y": 1006, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/29ln7m6sr9sa1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b628b3d70d15aba2241f7125fe8276aa56371eb"}, "id": "29ln7m6sr9sa1"}}, "name": "t3_12dl3mq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/K2JpTnG21ad0MifjjcRcxIx_NIhk68GPQ5AboOB_6xI.jpg", "edited": 1680789949.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1680789266.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/29ln7m6sr9sa1.png?width=2048&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3b628b3d70d15aba2241f7125fe8276aa56371eb\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/29ln7m6sr9sa1.png?width=2048&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3b628b3d70d15aba2241f7125fe8276aa56371eb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*** From Facebook ***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably this guy will take his feed down after I post this.

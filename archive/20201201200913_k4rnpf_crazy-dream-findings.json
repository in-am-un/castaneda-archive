You can fool yourself.\n\nContinuing to look (prove lucidity) is like finding your hands, and looking from object to object.\n\nThat's what brings the scout in the first place!\n\nSo if you have that kind of lucidity, don't waste it.  We need their dark energy to go further. That's why this happens at the second gate.\n\nYou won't get into any \"energetic\" dream worlds before you find a scout and get some of their energy.  I'm not convinced you have to visit their world, but if you insist, try getting them to chase you.\n\nLearn to zoom from mountain top to mountain top, until it decides to ride on your back.\n\nThen you'll land in their world eventually.\n\nFor their world, don't expect a cave, hive, or whatever picture you got from the books.\n\nExpect Hieronymus Bosch or Salvador Dali .

It does indeed turn into a light.  But whatever you are expecting is probably not right, so don't be picky.  I don't want to influence you.\n\nSo I'll make a weird story.  Let's say, you point your finger at it, it moves towards you, you shout at it to stop, and intensify your gaze on it's shirt.  On the chest.\n\nIt does in fact stop, and starts to sway and wiggle.  And then the shirt dissolves, and you see an old fashioned 60W light bulb.  Stuck in it's chest.\n\nJust accept that.  Good enough.  It doesn't have to be a triangular candle shape floating in space all alone.\n\nAnd besides, you want to make it fully transform, if you know for sure it's a scout.  Let it go back to it's previous form.\n\n(Though you will see that floating light in space thing later if you keep going.)\n\nAlso,  probably when you first find one, it'll test you by coming towards you.\n\nYou can stare at them, but it doesn't stop them right away.\n\nIf you can be fierce enough with the finger pointing (I'd switch to a stronger finger), and an **intense** gaze at the details on him or her, you can keep them from coming closer.\n\nIf they won't stop, you have to wrestle them.  Or \"push back\", is more like it.\n\nIf you have the thought, \"This is impossible!  His force is infinite!!! He's going to bend me in half by pushing me.\"\n\nYou're doing good.  Just don't give up anyway. Once it realizes you aren't afraid anymore, it stops to find what game to play next.\n\nAt that point, point your finger at it, stare, and insist, \"Change into a ????\"\n\nWhatever you like.  They'll stay that way for at least a few dreams before the intent is messed up.\n\nI also suggest, when you are face to face with a scout who isn't a dreaming phantom, you'll be able to \"feel it\".\n\nThey're \"silently creepy\".\n\nLike, that weird uncle Adolph who can wiggle his ears, because he used to be a circus clown.

Let it go back to it&amp;#39;s previous form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Though you will see that floating light in space thing later if you keep going.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also,  probably when you first find one, it&amp;#39;ll test you by coming towards you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can stare at them, but it doesn&amp;#39;t stop them right away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can be fierce enough with the finger pointing (I&amp;#39;d switch to a stronger finger), and an &lt;strong&gt;intense&lt;/strong&gt; gaze at the details on him or her, you can keep them from coming closer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they won&amp;#39;t stop, you have to wrestle them.  Or &amp;quot;push back&amp;quot;, is more like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have the thought, &amp;quot;This is impossible!  His force is infinite!!! He&amp;#39;s going to bend me in half by pushing me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re doing good.  Just don&amp;#39;t give up anyway. Once it realizes you aren&amp;#39;t afraid anymore, it stops to find what game to play next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, point your finger at it, stare, and insist, &amp;quot;Change into a ????&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you like.  They&amp;#39;ll stay that way for at least a few dreams before the intent is messed up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also suggest, when you are face to face with a scout who isn&amp;#39;t a dreaming phantom, you&amp;#39;ll be able to &amp;quot;feel it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;silently creepy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, that weird uncle Adolph who can wiggle his ears, because he used to be a circus clown.  But now he has Parkinson&amp;#39;s and doesn&amp;#39;t do much talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But from your own childhood past.

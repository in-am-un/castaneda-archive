If you're talking mindfulness, that's Zen.  \n\nZen works, but it's a horribly slow path.

It's too confused. And there's too much hazing, to make you into a bitter guy who won't talk to others about what you do.\n\nExcept western Zen. Some of that is really clear.\n\nUnfortunately, nearly everyone doing Zen will tell you to ignore the little man standing on your hand. Even the westernized Zen masters.\n\nHere's Zen master Shinzen Young ignoring magic and saying it's for philosophers to worry about.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1714&amp;v=xF5V9r7_ZHI&amp;t=25m40s\n\nJesus Christ! \n\nDon't ignore the little man standing on your hand!!!!!!\n\nThat's what we need in life.  Magic regulates your body, naturally producing more happiness chemicals.\n\nNo magic = dead end life.  Decay into sadness, self-pity, and disappointment.\n\nLook around!

They have no real appearance.  We add that ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check out the Buddhist writings posted today, where a master encounters 4 beautiful women who offer to appear any way he wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On their own, they&amp;#39;re just a collection of little lights no one would notice. Or in the case of Carlos&amp;#39; allies, a bar of light, quite substantial and bright.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So if I create the energy your talking about and...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll work if you put in the time. If you&amp;#39;re talking mindfulness, that&amp;#39;s Zen.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zen works, but it&amp;#39;s a horribly slow path.  They like to collect as many donations and free workers as they can, so they don&amp;#39;t tell you the direct path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they did, they&amp;#39;d be out of business in a year, and no one would have passed on &amp;quot;Zen&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have to slow you down, just to exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I confronted Joshu Sasaki, a famous LA Zen master, with that issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He couldn&amp;#39;t answer it other than to imply his beautiful ceremonies were worth seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with Zen, you probably won&amp;#39;t even make it.  It&amp;#39;s too confused. And there&amp;#39;s too much hazing, to make you into a bitter guy who won&amp;#39;t talk to others about what you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except western Zen. Some of that is really clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, nearly everyone doing Zen will tell you to ignore the little man standing on your hand. Even the westernized Zen masters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s Zen master Shinzen Young ignoring magic and saying it&amp;#39;s for philosophers to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1714&amp;amp;v=xF5V9r7_ZHI&amp;amp;t=25m40s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1714&amp;amp;v=xF5V9r7_ZHI&amp;amp;t=25m40s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t ignore the little man standing on your hand!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what we need in life.

It's hard to fuss in your mind over Aunt Ethel's stupid bullying the last time you saw her, when you're watching magic float in the air!\n\nIf you watch ANYTHING coming from the second attention, in silence, your assemblage point will drift towards heightened awareness.\n\nAs it drifts, energy is released, and the hypnogogic images will be taken over by any available inorganic being.

Look all around the room, until you find out where it's materialized.  If it doesn't, do mashing energy until you can see a flurry of activity there, and try again.\n\nYou're no longer scooping clouds of light. You're scooping dreaming scenes onto your body.\n\nResult?\n\nI have no idea.

Or I hear very high frequency sounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night, one of the inorganic beings I&amp;#39;m trying to tame even whistled for me.  Just once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be afraid of those beings!   They make wonderful friends, if you can overcome your fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless of course, those really were aliens.  But in that case, wouldn&amp;#39;t it be kind of cool to be abducted?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never understand why people are afraid of the supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to remember this:  When you perceive something that should not be there, it releases energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This can be felt as goosebumps, becoming light headed, or more commonly, fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not fear. It&amp;#39;s energy.  But fear can move the assemblage point, and release the same kind of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we associate this energy with fear, when in fact there&amp;#39;s no such association.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That energy is like a magnet for inorganic beings, who like to move in close, to get the warmth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you were frightened, they play that up to get more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you greet them as if they were very good friends,  they react that way instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_enar69", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/enar69/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this/fea2sey/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1578943781.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1578943781.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fe96pop", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fdy3biq", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/enar69/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this/fe96pop/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_fe96pop", "created": 1578934874.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1578934874.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fdy3biq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1578775614.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_enar69", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Sounds like a classic inorganic being encounter.\n\nI've seen them manifest as many as 5 copies of themselves, in various shapes.\n\nThe weird effects are the assemblage point moving, and the second attention coming out to fill in missing details.\n\nThe only thing that's odd here is what triggered it, when you hadn't been practicing sorcery.\n\nBut inorganic beings play with everyone, all the time.

There's no way to know what's up there.\n\nMost will not tell you honestly what they are doing.\n\nSome tell you too much.\n\nEventually I suppose, we'll have some who have succeeded.  Even when it was very difficult for them.\n\nAnd we'll know why it didn't work at first.\n\nMy guess: They're misunderstanding what the internal dialogue is.\n\nBut according to Taisha and Florinda, Carlos was like that.\n\nSo he was given power plants.\n\nPersonally, I find that a little misleading.  Carlos asked to be given power plants.  He wanted to write a PhD thesis on how the native Americans used them.\n\nAnd meanwhile, don Juan slapped him on the back, and pushed his assemblage point where we try to move our own.\n\nSo it's not like he was not learning!\n\nI say, forget the power plants.  You'll just get all twisted out of shape.\n\nBut that's your choice.\n\nWhile trying to \"master\" remote viewing, I discovered it's really just \"reading off the wall\".\n\nIf you're a beginner, that won't make a lot of sense.  So you need to do some studying.  Read.  Look at the old posts in here!\n\nYou have a REAL GRIMOIRE in this subreddit.\n\nOne of those, \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" old books on magic.  With real spells that work.\n\nThose mostly don't exist!  I spent decades looking at old books on magic.\n\nAll fake.  Made for money, the same as the sorcery books made to pretend they can teach you Castaneda's sorcery.\n\nIn all the old \"grimoires\", I only found 3 or 4 \"real\" ones.\n\nBut in here, you have dozens!\n\nSo read!!!\n\nDon't post!\n\nRead!!!\n\nBut if you need to post, go ahead.  Just try to focus your posts on learning magic, and helping others learn magic.\n\nWhat you see here came about because of my desire to master remote viewing. I didn't realize that was nothing more than \"seeing\".\n\nSo while trying hard to make a good view, of the mountains of Mexico, I found it to be very difficult.\n\nI could not focus!  I tried harder and harder.\n\nAnd then, a voice told me, \"Do this!\".\n\nOr, \"that's not right, here's a picture to show you.\"\n\nSoon I was surrounded by \"advice\".\n\nI couldn't make it stop!\n\nI did not understand, I was getting what I wanted.\n\n*Seeing* **is** remote viewing!\n\nBut to make it remote viewing, you must be free from worries. Otherwise, you will \"remote view the answer to your worry\".\n\nEvery new advice was so amazing, I wanted to write it on paper.\n\nIt became a problem. I wanted to practice longer. But I was afraid I would lose valuable information.\n\nSo each day I stopped practicing, to write it down.\n\nFortunately, each day it was a little better.  I learned, none of it is important.  Just learn it, and forget it.  If someone needs it again, *seeing* will show you again.\n\nUntil this day, when the only worry in my mind was beginners who can't find colors.\n\nAnd \"seeing\" helped me,  by suggesting this technique.\n\nWill it work?  I don't know.  I can't test it.  I can already see colors.\n\nBut it should.\n\nHere's the reason for \"puffs\".    You might ask, why do we want \"puffs\"???\n\nBecause we are **all** lying bastards.\n\nWe cheat at solitaire.\n\nWe take a nightmare, and pretend it was OBE.  Or Lucid dreaming.\n\nWe endlessly pretend the result, just to get attention from other people.\n\nWe say we want \"A\".\n\nIf anyone asks we say, \"Yes, Yes, Yes!!  I really, really want 'A'.\"\n\nBut if \"A\" is too hard, we'll settle for \"B\".\n\nAnd then lie to people and say, \"No, you're wrong. That's 'A'!   The voice of seeing told me it was.  And the dreaming emissary said, it's a very good 'A'!  You know the emissary can't lie!!!\"\n\nOr, \"The Nagual Speedos drew a picture in his book. That's 'A' for sure!\"\n\nIt's not surprising we almost lost the teachings of don Juan.\n\nAnd there you have it. The reason we need the \"puffs\".  You can't lie to a \"puff\". They know what you are thinking.\n\nIt wasn't my idea!\n\nJust look at the Tensegrity long forms.  They \"scoop puffs\" and put them on your body.\n\nSometimes you even have to \"jump up\" to get the puff, because it's floating in the air.\n\nIn the Tensegrity long forms.  Unbending intent, long form, at 5:22 on Youtube.\n\nSo, CARLOS WANTED US TO FIND THE PUFFS.\n\nAnd the reason is simple.  If you can see the puff, you are silent.\n\nSo we need the \"puffs\" to keep us honest.\n\nBut how can we find a puff, before our assemblage point moves?\n\nObviously, when we drive our car we don't run into any puffs on the freeway.\n\nThere's none out there!\n\nIt's the first *intent* gift.  That's how you find a puff.   *Intent* wants us to learn also.\n\n\"The Spirit\" (intent) gives us a gift, to help us learn magic.\n\nSo when you show you are working hard, *intent* gives you the very first gift.\n\nColors in the darkness.\n\nTHEN, you can learn silence.  You gaze at the colors, and if you are more silent they are better colors.  If you are not silent, the colors go away.\n\nBut what to do if *intent* doesn't give you that \"first gift\"?\n\nTry this.\n\nFocus your \"awareness beam\".  On sight, sound, touch, heat/cold, or even, \"corridors\".\n\nWhen you start, your awareness is on your internal dialogue.\n\nOn fantasies.  Memories.  Problems. Sex.  Food.  The electric bill.\n\nSelf pity!\n\nYou are \"inside\" hell.  In your own mind.\n\nYou keep watching hell.\n\nAnd watching it.\n\nNever looking any other place.\n\nYou need to look away.\n\nThat's what this does.\n\nLook away from hell!\n\nDoes it work?\n\nI tried to test it last night.\n\nBut you can see, I can't test techniques for new people anymore.\n\nWhen I do it,  Mexico comes and sits on my lap.\n\nSo please, if you cannot find colors, try it.  But not one night!  Try it and keep trying it.\n\nUntil it works.\n\nThen explain to us, why you could not find colors before.\n\nEven children see the colors in the darkness!\n\nMaybe we can learn why adults sometimes cannot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Domains of Awareness", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/3d25cf64-9180-40a4-9c8e-5eb1570a7672", "link_ids": ["t3_jkedo9", "t3_ixrw34", "t3_iubqq2", "t3_kea5zt", "t3_lwckni", "t3_lwcg6o", "t3_lqz7b6", "t3_lqr6zf", "t3_lnt8a6", "t3_lmp574", "t3_lm4zws", "t3_ll9z5w", "t3_lelqm7", "t3_leo7sy", "t3_ld3845", "t3_lc1ls0", "t3_lbsls8", "t3_l7cp8f", "t3_l6o7at", "t3_mz3kz7", "t3_mzx9gl", "t3_m0kyjq", "t3_lwwshw", "t3_m1oqf1", "t3_mx3d2u", "t3_mw8sve", "t3_mtfwhb", "t3_m2u0a0", "t3_mrkitp", "t3_mlhy6f", "t3_mauwly", "t3_cm1zxx", "t3_m30hb1", "t3_n17jdy", "t3_n1ljja", "t3_n7pwp8", "t3_n7zeae", "t3_naznr8", "t3_nc8q8m", "t3_ndsc7q", "t3_neslbo", "t3_nfw7xg", "t3_nir9g2", "t3_nk25ms", "t3_nkyszq", "t3_nogrjo", "t3_ns7tky", "t3_nvehdz", "t3_o0ifzx", "t3_o3inhw", "t3_o53rhe", "t3_o7qp2a", "t3_ogafdn", "t3_org1tv", "t3_owrd1h", "t3_ovqmgq", "t3_oyt4zt", "t3_oxczfa", "t3_ogzoth", "t3_pcyx4h", "t3_p9anre", "t3_p8asd8", "t3_p6ga7i", "t3_p5l6ye", "t3_p0fmbc", "t3_ozfrz4", "t3_pij28q", "t3_posqcc", "t3_pu14ic", "t3_pwrrc0", "t3_pxfw1a", "t3_q1fcee", "t3_q4x5cs", "t3_q57hxg", "t3_q7jpwq", "t3_q7snvr", "t3_q9epxq", "t3_qceavx", "t3_qctyq7", "t3_qdp6bb", "t3_q9idzp", "t3_qklney", "t3_qmbwgp", "t3_qn9y63", "t3_qo8gj1", "t3_qpoc9e", "t3_qr6cta", "t3_qqyzj8", "t3_rwu1f0", "t3_rw73iz", "t3_rb5o0q", "t3_sdgq2p", "t3_sf44pk", "t3_te7jnl", "t3_tu3w80", "t3_tzc628"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 2", "created_at_utc": 1611109587.162, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "3d25cf64-9180-40a4-9c8e-5eb1570a7672", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1676831407.209, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"oqd5c75152v71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oqd5c75152v71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb31cd8438dee96c99b63467d2cbfcf351003fc0"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oqd5c75152v71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f5872332e4d220268aea6a2b02d11bd21eb7a24"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oqd5c75152v71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b50053e675aff9f66cd6f25c85177d9183d171f6"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oqd5c75152v71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8a126975a1232f1931e929d8bc3a8215629cd34"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oqd5c75152v71.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06bdb25634f0cc1b1c5bd24faae4ada6d80829c8"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oqd5c75152v71.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1deb1ce52baaee60ab6f26dd8ae6d179769011b"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oqd5c75152v71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cee82bd154915b9d122e82a16e3da5525cf0f69e"}, "id": "oqd5c75152v71"}}, "name": "t3_qdp6bb", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/QCoHkj_fvmcoRkgyUIuGU6Lhz-ihq1ajp3PKIUPRkco.jpg", "edited": 1634935803.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1634933412.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oqd5c75152v71.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cee82bd154915b9d122e82a16e3da5525cf0f69e\"&gt;Don&amp;#39;t try this at home...

And if it was only in the books of Carlos or  the witches I'd mention that, but try to connect it to something else I did, to give it some verification.\n\nJust want you to know, there's  no pretending in here. In fact, pretending gets people booted out.  The advanced ones in here know when something is made up to get attention.\n\nSo you wiggle your fingers to get some \"flicker\" or shiny bubbles in \"the wall\" of whitish light,  gaze at it, and it forms an entire world for you.\n\nA little \"remote view\" window in the air.\n\nYou can scoop those into your hand, and gaze into them.\n\nOr take  your spirit helper, and send her in.\n\nAnd sometimes you can walk right into that world!\n\nAfter you can do things like that nightly, for hours on end, every single day, you stop being overly concerned or obsessed with one time events.\n\nPeople starting out are intensely hoping for magic, so sinking into a \"green zone\" seems like a big deal.\n\nIt's cool, but not that important. Unless you can do it over and over, and find some \"practical application\", it's not worth bothering with.\n\nLikewise, be careful about lucid dreaming.\n\nIt means nothing, if you didn't look at your hands at the start, then look from object to object.\n\nOtherwise, it's just a nightmare about how much you'd like to learn sorcery.\n\nYou have to be PROVEN lucid, by finding your hands.\n\nAny other claim to lucidity leads to deceiving  yourself.\n\nWhich was done by everyone in the entire Castaneda community.  I always ask when they start bragging about their dreaming, and it always turns out, they made it up.\n\nI recommend don't think about sleeping dreaming much. It's a dead end until you can get silent.\n\nAbout your experience, which seems 3rd gate like, Carlos said it wasn't the real thing because the person who did it couldn't get silent.\n\nHe was being kind...\n\nLearn waking dreaming as fast as you can!\n\nEverything you do in sleeping dreaming is better done awake.\n\nAnd the double comes out much faster in waking dreaming.\n\nIn fact, no one has ever brought their double out using 4 gates dreaming.\n\nMost in fact, have only done 4 gates a few times, and all the rest was made up from ordinary dreams.\n\nOn the other hand, what you did indicates huge talent.\n\nYou could probably even learn to manifest objects.  Here's a picture of that.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/gvb3v4/pandoras\\_box\\_pass\\_how\\_to\\_manifest\\_things/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/gvb3v4/pandoras_box_pass_how_to_manifest_things/)\n\nThat movement was considered by Carlos, to be one of the most important things we could do at home.\n\nHe expected us to make it work in full light, but it's pretty hard to do that so we use darkness.\n\nIt's the \"squishing\" part that's key.\n\nIn the blue zone, there's nothing there to squish.\n\nIn the green zone, you might find some pink or purple smears \"out there\", and be able to scoop them over to where the puff is in that picture, by turning your head to make it look as if that happened. Then play with it.  As long as you can see the colors between your hands, you're doing fine.  But if you turn your head, and not your hands and body, the colors will not be between your hands. They will follow your gaze.\n\nIn the red zone, the colors turn REAL.  They are so intense, you can see jet black swirling around them. And flickers of blue on the edges.  You can squish them as if they were purple whipped cream.   If you can turn your head to the right and they are still in your hands, then you have passed a barrier.\n\nPlace the ball of light on one of those 3 magic spots on your torso.  Right side of visual stomach, left side, and smear across the breast area.  But go find the comic book page 2 to see the precise spots. It's important to do that, so you build an energy body for your double to move into.\n\nIf you keep doing that  until the room is empty of colored light, you will pass below the bottom on the J curve.\n\nOn the other side, in the orange zone, you can start to manifest objects with this movement.\n\nIt works!\n\nSo just a warning:\n\nDon't take what people tell you about \"green zones\" and such to be particularly important. Or to be a path you can use.\n\nThat's the book deal mind at work.  The belief that there's some \"secret technique\" you can do a few times, and now you are qualified to go out and teach, and are \"the real thing\".\n\nIn fact, it's a 1000 mile road we're headed down.\n\nAnd you can't travel  more than 1 mile per night.  We don't have the energy to go further.\n\nIn sleeping dreaming, you can't even travel that 1 mile.  You'll be lucky to move an inch.\n\nBut it's lovely over in the Orange zone!

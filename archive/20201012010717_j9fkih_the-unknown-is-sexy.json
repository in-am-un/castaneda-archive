Stretch your arms as high as you can (shoulder distended but not hurting), either both at once, or one at a time, and pull the top of the hand back towards you, until you feel cobwebs on the tops of the hands. If you can't catch any that way, put your hand out to the side, still pulling the back of the hand towards the place way above your head, hoping to catch some cobwebs.\n\nThey like that energy.

Gaze over the hand smoothly turning body and arm.\n\nIf you see whitish light on the walls (which means you've been at it a while), try to see your arms.

And then you realize the absurdity of doubting it.  It's right there!  And the room is pitch black!!!\n\nWhat more do you want?\n\nI saw that there were 2 Cholitas working hard on building something.

If she floats near it, go ahead and scoop her up with the back of the hand, using the &amp;quot;non-directional&amp;quot; tricks to make it seem as if she&amp;#39;s stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry if she really is, you&amp;#39;re just trying to let her know what you want, and not actually trapping her on there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Black arms are like blackness mixed in with the swirling purple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very powerful for finger wiggling.  And quite stunning to see that your arm is fully black and easy to see, and yet the room is already pitch black.  So how can the arm be so black that it&amp;#39;s visible?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably because it scoops up purple on the edges, and it burns there, giving the impression the black is even blacker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(You&amp;#39;re turning Fairy into a power object).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After what must be weeks of notes each night, I still end up with pages and pages of refinements, from Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She swapped the order of moves last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after 10 passes I could see through the bedroom wall, and into the living room and Cholita&amp;#39;s room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was almost like those IR pics they take of people inside buildings. Except with the vagueness of the second attention.  Probably like what Lidotska saw with her crystal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see it, but you feel a little guilty for believing that, because it doesn&amp;#39;t conform to Mr. DoubleTake standards of &amp;quot;realness&amp;quot;.  And then you realize the absurdity of doubting it.  It&amp;#39;s right there!  And the room is pitch black!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What more do you want?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw that there were 2 Cholitas working hard on building something.  One fussing around with a grinder on her bed, the other moving on the other side of the living room, too fast to be human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what that means.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually I only see Cholita at a distance, when she&amp;#39;s asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was probably building an art object for a seller in the fancy area of LA.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_j9fkih", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/j9fkih/the_unknown_is_sexy/g8myk02/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1602542586.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1602542586.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g8mpltv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1602537671.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g8mjgn5", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Yesterday I've been trying to stick Fairy to my hand, as I saw you do with Fancy.

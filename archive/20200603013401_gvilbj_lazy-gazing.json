Nonsense!](https://preview.redd.it/hx0t7o3twk251.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=728f2f05f45e9efd8d7d32e919c63bc41c6ba53a)\n\nSo what\u2019s supposed to happen when you do gazing?\n\nANYTHING!\n\nIt\u2019s a complete path. This morning, around 6AM, I assembled another world using it.\n\nRemember: You can assemble another world when your assemblage point moves far enough.\n\nYou can move the assemblage point by watching anything coming from the second attention, while mentally silent.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t much matter what you watch. A little \u201cgazing weirdness\u201d is enough.\n\nGazing weirdness, from the examples I\u2019ve heard, consists mostly of weird geometric shapes or lines.\n\nBut it also includes fast dreams. That means, blanking out for an instant, coming back, and remembering a dream.\n\nAt first you\u2019ll be thinking, \u201cWhat was that? Did I just have a dream?\u201d\n\nBut you won\u2019t be sure. It seems too odd.\n\nThat\u2019s because we\u2019ve been trained to ignore that.\n\nNothing to see here! Just a momentary lapse of concentration\u2026\n\nYea, right.\n\nWe ignore most weirdness, which is probably what you might call our \u201cshields\u201d.\n\nOur shields protects us from \u201cthe onslaught of the unknown\u201d.\n\nWell, that\u2019s what you see in that picture. The onslaught.\n\nDoes it look all that bad? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nGazing is a good technique if you haven\u2019t learned to be silent. The gazing itself puts your awareness on a fixed image, which interrupts the internal dialogue all by itself. And the concentration produces a tendency to fall asleep. To drift off, fail to pay attention, get bored and blank out.\n\nCall it what you like, but you can sneak past the internal dialogue with gazing.\n\nIn relation to what I've posted here, if you want to stop the world you first need to be silent.\n\nThen you need to get rid of the images that drive the internal dialogue.\n\nThen you need to get Mr. DoubleTake to give it a rest.\n\nThen the world stops.\n\nAnd there in lies the genius of gazing!\n\nGazing doesn't make you silent.  At least, not in the ordinary sense.\n\nBut it reduces the internal dialogue.  As long as you concentrate, it's like holding those crystals or rocks between your fingers, squeezing hard.\n\nIf you have any silence at all, even just a tiny bit, you can make it stronger.\n\nBut then, even though the silence is not perfect, it gets rid of those images in the mind, which drive the internal dialogue!\n\nBecause you're concentrating on a real image.\n\nWhat genius! The very thing that drives the internal dialogue, is shut off.\n\nIn that state, you get to taunt Mr. DoubleTake with a scene so boring to him, that he dozes off.\n\nAnd the weirdness comes out.\n\nThat's why Gazing is the fastest path of all.\n\nIn this case, I can in fact get silent. No problem these days.  So I didn't need the extra boost from \"cheating\", which gazing gives us.\n\nBut that morning I\u2019d just had all of my powers taken away.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nCholita ran away again, and took all of my inorganic beings with her.\n\nNone would come to visit for the last 2 days.\n\nI needed a boost.\n\nSomeone mentioned not-doing, so I spent a long time during the day, walking backwards while looking at cell phone glitter.\n\nThen in silence, I let leaves blowing in the wind determine which direction I was walking while gazing at cellphone glitter.\n\nWhen the night came, I was shocked at the results of those not-doings.\n\nAll of the colors were gone.\n\nIt was horrible.\n\nI thought to myself, is this what it feels like for a beginner?  And for how long do they have to put up with that?\n\nExcept, the colors weren\u2019t gone.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize, I\u2019d \u201cflipped\u201d them.  The not-doing had caused them to switch to something else.\n\nThey were still there.\n\nBut as a form I\u2019ve learned to ignore.\n\nJust as I\u2019d learned to ignore gazing weirdness, these particular colors were out of the range of anything I\u2019d notice.\n\nThey weren\u2019t nice bright blobs of color.\n\nAll I was seeing was gazing weirdness. And not very bright.\n\nLittle mistakes in reality, floating in the dark.\n\nLike what you see in that picture.\n\nI spent 3 hours trying to get back the colors.\n\nThen around 5AM, I heard a door slam.\n\nThat was followed by Cholita shouting.  She was home.\n\n\u201cSo THIS woman says\u2026\u201d\n\nI got up and walked closer to the door. I was happy to hear Cholita was angry with someone else, and not only me.\n\nI sat back on the bed waiting for colors, thinking maybe Cholita had brought back Fairy and Minx.\n\nShe continued to shout.  It created tingles of fright in my body.\n\n\u201cIF THOSE COMMUNISTS WANT TO RUN AROUND WITH THEIR BUTTS HANGING OUT, THEN GO AHEAD!\u201d\n\nA shiver went up my spine, and the colors resumed floating in the air.\n\nIt was as if the tingle going up my spine were an elevator, and I arrived at the floor where the colors were visible.\n\nThere was an intense purple blob, and swirls of blackness just waiting to be scooped.\n\nI was relieved.\n\nBut then I noticed, those weirdness colors I\u2019d ignored, were kind of interesting.\n\nMy thought was, \u201cTake what you get! Don\u2019t expect what you want!\u201d\n\nThat only puts limitations on you.\n\nForget the book deals. Forget the books. Forget your inventory.\n\nTake what you get.\n\nAnd gaze at that. Anything will move the assemblage point.\n\nBut I was still wanting what I expected, so out of caution I spent a while scooping colors into the spot Zuleica described, while wiggling my fingers.\n\nEventually I could actually see my hands. The sun was up, leaking through the edges of the cardboard covering my windows.\n\nI watched my fingers wiggle, thinking maybe I could see fibers of yellow light if they were more visible than in absolute darkness.\n\nThen I remembered.\n\nI\u2019d done successful gazing 30 years ago. In a bathtub.\n\nI learned, if you are in a room with reduced light, like in the bath with the lights off, then even if it isn't perfectly dark, you can squint your eyes and look at your hand until it becomes a weird looking black blob.\n\nIt looks so alien that even back 30 years ago I thought it might be a useful technique.\n\nI learned to squint and turn my hands, feet, knees, and the bathtub faucet into  weird black blobs.\n\nBut no one had told me, that is a valid gazing technique.  So I never learned to use it.\n\nUsually people make excuses not to gaze. They haven\u2019t found the \u201cright spot\u201d, the right fern, the sun isn\u2019t right for dark shadows.\n\nThere are endless reasons not to practice.\n\nBut as it turns out, all you need is your hand. And to squint.\n\nSubdued lighting is a bonus, but probably not mandatory.\n\nYou can do this just about anywhere.\n\nJust learn to make your hand into a weird blob by squinting. I suspect I was only using one eye most of the time. I tried both eyes to make sure. It was harder.  So I stuck with one eye.\n\nKeep watching for weirdness.\n\nNot weirdness you expect. Just whatever weirdness.\n\nAnd force yourself silent. Or if you can\u2019t, try to flood the eyes with peripheral vision. Try to take in the entire sheet with all of its wrinkles, below you while you sit up on the bed.\n\nIf you get the \u201cAlien\u201d feeling, I believe you are almost there.\n\nThe instant you detect some weirdness, remember this:  Do not expect anything specific.\n\nYou aren\u2019t waiting for something magical to happen!\n\nYou\u2019re waiting for your assemblage point to move.\n\nWhen it moves far enough, that\u2019s when \u201csomething happens\u201d.\n\nIn this case, I got a lovely view of a lone tree on a lonely landscape, in an alien world.\n\nI was fully awake, watching a dream on my bed sheet.\n\nFairy flew in to see what was going on.\n\nI coughed. But I forgot to cover my mouth with a pillow.\n\nCholita screamed, \u201cStop the GOD DAMNED COUGHING you sick old bastard!!!!\u201d\n\nI was happy Cholita was home.\n\nEdited twice", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Lazy Gazing", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Shifting Perception"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"hx0t7o3twk251": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 126, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hx0t7o3twk251.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5ce2f0dc1f42f6bd3459899d6a43052fa50b079"}, {"y": 252, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hx0t7o3twk251.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e273f6d247f53f558e0200ffe1f8e43ae66ce002"}, {"y": 373, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hx0t7o3twk251.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f576d700056e1f25fddd3a2828bc71687989896c"}, {"y": 746, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hx0t7o3twk251.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=577ab83bd9f0b1bf543d3a6d087c8569cd6e9d70"}, {"y": 1120, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hx0t7o3twk251.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4bc3f5a148c8a22e8900dfd14fd49645e98203a"}], "s": {"y": 1120, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hx0t7o3twk251.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=728f2f05f45e9efd8d7d32e919c63bc41c6ba53a"}, "id": "hx0t7o3twk251"}}, "name": "t3_gvilbj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Shifting Perception", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/cGuNXN8bP-rqWp1OHw36-KZ_PaiebWiyWzN1IyYO_Lg.jpg", "edited": 1591143052.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1591140841.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hx0t7o3twk251.jpg?width=960&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=728f2f05f45e9efd8d7d32e919c63bc41c6ba53a\"&gt;Don&amp;#39;t have the right location for Gazing?

Carlos was already in heightened awareness when he used that technique, we aren\u2019t,  so we need to do something to remain awake.\n\nThat can include slapping yourself on the face (I do that often to prevent passing into unconsciousness from silence), or, less painfully,  walking around looking for colors everywhere you can find.\n\nI slap myself when I'm too lazy to walk around.\n\nI added, \u201cfinding your spot\u201d to Zuleica\u2019s technique for activating the second attention's energy body.  They\u2019re really the same technique.\n\nI don\u2019t modify more than that.  I\u2019m just trying to make those actually work, instead of just pretending that they might work someday, when you get around to trying them out as you knew you ought to have when you first read them in Carlos\u2019 books.\n\nDidn\u2019t some of you notice watching for colors in the darkness, but never got around to trying it?\n\nWhat were you waiting for, fuzzy pajamas?\n\nMe too.\n\nI should have tried those 30 years ago.\n\nUnfortunately, most people have spouses, cats, dogs, children, parakeets,  mother's in law, goldfish, gerbils,  and other crucial things in their lives, which prevent them from having a fully dark room.  \n\nThey\u2019ve loaded themselves up with stuff to fight off self-pity, following the \"group decisions\" already made for them before they were born, and there\u2019s no room left over for escaping the social order.\n\nThat\u2019s the back and forth, horizontal motion, of the energy center on top of the head, as mentioned in Westwood pass notes in Carlos\u2019 tensegrity book.\n\nIt\u2019s been hijacked, by self-pity. It should rotate counter clockwise.  The back and forth is a foreign installation.\n\nAnd the inability to make decisions other than those already planned for them at birth, seem to be a function of that V spot having been depleted as mentioned in the explanations for the Westwood series.\n\nMy darkness techniques require searching for colors, and seem to take 1 hour to reach full visibility.  That\u2019s about how long it takes the eyes to fully adjust to the darkness.  \n\nBut a dim red color of light is said to not prevent that process of adjusting the eye to darkness.\n\nI had in mind to gradually turn up the lights in my own practice room, to figure out how dark it really needs to be, using an elaborate computer light system I might have had to build myself.\n\nIt was suggested that it might be easier to just try the photography bulb.  At the least, I could find out if it's the presence of light, or the inability of the eyes to reach full light sensitivity.\n\nI couldn't get around to it because Cholita was on the rampage. She's a suicidal former witch from Carlos\u2019 private classes who can move dim sum plates with her eyes.  Carlos put some special attention into her.\n\nSo I'm protecting her. But she's flown the coop for a while, so I had a chance to try out the red light bulb.\n\nIf you practice looking for colors in darkness, but can't have total darkness, the red bulb seems to bring out more filaments in the light show.  I'd expect that dim light would do the same.\n\nThe colors you can see in darkness include puffs of color, spinning colors with jet black making a sort of yin-yang rotating affair, vague lines which can fall on flat surfaces, bright red, white, blue, and maybe even green dots of brilliant color,  and yes, bright fibers or fragments of fibers.  \n\nAmazingly bright fibers, which seem to be aware when you gaze at them.\n\nThat there are more of them with the red bulb isn't necessarily due to the light itself. It could be that finding colors in dim light is that much harder than in full darkness, and when you succeed, you're in a different position of the assemblage point where it\u2019s easier to see the fibers.\n\nMy conclusion from around 6 hours of red light bulb gazing is that it is absolutely possible to do what I do in total darkness, in a room lit by a 15 watt red photography dark room bulb.  \n\nBut put it near the floor,  under a table, so that it radiates out on the bottom of the walls. If it's directly lighting a wall, dreaming images will fade when you turn that direction, because the visible objects there will pull the assemblage point away from dreaming.\n\nI guess that means, it doesn't have to be perfectly dark.  But evenly illuminated is nice.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine why anyone would turn on the red bulb, in a room capable of being dark. Unless you were worried about bumping into things. In that case, it's a good choice.\n\nThe difference seems to be that the puffs of color you\u2019ll eventually find,  might tend to have more pronounced fibers in them.  \n\nEmanations probably.\n\nIncluding the coveted highly colored ones.   The red ones are what I've been trying to study lately. Cholita has 3 of them visible if you can gaze at her second attention energy body \u201capron\u201d, and la Gorda used that type for flying.  \n\nShe peed in her hands, flicked it up into the air (similar to a tensegrity move \"teasing the web\"), and then grabbed hold of the red lines thus formed.\n\nI'm loathe to pee in my hands, and used water instead the last time I tried it out.  \n\nI got the red lines to form, but they were mere fragments.  My fairy liked them, consumed them, and made a full-sized manifestation for me.\n\nIn a very unsorceress like Japanese Sailor Suit.   She truly should be ashamed of that.\n\nI'm making fun of people who don't read the books thoroughly, and then complain about sailor suits not being dignified enough for a sorcerer.\n\nWhatever you\u2019ve got left over in consciousness, is what comes out with inorganic beings.\n\nI just happened to have spent a lot of time in Japan. \n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1577393389.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fc3kdlp", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess this is as good of a place as any to report results of that red light bulb test.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Historical context for anyone landing here first (a bad place to start from because you have no context).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have some techniques to learn to change worlds and summon inorganics, but they require total darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique from Eagle&amp;#39;s Gift, plus \u201cthe wall\u201d, as taught by Carlos in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t make up techniques, but I am willing to modify them slightly, within reason.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, extend, \u201cthe wall\u201d to the entire room and you can use it to assemble other worlds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, walk around while doing Zuleica\u2019s technique, so you don\u2019t fall asleep.

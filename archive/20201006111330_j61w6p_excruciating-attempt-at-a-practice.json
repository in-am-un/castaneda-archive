My Jedi blackout training helmet from Denmark still hasn\u2019t arrived.\n\nBut regardless I tried 2/3 hours of open eyed (not very dark) dark room practice. \n\nFor the first 2 hours it was a steady stream of domestic interruptions; combination of dog scratching, girlfriend constantly kicking me in her sleep, dog wanting out, me letting dog out. Landlord having heating up too high, dog panting being too hot, landlord watching soaps too loud past midnight probably drunk, me having to turn heating down, bump into drunk landlord who tells me job she wants done today, dog wanting back out, girlfriend waking up. \n\nI\u2019d had an almost undisturbed evening until my girlfriend finally fell asleep when I began practice, then, like a practical joke on someone for taking something seriously, this 2 hour atleast consecutive string of disturbances began. \n\nMy dog never wants out two times in a row in one night, he gets irritable, you let him out, he comes back in he sleeps. Last night I let him out, he got irritable again, I let him out again. I was like be honest dog are you fucking with me? Really when I\u2019m trying this?\n\nSilence was my focus, through out every single moment of this. Even during the disturbances. Shut up shut up silence. Aware of the world as it is. Listen instead of look. Shut up shut up silence. CONSTANTLY I was forcing this. \n\nBesides the disturbances my eyes were first trying to concentrate on the darkest parts of my room. That was above the tv and the lower half of the book shelf. \n\nStraining silence that first hour wasn\u2019t fun, especially with the continued disturbances. \n\nApproaching an hour my eyes had drifted instead to the details of the brugmansia plant in front of my bed, instead of the darker parts.\n\nI noticed some success here in that I began to get for a few seconds at a time the plant completely disappearing as in going pitch black along with other large sections of my room that weren\u2019t in pitch blackness.\n\nI know atleast from practices with scrying in the past that that enveloping darkness means something\u2019s happening. Obviously if the room was in the complete dark this may not have been detectable. \n\nI was throwing everything I had at silence, every trick I knew, I was getting there slowly but surely. Each consecutive time I\u2019d have to get up and deal with one of the disturbances I felt less thoughts in my head.\n\nBy the time my landlord was drunkenly explaining how she wanted the greenhouse fleeced (with fleece she bought that isn\u2019t designed for nor big enough for fleecing greenhouses) I felt in a deep trance, I don\u2019t think I looked at her once. \nI took the fleece and studied it closely. I was soothed by its texture, I was put off from reading the words on the packaging I thought they\u2019d break this silence thing I had going but I read one and it wasn\u2019t much of a threat so I continued to read the packing, in its entirety, in a strange way. \n\nI felt completely aware of the situation without looking at her or anyone. While I was transfixed on this fabric as if I was on acid I was aware of exactly where the dog was running and what he was doing. I didn\u2019t look at him once either. \n\nEverytime after a disturbance I\u2019d come back up into the room and sit on the same spot and I\u2019d get back to where I was quite quickly. After the third time I\u2019d came back in the room my girlfriend woke up.\n\nShe asked me if I was ok, the sound of her voice compared to the omnipresent effort of me trying to project my silence onto the wall infront of me was so quiet she could have been a sparrow squeaking 2 feet under ground. \u201cYes I\u2019m fine why?\u201d\n\nShe went back to sleep. I got darkness taking over my vision again a couple of times. It must have been in the third hour that I began to pick up very slight hints at energy swoops and balls coming through.  \n\nA slight purple static cloud of changing size appearing above the television on the wall. Getting this brighter was not any easier in this third hour particularly. Getting this to remain there was also not easier particularly. The fact it was there at all I suppose was progress on the first 2 hours.\n\nI can\u2019t say there was a disturbance at all in the third hour. Just finally me being able to practice undisturbed. \n\nStill I continued, there would be intermittent everything/large sections turning pitch black. Dancing energy clouds forming. The ODD little twinkling orb. The odd little out of nowhere swoop. All very faint. When I\u2019ve seen the purple puffs in second attention with eyes closed they\u2019re extremely bright and gaseous. These energy balls, in a non dark room with  eyes open street light shining through were different, fainter, happened to be larger this time? \n\nSo I have to admit, by hour 3 I was getting little hints of stuff coming through.\n\nI wonder what I would have got had I done the whole 3 hours undisturbed? \n\nSilence was my main goal last night. I was getting it, for little tiny blasts at a time. \n\nI\u2019m working today so had to call it off at some point and say bed time. You\u2019d think I\u2019d be going to sleep disturbed or angry frustrated but no I was just going to sleep quite silent. The disturbances were bullshit, the thread running through everything that happened last night was me slowly putting a dampener on every little word that came into my head.  \n\nI went to bed with in the back of mind a hope for closed eye second attention or lucid dreaming but this was a quiet hope and not at the forefront. I wasn\u2019t allowing much to the forefront at any point. \n\nWhen my inner dialogue was really bad at the start/first hour I was using \u201com mane padme hum,\u201d but only saying it when the dialogue got too loud. So if a thought came in id go \u201cOM,\u201d then not continue the mantra and keep it silent for as long as possible then if another thought came I\u2019d continue \u201cMMMAANNNNNE,\u201d until the thought was suppressed and I felt silent then hold that for as long as possible then if another thought arise you\u2019d combat at with \u201cPADDDD,\u201d.....*silence*.......*thought* - \u201c-MEE HUM,\u201d  you see? It wasn\u2019t bad at helping hope this can help someone else. I was just using it for the first hour or so.\n\nAfter that it became more me just trying to project pure awareness up thru my neck and out my eyes and forehead like a cobra. This is harder to describe but worked for me and replaced using om mane padme hum. \n\n\nWell done anyone who got to the end. Hopefully if anything this can just lend a little support to anyone who isn\u2019t getting much success or finding it hard to practice - I can\u2019t be the only one.... right? \ud83e\udd14", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Excruciating attempt at a practice.", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "link_ids": ["t3_ifu1bv", "t3_if5koq", "t3_ienqgj", "t3_ie01zd", "t3_idn0fa", "t3_idh7ju", "t3_iczlw5", "t3_icv2ot", "t3_irms6p", "t3_irglig", "t3_iqzit7", "t3_iq7jdg", "t3_iof5ib", "t3_invu3w", "t3_imlozg", "t3_ilzfhg", "t3_ildkri", "t3_ijgd33", "t3_iixdqk", "t3_ihms98", "t3_ih21eh", "t3_ih44uo", "t3_igh7ta", "t3_igday4", "t3_jcxlwj", "t3_hp41du", "t3_kdsew2", "t3_kz7y8a", "t3_kz75ql", "t3_kw4lpr", "t3_kvqj52", "t3_knpzzc", "t3_km2pzf", "t3_kj29l8", "t3_kd0b1h", "t3_k641wo", "t3_k4jrfq", "t3_k2paj7", "t3_k2dn7a", "t3_k1fwwj", "t3_jqlctf", "t3_jq09jk", "t3_jp4g2x", "t3_jng0bx", "t3_jmu5w3", "t3_jmsrw3", "t3_jm1fxl", "t3_jkklgr", "t3_jikxdd", "t3_jhb6f9", "t3_jh8142", "t3_jglh8m", "t3_jgb5mx", "t3_jg53re", "t3_jfoaai", "t3_jf4c1u", "t3_je4gyw", "t3_jdlcth", "t3_jby6ff", "t3_jadwdo", "t3_j9fkih", "t3_j96xwg", "t3_j8rmcm", "t3_j7c8fa", "t3_j65s10", "t3_j61w6p", "t3_j43yai", "t3_j40bem", "t3_j3eykq", "t3_j2jxyx", "t3_j261xv", "t3_j1vngl", "t3_j0g2nl", "t3_izm9cx", "t3_iyhkny", "t3_ix9ipe", "t3_ix5a4g", "t3_iw29ja", "t3_iverkv", "t3_iu3yxd", "t3_isv81g", "t3_isnn0y", "t3_ic1ppo", "t3_i9fbj8", "t3_i8kcue", "t3_i795h6", "t3_i5o2m4", "t3_i4tqjj", "t3_i3o4mq", "t3_i2ha3h", "t3_i1ch4u", "t3_i0s7jm", "t3_hzfk4m", "t3_hx8xej", "t3_iyz5md", "t3_ljjdbn", "t3_lfo0wa", "t3_lgzmsv"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 1", "created_at_utc": 1598295005.319, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1620558726.961, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_j61w6p", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1601992380.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1601975610.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still don\u2019t have a fully dark room, still no curtains, still a street light outside.

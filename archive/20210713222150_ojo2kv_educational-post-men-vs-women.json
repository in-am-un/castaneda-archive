follow a magical trail left by the Olmecs, from thousands of years ago.\n\nWithout that trail, magic is impossible.\n\nAnd the Olmecs lived 10,000 years ago.\n\nFrankly, if you think about how a football team might have dealt with women back in the 1950s, the Olmecs were worse.\n\nBy modern standards, their teaching methods were horrible at times.\n\nBut it worked.\n\nAnd as it turns out, the original sorcerers might have been mostly women.\n\nSo to apply modern standards to how it goes on in a traditional sorcery group, is not going to look good.\n\nFor example, Juan Tuma, one of the most interesting teachers in the generation before us,  stuck his scrotum (I'm not sure what body part that even is), in the face of Carol Tiggs, and made her stare at it for a long time.\n\nAnd then Carol Tiggs was in a church in Tula, having sex with an 8000 year old sorcerer from our past, who had transformed himself into a woman.  To escape the spirit realm.  He was \"given\" to the spirits, and had to transform to a woman to sneak away.\n\nLa Gorda, one of the most talented witches in the last generation, could pee in her hands, then flick the urine up into the air, and climb the red lines that formed that way, like a ladder.\n\nIt's a flying technique.\n\nI tried it at home, but I couldn't get Cholita to do it for me.\n\nCholita agreed to pee in her hands (I didn't want to), but by the time there was any chance to get her to try (she's quite insane), she had decided I was part of a plan created by the Masonic temple, to hold her prisoner for sex trafficking.\n\nSo I had to do it myself.\n\nI used water instead of pee.\n\nBut, it worked!  I flicked the water into the air, and intense red lines formed in front of me, vibrating like an electric current was in them.\n\nMy inorganic being at that time was Fairy.\n\nShe used to come to me as scary male forms, but I convinced her to turn into a 4 inch tall fairy.\n\nShe swallowed the reddish lines!\n\nBefore I could grab them, they were gone.\n\nI walked over to where they had last been in the room, to see what was left.\n\nThere was Fairy, passed out on the floor, in a see through lingerie outfit like Sailor Moon might wear.\n\nShe was so real, I was horrified.  There was absolutely no way to tell her from a real woman who had wandered in my room and passed out on the floor.\n\nI moved down closer to her on the floor, feeling guilty for doing that, to see how real she was.\n\nShe was real all right.  Naked, except for a Sailor Suit see through, white outfit.\n\nSo bottom line:  You can't apply normal social standards to sorcery.\n\nThe social standards are what keeps everyone prisoner.\n\nTelling them what's real, what's ok, what's not ok.\n\nAll designed to imprison you in the \"normal life path\" that obviously never works for anyone.\n\nI suppose you have to be past 55 to realize that.\n\nIt NEVER works.  But by the time you realize you were tricked, you're too old to escape, so you just brainwash the grandchildren to repeat your bad life path.\n\nAt any rate, as a result of all of the bad press out there, I am forbidden to take any money, I can't have sex with anyone, and can't behave in any way, which causes people to say, \"That's what he's REALLY after\".\n\nI also have other rules, I don't mention in here.\n\nSo there's no cult, no meeting, and no chance for anyone to be exploited.\n\nProbably the only way people in here will ever meet someone else from here, is if they rise to full sorcery power, and can share dreaming with the other person (which will take them rising to full power also).\n\nYou won't find support for this path anywhere.  Everyone you know will try to stop it.\n\nEven if you're only reading here and practicing on your own.\n\nThe entire world will try to stop it at one point.\n\nIt's built into the system.", "edited": 1647386593.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i0tda6g", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t understand this, but we follow a magical trail left by the Olmecs, from thousands of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without that trail, magic is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the Olmecs lived 10,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, if you think about how a football team might have dealt with women back in the 1950s, the Olmecs were worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By modern standards, their teaching methods were horrible at times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as it turns out, the original sorcerers might have been mostly women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to apply modern standards to how it goes on in a traditional sorcery group, is not going to look good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, Juan Tuma, one of the most interesting teachers in the generation before us,  stuck his scrotum (I&amp;#39;m not sure what body part that even is), in the face of Carol Tiggs, and made her stare at it for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then Carol Tiggs was in a church in Tula, having sex with an 8000 year old sorcerer from our past, who had transformed himself into a woman.

I flicked the water into the air, and intense red lines formed in front of me, vibrating like an electric current was in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My inorganic being at that time was Fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She used to come to me as scary male forms, but I convinced her to turn into a 4 inch tall fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She swallowed the reddish lines!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I could grab them, they were gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked over to where they had last been in the room, to see what was left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was Fairy, passed out on the floor, in a see through lingerie outfit like Sailor Moon might wear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was so real, I was horrified.  There was absolutely no way to tell her from a real woman who had wandered in my room and passed out on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved down closer to her on the floor, feeling guilty for doing that, to see how real she was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was real all right.  Naked, except for a Sailor Suit see through, white outfit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So bottom line:  You can&amp;#39;t apply normal social standards to sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The social standards are what keeps everyone prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Telling them what&amp;#39;s real, what&amp;#39;s ok, what&amp;#39;s not ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All designed to imprison you in the &amp;quot;normal life path&amp;quot; that obviously never works for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you have to be past 55 to realize that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It NEVER works.  But by the time you realize you were tricked, you&amp;#39;re too old to escape, so you just brainwash the grandchildren to repeat your bad life path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At any rate, as a result of all of the bad press out there, I am forbidden to take any money, I can&amp;#39;t have sex with anyone, and can&amp;#39;t behave in any way, which causes people to say, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s REALLY after&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also have other rules, I don&amp;#39;t mention in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s no cult, no meeting, and no chance for anyone to be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably the only way people in here will ever meet someone else from here, is if they rise to full sorcery power, and can share dreaming with the other person (which will take them rising to full power also).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t find support for this path anywhere.  Everyone you know will try to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you&amp;#39;re only reading here and practicing on your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire world will try to stop it at one point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s built into the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null,

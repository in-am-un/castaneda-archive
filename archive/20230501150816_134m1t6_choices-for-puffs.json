Not to say that behaving that way isn\u2019t something that humanity desperately needs in general, but it can go much further than that.\n\nAnd so, having got caught in the new age trap, they continue to filter new information like what is found here through the filter they\u2019ve built in their new belief system to see if it \u201cresonates\u201d. They gloss right over the real information and techniques that are in this subreddit and go straight to thinking this is a cult following Sri Daniel L. They don\u2019t even see that what they think about this place is actually what\u2019s going on in all of the books and YouTube content they absorb about Angels and pleiadians, \u201cspeaking your truth\u201d, \u201cshadow work\u201d it goes on and on.  Spiritual and religious flavour completely slopped all over the nugget of truth somewhere in there, and countless people trying to manifest their riches by rehashing all the same garbage with their new \u201cintuitions\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a serious trap.  And people not really looking for the truth in everything won\u2019t see it because it feels so good.  \n\nNew age Superiority.  The feeling that they know something that others don\u2019t, and even if they won\u2019t admit it to themselves they like to rub it in other people\u2019s faces.  That lady is a good example, repeating over and over that she\u2019s \u201cleaving\u201d yet continuing to come back and post more retorts with her superior knowledge. But she doesn\u2019t see it.\n\nAnd since we don\u2019t share all of our personal struggles with our own inside shit here, they think we don\u2019t do any of that ourselves and just \u201cproject\u201d onto them and so they leave little cute smirky comments like they\u2019ve \u201cuncovered\u201d something for you to work on, with smilies and hearts all in a row after it, not really listening to the words they\u2019re saying and realizing they\u2019re saying them for themselves to hear.

They can help you go deeper.\n\nAt first it is not obvious, but the name that witches gave it, \"waking dreaming\", is the most appropriate for me. If you manage to silence the mind, you will see that.\n\nWhile knowing it is a type of dreaming, Don Juan's explanation of \"how to prepare the dream\" makes a lot of sense. He affirms that one must learn to direct the attention to different objects in dreams. That's because you need your assemblage point to move deeper, which means that the dream becomes more real and stable, until it stands on its own.\n\nThe darkroom helps a lot, as you allow the energy to project freely on your walls, without distractions.\n\nWhile going deeper, you will find total bliss states, crazy visions, assamble other worlds, intercept dreams. You can learn to do lots of things. Just look at Dan's posts...\n\n\\&gt; Is there a book I should start with to clear things up?

Those just lead to egotism and a false sense of superiority, based on nearly nothing at all.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joggers high perhaps.  Certainly nothing as amazing as even mediocre witches can do, when they manipulate consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s what motivated the hippy movement, other than being anti-war and anti-1950s social structure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re here to restore the reputation of Carlos, which was thoroughly trashed by his enemies once he died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing you hear complained about him, is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if there&amp;#39;s some truth to it, it&amp;#39;s just how this form of magic (which the Jedi in Star Wars are based on) has always been practiced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could sum it all up for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t a physical body at all, and there&amp;#39;s no such thing as time or space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re blobs of awareness fixed in position on a vast ocean of infinite fibers which can glow when that awareness flows into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sends back a stream of sensations and feelings, which we use to build our &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get to see this visibly yourself some day!  There are no &amp;quot;theories&amp;quot; in real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the flow also carries a &amp;quot;history&amp;quot;,  and so to us it feels absolutely real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very much as when you find yourself in a dream, believing you&amp;#39;ve lived in that place all your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery allows you to change to a different flow of reality, and you completely transform into someone else while viewing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can do less drastic things than that for &amp;quot;practical magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Including amazing things like levitating objects (like the Jedi do), or walking through solid walls (the way Luke did in his final movie where he left the world).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In here, you can learn to be a &amp;quot;Jedi&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And best of all, no one wants your money in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1auspyr", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1auspyr/womb_dreaming_part_1_storyboard/kx985by/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1711808369.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kx75l2y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "AngelicSnail", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1711764396.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1auspyr", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_mtfu5z3", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I accidentally stumbled across one of your comments on an old post.

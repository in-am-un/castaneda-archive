So no one takes sides, and even the crazy angry men might stop themselves for long enough to rethink what they're doing.  If we could channel their anger into the real thing, who knows what could happen?\n\nThis picture is from a post possibly 6 to 8 months ago. And Fairy was much sweeter looking than that.  It's hard to find a picture of \"Fairy sitting on bed, looking up in silent scream.\"\n\nYou get pictures of men tied up during cosplay.\n\nBut Fairy did tend to hide in the blankets back then, even using them to make a point.\n\nNo sound came from her mouth. I  believe this was the third of three total faces she made, to warn me something was about to happen.\n\nLittle Smoke did a whole series of body changes, but it was a long time ago.  Unlike our sustained action \"gotcha\" friend, I'm not afraid to get an account a bit wrong, months later. That's how the real world works.  Go watch Rashomon to understand.

I was spellbound by Little Smoke's transformation from Asian military officer, to scary figure, to college professor with pipe.\n\nAnd when I looked away from him, a gigantic metal door pushed out from the bedroom wall, as if it were expanding with each breath.  When it was fully formed it was stable as anything. I could glance at any detail.  I could probably have gotten up to touch it, except I was worried it might be dangerous.\n\nNow I know, I had simply assembled another world, with the help of little smoke. \n\nI could have walked into that world if I had understood.  Little Smoke held the \"veil\" open for me.  \n\nA world of hidden treasures!  \n\nWhat a loss.\n\nNever saw little smoke again. I'd gotten used to his form over the last 25 years.

You can make faster progress with &amp;quot;Simple Chair Silence Technique&amp;quot; (in here) but it won&amp;#39;t do you any good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the last 23 years since Carlos died without teaching anyone, and I tried to help just 1 single person if at all possible, I lost 3 to the chair silence technique.  Another 2 to gazing, which is even faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put magic right in their face!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was with eyes closed or while staring at something like a fern leaf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they quit after a year or two of finally understanding what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are some &amp;quot;dead spots&amp;quot; in the path of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only do you have to wake people up to the fact that it&amp;#39;s all fake out there, but once you give them the real thing you have to get them over the &amp;quot;But there&amp;#39;s no attention in this variety!&amp;quot; hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They thought they wanted magic but  the truth was, they wanted attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So having magic, but no attention, they gave up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do opened eyes darkroom, it&amp;#39;s impressive enough that you might keep going, even when you get to a &amp;quot;dead spot&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, you&amp;#39;ll be doing amazing magic, which no one will believe.  Which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s so much work, you want to slack off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With darkroom there&amp;#39;s a steady of progression of cool things  just out of reach, so people tend to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, if they can make it to the end of the J curve, I doubt anyone would quit after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, it&amp;#39;s very very very very hard to get rid of the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So people just pretend they&amp;#39;re successful, and since everyone does that you can get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even their famous &amp;quot;saints&amp;quot; are nearly totally clueless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For your own edification, Enlightenment is simply the absence of an internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you do darkroom, you reach enlightenment faster than by any other method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That understanding is universal on the web, if you find places with actual definitions of enlightenment, and not just hype of their own &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s Shinzen Young telling you that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just FYI so you never get the idea maybe it&amp;#39;s not worth all the effort to get silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s Shinzen with an inorganic being &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot; standing on his hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he makes fun of it, not realizing how far it can develop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1714&amp;amp;v=xF5V9r7_ZHI&amp;amp;t=25m40s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1714&amp;amp;v=xF5V9r7_ZHI&amp;amp;t=25m40s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made my own fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She taught me everything going on in here, and even lifted her little skirt to show me whether she was shaved down there, just because the thought crossed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what Shinzen does with his little drummer boy...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, they&amp;#39;re just &amp;quot;spirits&amp;quot; of the kind native americans learn to control.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/r4ei8v/where_do_i_start/hmkuxtr/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1638220311.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_r4ei8v", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hmki67m", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ReverendMage", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1638215196.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hmkfa3r", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5aekgkm9", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Ahh, my username??

Many who practice sorcery will come to remember repeated dreaming episodes from elementary school, where they had complicated ways to \"play\" inside dreams.\n\nChildren have the correct outlook.\n\nPerception is perception, and fun is fun.\n\nBut as adults, we've been so hazed and brainwashed, that the things we did as children would send us to the shrink, as adults.\n\nAny decent person would reject it all out of hand, and even do his best to put a stop to it if a loved one went down that road.\n\nBut in fact, sorcery is actually a way to escape the madhouse of modern society.\n\nModern society is a river of suffering and self-pity, held together by the idea that we all need each other, and family is all that matters.\n\nHow's that working out for  you?\n\nIf it's ok now it'll get worse and worse.  That myth just doesn't hold up over time.\n\nBut it takes 60 years to figure out you were tricked. And by then, all you can do is help trick the next generation and hope \"God\" has a better plan for after you die.\n\nIf you take everything known to man, including God and Heaven, sorcery is outside the pearly gates.\n\nIt exists in what is known to the Jews as \u201couter darkness\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cDark Sea of Awareness\u201d.\n\nAs it turns out, there are more things in that dark sea, than there are in the known world.\n\nOur perception of reality is a tiny bubble on a nearly infinite universe.\n\nBut Catholics who want to study sorcery, fear not.\n\nWe fall under the \u201cloophole\u201d.\n\nThe loophole is a constant theme in the bible.\n\nIf God can be proven wrong, the whole deal is off. A new deal has to be struck.\n\nWhat you see in that picture is a violation of, \u201cBehold, I foretold you all things.\u201d\n\nSo, we\u2019re free to explore.\n\nUnfortunately, if you want to explore further than just a little, you need the dark energy of inorganic beings.\n\nTo quote don Juan,\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nYou are ready then for one final statement about that world \\[*the inorganic beings realm*\\]. The most dreadful statement I can make,\" he said, and tried smile but did not quite make it.\n\nDon Juan searched in my eyes, I suppose for a glimmer of agreement or comprehension. He was silent for a moment.\n\n\u201cThe energy necessary to move the assemblage points of sorcerers comes from the realm of inorganic beings,\" he said, as if he were hurrying to get it over with.\n\nMy heart nearly stopped. I felt a vertigo and had to stomp my feet on the ground not to faint.\n\n\"This is the truth,\" don Juan went on, \"and the legacy of the old sorcerers to us. They have us pinned down to this day.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMyself, I\u2019m not sure what all the commotion is about.\n\nInorganic beings are fun!\n\nTerrifying yes.\n\nBut it turns out, they\u2019re very helpful.\n\n\u201cFairy\u201d, an entity I found and trained, is determined to help us restore magic to the world. She\u2019s out and about right now, using her location spell to find people who are practicing sincerely.\n\nShe started out of my own concern, which was showing up when we played at night.\n\nBut now, I suspect she\u2019ll go from person to person, like back in the old days when don Juan used Little Smoke to teach Carlos.\n\nYes, most of what happened in the early books was merely Little Smoke, and Devil\u2019s weed, the 2 allies of don Juan.\n\nDon Juan passed them to Carlos, and Carlos passed them to his private class.\n\nAs far as I know, I was the only one from private class who took advantage of the gift.\n\nBut I also found them too terrifying to call on, if I could avoid it.\n\nInstead, I found \u201cFairy\u201d, and taught her not to frighten people.\n\nAnd Cholita, a witch trained by Carlos, found Minx, also not all that scary.\n\nThere\u2019s some argument about their identity.\n\nI\u2019ve seen Fairy follow Cholita around during the day, and her daytime appearance is a golf ball sized puff of smoke.\n\nShe\u2019s literally \u201ca little smoke\u201d during the day.\n\nThat\u2019s not a universal appearance for an Ally.\n\n\"Fancy\", my new IOB, so named because of her tendency to wear fancy clothes and do costume changes constantly, is a larger cloud of smoke, taller than it is wide.\n\nHer companion is \"Bob\", so named because I sure wish he'd go away.\n\nBut he doesn't.  So, \"Bob's your Uncle\", and there's nothing that can be done about it.\n\nMinx forms a low hanging cloud of bluish smoke, wider than it is tall.\n\nWell, I shouldn't say blue. I haven't seen his cloud in sunlight. It could be white there, just like Fairy.\n\nThis picture shows the result of the first week of training Fancy to be useful.\n\nAfter just 3 days she brought me to her world, where I pushed and pulled a few times on the nearest friend of hers.\n\nI don't like to go into there any further than my elbow.\n\nThe result was, Fancy caused a bag of metal parts to explode in our warehouse, and I visually saw her heading in there just before and after the explosion.\n\nShe gained the ability to move physical objects.\n\nThat's written up in a post about Poltergeists.\n\nWe use their energy, but they can also use ours.\n\nAnd we both have fun!\n\nThat's the deal.\n\nBut I suspect, IOBs have \"realms\" they will not cross, without permission.\n\nMultiple realms.\n\nYou have to give permission at each one.\n\nThe result of me taking Fancy's \"ghost\" seriously, and not dismissing it as silly, which simply means, after seeing a cloud of smoke go into my warehouse, hearing the crashing of metal parts a while later, and then going to find what fell, was that Fancy felt she had permission to be more aggressive.\n\nA fellow office worker refused to go look around. He dismissed the crash sound as just something that randomly fell.\n\nI decided to see with my own eyes, and what I saw surprised even that office worker.\n\nWith \"permission\" to act in the waking world, Fancy began to either steal energy, or modify my own energy.\n\nEither way, I benefited.\n\nThat\u2019s probably how it is with inorganics.\n\nSome pluses, some negatives.\n\nIf anyone wants to avoid them, then just don\u2019t pay attention to them. Ignore their first appearances.\n\nNever give them permission.\n\nBut you\u2019ll have a very hard time with waking dreaming, without their help.\n\nYou might have to wait for group energetic mass.\n\nAnd you won't make it.  You'll give up.\n\nMyself, I wish you'd all find and train at least one IOB, to be used to help the group.\n\nAnd if anyone feels so inclined, I'd sure like to see ond that looks like Hello Kitty.\n\nYou can coax them into any form you like, although with Fancy, I haven't made any specific requests.\n\nShe sort of copied Fairy.\n\nWhen you view my pictures or those of Juann, keep in mind, we're not professional artists.\n\nWe grab images and paste them to make the picture.\n\nAnd some things are just not perfect.\n\nFancy has a consistent look, which is not present in those pictures.  She changes costumes, wears puffy clothes, her hair style changes, but generally she looks like, \"Fancy\".\n\nBob is transgender. I keep asking him to refrain from wearing a tuxedo, and to try to be feminine, but he's just an extra. Some kind of entity that Fancy likes to have around.\n\nCould even be a projection from Fancy herself.  IOBs can easily project 4 copies of themselves in various forms, as they did for the Buddha.\n\nThe energy coming from the hands did NOT look like electricity, as it does in my picture. \n\nIt was more like existing fibers of light in the air, mixed with echos of themselves which cancel out the total light. But when separated, you can see them clearly.\n\nThey don't radiate from the hands.  The hands make them glow.  They're closer to those \"Mission Impossible\" movie security laser beams, which are invisible if the air is clear. \n\nBut  they can be seen once you wave your hands around in there, and the beam hits your arm.  But the more  you get hit, the more the air fills with smoke, and all of the beams become visible in that area.\n\nEdited twice\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Fancy's Manipulations", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"6mqa5n56mng51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6mqa5n56mng51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eed713da3690b1f99ee4f3efd1e275fc9a782df3"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6mqa5n56mng51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d5b70e0d2a3d0876129052ca2ffb9b9a0fb430f"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6mqa5n56mng51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9cbd3c437b96b5f8f74fcc5ebddeba23b10dfa6"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6mqa5n56mng51.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fd203b1f9663f6aea0a3218bea6e133ad64da81"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6mqa5n56mng51.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87b5286979c8c6ce9c1e89f152dcc1e3956e77c7"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6mqa5n56mng51.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f79f1c14b905494a7bfc6e419a70338e33d0f8b"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/6mqa5n56mng51.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99703dd504a88dbddb34303e7c59badf55658af1"}, "id": "6mqa5n56mng51"}}, "name": "t3_i8ok0r", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/KIf1EIXdxAi-u-0tS6LV3y93xQAg_LF1P2dxz2VMAkE.jpg", "edited": 1597339545.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1597274051.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6mqa5n56mng51.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=99703dd504a88dbddb34303e7c59badf55658af1\"&gt;Fancy is very different from Fairy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery could be defined as the study of the delusional, the impossible, and everything rejected by any sane, rationally minded, decent  person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While studying those things, vague memories of terrors in the night during childhood will surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you even catch a glimpse of things that can\u2019t be described, but which were typical perceptions for you as an infant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The repetitious weirdness of fever visions can also come to awareness, reminding you how talented children are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Children are natural dreamers, since they don&amp;#39;t really know the difference between dreaming and waking.

I've seen them together in their most horrible forms, and so have Carlos and La Gorda.\n\nAt any rate, Fancy has, \"Bob\".\n\nHe's like a sidekick.\n\nI spent a lot of time last night trying to convince Fancy to help out in this subreddit, the same way Fairy has done.\n\nIt started with me purchasing a new high speed fan.\n\nIt was 106F yesterday.  Or for the metric system people, it was so hot you'd walk outside and say, \"Shit!  No way!  This can't be possible.\"\n\nI had the high speed fan hooked up, blasting me.\n\nIt was the only way to survive at night, since Cholita bans me from access to the air conditioning.\n\nI was sitting up in bed, in the dark, facing the fan while sitting on the edge of the bed, and playing with puffs of color.\n\nI felt a bit like Juann's last post where he mentioned being depressed because he'd lost his super powers.\n\nMine never go away, but they can be limited to something I'm not currently interested in.\n\nI heard a frightening spring sound. Like a \"boing\" you might produce electronically on a radio talk show, to make a joke.\n\nIt was a \"perfect\" sound.\n\nI listened more to figure out where it had come from.\n\nAs best I could figure, the fan vibrated just the right way.\n\nIt was really blasting and vibrating. I felt like I was in a wind tunnel. But it was still 95F, even in the evening.  I had to sit right there, to keep from dripping in sweat.\n\nThe \"boing\" sound had increased the brightness of the purple blobs I found.  No surprise, I was still feeling the tingle of fear from that sound.\n\nI heard a coyote call.\n\nIt give me a chill up my spine.\n\nI realized what was happening.  It was IOB sounds!\n\nI rarely ever hear those.\n\nFancy had made an adjustment to my energy body a few days earlier, using those pitchers and pillows.\n\nI thought maybe that was the reason.\n\nShe'd also made it easier for me to see filaments of energy.\n\nOr perhaps, it was simply Fancy herself.  Maybe she's noisy.\n\nI played with Fancy for the rest of the evening, until she trapped me in an abstract dream the same way you see in the pictures above.\n\nI was lucid, and it was a stable dream.\n\nBut I was worried about a list.  The list contained one item that was particularly important.\n\nIt was a flat tube around 3 feet high, with a white V marked on the side to identify it.  It was made from grey material, possibly sheet metal or plastic.\n\nI floated in and out of watching dreaming scenes, but every 5 or 10 minutes I felt compelled to go check my list, and make sure the item was safely in place.\n\nIt reminded me of the Eagle's command to take an inventory.\n\nAnyone practicing Zuleica's brand of darkness gazing will become familiar with that command from the eagle.\n\nIt forces you to stop, and look inside.\n\nIf you have a noisy internal dialogue, you'll find one of the things that makes it run, take an inventory of that, and get lost in the resulting internal dialogue.\n\nSeveral minutes later you'll realize you messed up, and started fantasizing.  And the colors are all dim now.\n\nBut once you get good at silence, you'll be stopped, look, ignore what you see, and return to silence.\n\nIt seems that fancy can put a \"list\" in your mind, and you end up focusing on that, when you take an inventory.\n\nIt's a \"pure\" thought.

I&amp;#39;ve seen them together in their most horrible forms, and so have Carlos and La Gorda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At any rate, Fancy has, &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s like a sidekick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time last night trying to convince Fancy to help out in this subreddit, the same way Fairy has done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It started with me purchasing a new high speed fan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was 106F yesterday.  Or for the metric system people, it was so hot you&amp;#39;d walk outside and say, &amp;quot;Shit!  No way!  This can&amp;#39;t be possible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the high speed fan hooked up, blasting me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the only way to survive at night, since Cholita bans me from access to the air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was sitting up in bed, in the dark, facing the fan while sitting on the edge of the bed, and playing with puffs of color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt a bit like Juann&amp;#39;s last post where he mentioned being depressed because he&amp;#39;d lost his super powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mine never go away, but they can be limited to something I&amp;#39;m not currently interested in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard a frightening spring sound. Like a &amp;quot;boing&amp;quot; you might produce electronically on a radio talk show, to make a joke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I listened more to figure out where it had come from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As best I could figure, the fan vibrated just the right way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was really blasting and vibrating. I felt like I was in a wind tunnel. But it was still 95F, even in the evening.  I had to sit right there, to keep from dripping in sweat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;boing&amp;quot; sound had increased the brightness of the purple blobs I found.  No surprise, I was still feeling the tingle of fear from that sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard a coyote call.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It give me a chill up my spine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized what was happening.  It was IOB sounds!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rarely ever hear those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy had made an adjustment to my energy body a few days earlier, using those pitchers and pillows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought maybe that was the reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;d also made it easier for me to see filaments of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps, it was simply Fancy herself.  Maybe she&amp;#39;s noisy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I played with Fancy for the rest of the evening, until she trapped me in an abstract dream the same way you see in the pictures above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was lucid, and it was a stable dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was worried about a list.  The list contained one item that was particularly important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a flat tube around 3 feet high, with a white V marked on the side to identify it.  It was made from grey material, possibly sheet metal or plastic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I floated in and out of watching dreaming scenes, but every 5 or 10 minutes I felt compelled to go check my list, and make sure the item was safely in place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It reminded me of the Eagle&amp;#39;s command to take an inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone practicing Zuleica&amp;#39;s brand of darkness gazing will become familiar with that command from the eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It forces you to stop, and look inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a noisy internal dialogue, you&amp;#39;ll find one of the things that makes it run, take an inventory of that, and get lost in the resulting internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several minutes later you&amp;#39;ll realize you messed up, and started fantasizing.  And the colors are all dim now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you get good at silence, you&amp;#39;ll be stopped, look, ignore what you see, and return to silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems that fancy can put a &amp;quot;list&amp;quot; in your mind, and you end up focusing on that, when you take an inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; thought. Like those jars. Or those pillows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very simple objects, easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re in lucid dreaming, you get the command to take an inventory, and your attention is pulled onto those objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Implanted by Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose she hangs out and absorbs some form of energy, given off by holding you there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which might sound sinister.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, it means Fancy has a use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To create lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just have to figure out how to make use of her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect she&amp;#39;s a little more &amp;quot;dangerous&amp;quot; than Fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy was passed to use directly from don Juan, assuming she&amp;#39;s really little smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d have to think the lineage would select it&amp;#39;s IOBs for their usefulness and safety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Fancy is outside that lineage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And perhaps a little too concerned with her makeup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s usually a warning sign

You don't look at the fine details when you're only pretending.  You just make those up!  Better book deal potential.\n\nOr as I learned last week, it's when you \"have something at stake\", that the details start to seem important.\n\nMy Schedule K form rejected by the IRS  taught me, whether stuff is \"all at stake\" or not, determines how much you have to pay.  You have to check that box!\n\nCarlos used to do that.   Include \"topical\" stuff from what was going on at the time.  Maybe to see who was awake during a lecture.\n\nHe even had us go to an emergency class either on Christmas day, or the day before.  His very class schedule got influenced by \"current events\".  Had to hold that class in a garage some mysterious inner circle person had available.  Maybe Bruce...\n\nAnyone who actually studies in this subreddit, instead of lingering and trying to find an excuse to post and get attention, will have realized that we're trying to \"master intent\".\n\nNot, \"save the subreddit\".   Or add your own, \"valuable wisdom\" perhaps derived from other \"secret lineages\".\n\nThat's not an attempt to master intent. It's an attempt to get away with masturbating in public.\n\nA perversion of reality.\n\nWhen I saw this section in the writings of Carlos, trying to find what he said about somersaults into the inconceivable, I was surprised to see it imply that \"intent\" was not the same group of emanations as \"the dark sea\".\n\nWe already know that the word \"intent\" has different uses.  Like the president of the USA can also be a father, a husband, the owner of a cute \"first dog\", and any other number of things.\n\nI thought that if \"intent\" had some other roles, they'd be more like that.  Just a different point of view.\n\nBut I'm not so sure after reading this.\n\nRemember that Carlos was ultra careful to be \"precise\" in his choice of words.  A tiny mistake could lead to horrible decisions in his students.\n\nHere's the quote, with my comments in brackets like this *\\[dan's butt in stuff\\].*  The rest was written by Carlos.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nAccording to the shamans' logic, in the case of human beings, the system of interpreting sensorial data is their cognition. They maintain that human cognition can be temporarily interrupted, since it is merely a taxonomical system, in which responses have been classified along with the interpretation of sensory data. When this interruption occurs, sorcerers claim that energy can be perceived directly as it flows in the universe. Sorcerers describe perceiving energy directly as having the effect of seeing it with the eyes, although the eyes are only minimally involved.\n\n*\\[You realize this when you make it to the midpoint between green and red on the J curve, and the air in the room is no longer just blackness.\\]*\n\nTo perceive energy directly allowed the sorcerers of don Juan's lineage to see human beings as conglomerates of energy fields that have the appearance of luminous balls. *\\[likely not until full on SK can you see this\\]*   Observing human beings in such a fashion allowed those shamans to draw extraordinary energetic conclusions. They noticed that each of those luminous balls is individually connected to an energetic mass of inconceivable proportions that exists in the universe; a mass which they called the dark sea of awareness. They observed that each individual ball is attached to the dark sea of awareness at a point that is even more brilliant than the luminous ball itself. Those shamans called that point of juncture the assemblage point, because they observed that it is at that spot that perception takes place. The flux of energy at large is turned, on that point, into sensorial data, and those data are then interpreted as the world that surrounds us.\n\n*\\[not at all how I pictured it\\]*\n\nWhen I asked don Juan to explain to me how this process of turning the flux of energy into sensory data occurred, he replied that the only thing shamans know about this is that the immense mass of energy called the dark sea of awareness supplies human beings with whatever is necessary to elicit this transformation of energy into sensory data, and that such a process could not possibly ever be deciphered because of the vastness of that original source.\n\n*\\[Notice that a fraud guru type (they all are) would say he has the answer to this, as they always do. Thus,  the witches getting angry when treated as gurus who have all the answers.  What they were really being treated as, is frauds.  When I get asked something really stupid, the truth is the person asking believes I'm making stuff up, because they go all over the place reading nonsense, and can't tell it from the real thing.\\]*\n\nWhat the shamans of ancient Mexico found out when they focused their seeing on the dark sea of awareness was the revelation that the entire cosmos is made of luminous filaments that extend themselves infinitely. Shamans describe them as luminous filaments that go every which way without ever touching one another. They saw that they are individual filaments, and yet, they are grouped in inconceivably enormous masses.\n\nAnother of such masses of filaments, besides the dark sea of awareness which the shamans observed and liked because of its vibration, was something they called intent, and the act of individual shamans focusing their attention on such a mass, they called intending. They saw that the entire universe was a universe of intent, and intent, for them, was the equivalent of intelligence. The universe, therefore, was, for them, a universe of supreme intelligence. Their conclusion, which became part of their cognitive world, was that vibratory energy, aware of itself, was intelligent in the extreme. They saw that the mass of intent in the cosmos was responsible for all the possible mutations, all the possible variations which happened in the universe, not because of arbitrary, blind circumstances, but because of the intending done by the vibratory energy, at the level of the flux of energy itself.\n\nDon Juan pointed out that in the world of everyday life, human beings make use of intent and intending in the manner in which they interpret the world. Don Juan, for instance, alerted me to the fact that my daily world was not ruled by my perception, but by the interpretation of my perception. He gave as an example the concept of university, which at that time was a concept of supreme importance to me. He said that university was not something I could perceive with my senses, because neither my sight nor my hearing, nor my sense of taste, nor my tactile or olfactory senses, gave me any clue about university. University happened only in my intending, and in order to construct it there, I had to make use of everything I knew as a civilized person, in a conscious or subliminal way.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Realty Check Inspirational Quote", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"oryw25aycqs81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oryw25aycqs81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3cb9465a8e7a3abede34533cfa932b708e295a4"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oryw25aycqs81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0a7443dfd03b882fabe3231783d206107cb2e80"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oryw25aycqs81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82c6c08c4e404166626a3f1dc784fa733244ef76"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oryw25aycqs81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d202da453b7bc076d5807f421bd03101af6193b"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oryw25aycqs81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55d041ccf79d3eda8ea9673f9bcdaa3db81bc851"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oryw25aycqs81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5afe7ec0ffae835052eb54398d76c55ddc78d5b7"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oryw25aycqs81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=175f92f2a3471d90648df2d15f7cceb981edb5e4"}, "id": "oryw25aycqs81"}}, "name": "t3_u0jjoi", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/sOk4Rrqb4uDjiYa7-Xn2jmr9Pe_So2vxjfH2_iclQHU.jpg", "edited": 1649608997.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1649603346.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oryw25aycqs81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=175f92f2a3471d90648df2d15f7cceb981edb5e4\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/oryw25aycqs81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=175f92f2a3471d90648df2d15f7cceb981edb5e4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m searching for &amp;quot;somersault&amp;quot; in the books, and found this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one would have noticed it much in the past, because everyone was pretending.

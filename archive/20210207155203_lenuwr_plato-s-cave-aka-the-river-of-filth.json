If he were told that what he is seeing is real instead of the other version of reality he sees on the wall, he would not believe it. In his pain, Plato continues, the freed prisoner would turn away and run back to what he is accustomed to (that is, the shadows of the carried objects). He writes &amp;quot;... it would hurt his eyes, and he would escape by turning away to the things which he was able to look at, and these he would believe to be clearer than what was being shown to him...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...Plato continues, saying that the (successfully) freed prisoner would think that the world outside the cave was superior to the world he experienced in the cave and attempt to share this with the prisoners remaining in the cave attempting to bring them onto the journey he had just endured; &amp;quot;he would bless himself for the change, and pity [the other prisoners]&amp;quot; and would want to bring his fellow cave dwellers out of the cave and into the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The returning prisoner, whose eyes have become accustomed to the sunlight, would be blind when he re-enters the cave, just as he was when he was first exposed to the sun. The prisoners, according to Plato, would infer from the returning man&amp;#39;s blindness that the journey out of the cave had harmed him and that they should not undertake a similar journey. Plato concludes that the prisoners, if they were able, would therefore reach out and kill anyone who attempted to drag them out of the cave.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lenuwr/platos_cave_aka_the_river_of_filth/gmg0yao/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1612709818.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_lenuwr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gn1v0y8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1613132554.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_lenuwr", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Looking for a place to put this so it will at least pop up in a search, here is as good a place as any.\n\nWhen someone on this subreddit appears to be digging into you in what could be construed by some as a personal attack, it is usually* for the individual's long term benefit, to bring out any misc. mental inventory, misunderstandings and conflicting explanations they may have accumulated that could inhibit progress in this system...if they choose to continue pursuing it.\n\nTry your best to not lose your head (blow your top) or try to \"kill\" them like the denizens in Plato's Cave.\n\n*I say usually because every once and a while someone wanders in with the express purpose to denigrate and instigate, and overt grilling is the fastest way to draw that out and force their true colors to the surface, so they can be sent on their way.", "edited": 1613132913.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gn1v0y8", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for a place to put this so it will at least pop up in a search, here is as good a place as any.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When someone on this subreddit appears to be digging into you in what could be construed by some as a personal attack, it is usually* for the individual&amp;#39;s long term benefit, to bring out any misc. mental inventory, misunderstandings and conflicting explanations they may have accumulated that could inhibit progress in this system...if they choose to continue pursuing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try your best to not lose your head (blow your top) or try to &amp;quot;kill&amp;quot; them like the denizens in Plato&amp;#39;s Cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*I say usually because every once and a while someone wanders in with the express purpose to denigrate and instigate, and overt grilling is the fastest way to draw that out and force their true colors to the surface, so they can be sent on their way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lenuwr/platos_cave_aka_the_river_of_filth/gn1v0y8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1613132554.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_lenuwr", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}]

Gurus are all rotten to the core.](https://preview.redd.it/lg6idzi59mu71.jpg?width=565&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e00d6247ba854f57d8ef13581671398ebc01941c)\n\nI've had a rough time in subreddit private chat from the very start.  You've seen the bad players in public posts here.  They do the same in private chat, except they're all \"good guys\" in there.\n\nAnd the \"But I'm a good guy\" type of bad players are some of the worst.  They've done the most damage to the Castaneda community over the years, with their extremely bad advice to others.\n\nFor instance, a bad player with the 3 largest social media platforms, telling people for the last 20 years that \"Carlos went bad\", \"Don Juan taught me new tensegrity moves in dreaming\", and the dreaming emissary told him it was all real.  And you know the dreaming emissary can't lie.\n\nThat's a wanna-be guru, who will kill to get what he wants.  But he pretends to be a \"good guy\", so he can throw a huge tantrum if anyone calls him out.\n\nBut why would anyone want to be a guru, if they had an interest in sorcery?\n\nThey wouldn't.  The losses from becoming a guru are impossible to estimate.  You might even argue that guruhood is fatal to a real sorcerer.\n\nCould be what killed Carlos.\n\nWhich tells you what interests gurus.  Not magic, that's for sure.\n\nAnd it's not expansion of consciousness.  There's not a single guru on the earth who has even a tiny inkling of the assemblage point, and how to move it.\n\nTony Lama, the only double being Carlos ever found, decided to become a guru instead of going with Carlos.  I suspect if you look him up these days, he can't even do what beginners in here do.  And won't believe what advanced practitioners can do.  He gets to the green line on the J curve with his meditation, and then he gets lots of respect and attention.\n\nEven a double being who takes the guru path gets nowhere.\n\nThey may reach the basic level of enlightenment. Occasionally.\n\nBut that's been hyped up to the extreme.  Darkroom gazers get to taste several layers of eastern \"enlightenment\",  by anyone's legitimate definition on the web.  With the westernization of Asian mysticism, we now have some honest Buddhists out there.  And they'll tell you, enlightenment is nothing other than getting rid of the internal dialogue.\n\nWe go so much further than that!  We untangle the very deepest attachments and associations with this view of reality, and change to others where being  human makes no sense at all.\n\nIn the end, \"enlightenment\" is not even on the list of  things sorcerers are trying to pursue.\n\nYou could duplicate most of that with a visit to the neighborhood drug dealer.\n\nLast night I was suffering from the traces of private chat, where I was begged, blackmailed, threatened, admired for nothing,  and all in the same day.\n\nI couldn't figure out what to do about it.\n\nSome of the private chatters aren't all that bad, and it seems to encourage some on the fence to work harder. But in the long run, those don't continue.  They need someone else's energy or they won't practice.\n\nBut I do get some juicy gossip and good spying from private chat. It has occasional rewards.\n\nLast night I spent 2 hours in the darkroom moving my assemblage point into the orange zone, emphasizing Tensegrity as the vehicle.  But when I got to the orange zone, I was seeing something I can't now describe.  It was some aspect of *intent* which had become visual. Keeping it in sight required watching it continuously in PERFECT silence.\n\nIt's a tall order.  I started to run out of energy, and  I finally lay on my side to watch it that way, and naturally slipped into dreaming.\n\nYou go straight into dreaming every time if you reach the orange zone, and *see* energy.\n\nSomeone was waiting for me in there, but it was at a distant position of the orange zone, and entering into dreaming further shifted my assemblage point sideways.\n\nI was in to \"completely forgot it all\" territory, the way don Juan had taught Carlos in secret all those years, by pushing his assemblage point too far for him to recall it.\n\nWe get to experience that also.\n\nYou might think \"That's really cool, now you can finish 4 gates dreaming!\"\n\nAssuming you could back off a bit, and remember it later.\n\nActually, by then you have already brought the double into the real world, had visits from inorganic beings, visited their world, and learned from the dreaming emissary.\n\nAnd you have all the dark energy you need. That's the reason for 4 gates dreaming.  To gain dark energy so you can move the assemblage point, the way sorcerers do.\n\nAs for going to sleep inside a dream, a way to stabilize lucid dreaming, and find even deeper worlds, you do all that fully awake, a dozen of times each night. Even the 3rd gate is blown open by darkroom gazing.\n\nOnce you get to the deep orange zone on the J curve, four gates dreaming goals are already finished.\n\nWithout even having to find your hands.\n\nAnd rather than one cool dream per month, which is a \"good achievement\" for lucid dreamers, you do hours and hours of waking dreaming each night.\n\nFour gates dreaming is like restaurant crackers.  The ones that come for free with the chili.\n\nIf you're starving out in the mountains with no way to get food soon, and you accidentally left a stale pack of restaurant crackers in the glove compartment of your car, I can assure you those will be the BEST crackers you ever ate in your life.\n\nYou'll make up your mind then and there to track down that brand and buy a huge box of them.\n\nUntil you get down from the mountain, see all the amazing restaurants, and sit yourself down at an all you can eat buffet.\n\nThen you'll be wondering what madness took you over.\n\nThat's 4 gates dreaming.  A stale pack of crackers.\n\nWaking dreaming is the all you can eat buffet.  And yes, they do have crackers in that buffet.\n\nI tried to explain to a friend, how amazing those crackers were up on the mountain.\n\nI got the same blank expression lucid dreamers get, when they try to share their \"amazing\" experiences.\n\nI was startled out of that temporary rest period last night where I was laying on my side during darkroom gazing watching *intent*,  and had entered half waking dreaming, by Cholita banging on something.\n\nI was surprised.\n\nCholita found someone else to protect her.  Most of my efforts lately are trying to figure out who it could be.\n\nHad she come home in the middle of the night to trade out some clothes?\n\nShe has a lot of stuff still in my home.\n\nShe made a few more noises inside the house  moving things, closing doors, but it was all very odd sounds.\n\nThey were \"Flat\".  There was no \"follow up\" to the sound.   Each stood on its own.  For example, if a door is kicked shut, there ought to be steps after that.  Especially with the echo chamber of oak floors and no carpeting.\n\nI sat up and turned to face the direction of the sounds, but it was absolutely silent in my house.\n\nI finally suspected her IOB \"Minx\" could be behind it.  So I got up, went outside my darkroom as quietly as possible, and checked the drive way.\n\nCholita's car was not there.\n\nI resumed darkroom, to find I was already in the orange zone.    The whitish light was everywhere, and I even had a phantom copy of my room all around me.\n\nI gazed north to see if Cholita's \"corridor\" was available, but it was still closed. She had created that in order to rescue me from being stuck in the red zone.  She cut a \"shortcut\" across the side.\n\nThen I *saw*.\n\nThe whitish light you can see on surfaces, which forms phantom copies of your house or room,  can also produce floating dream visions.\n\nLike on the cover of Wheel of Time.\n\nWhen it turns into *seeing*, instead of being a floating dream, your silence is so deep there's no difference between where you are, and what's inside the dream.   The dream plays, absent \"self\".  Absent audience even.\n\nI suspect it's our natural state.  To be free of \"ME\".\n\nME is a secondary layer on what really is happening at a given time. It's like an \"insurance policy\", combined with a policeman.  To make sure that YOU get all you deserve.\n\nAs such, it doesn't allow the abstract.  Or even things which have no cause to the effect.\n\nME is **all** about cause and effect.  It blinds you to magic.\n\nThe first scene I *saw* showed me how to form an assemblage point shortcut from the green line to the purple zone at the end of the J curve.\n\nThe assemblage point \"rolls\" along the back and side, directly from just below the left shoulder blade, to the final spit below the second attention's assemblage point in the front.\n\nI also *saw* that Carlos had given us a pass that does that.  It included a roll of the shoulder.  You were literally \"rolling\" the assemblage point, like it was a magnetic ball stuck to your back. You couldn't get it to leave the body, but you could force it to move sideways and down.\n\nI realized, some of his passes are tricky ways to move the assemblage point outside the J curve!\n\nDon Juan had told Carlos, the assemblage point could move ANYWHERE on the outside of the luminous egg.\n\nBut Carlos had only shown  us how to move it, while remaining inside the \"band of man\".\n\nSome Tensegrity movements seem designed to move it \"off band\".\n\nBut you have to be very flexible to detect it.  Your assemblage point has to at least be able to move to the far end of the orange zone, or it's too \"sticky\" to notice the effects of those passes.\n\nI felt a trace amount of bother from private chat madness during that day.\n\nIt was interfering with my seeing.\n\nIt was not enough to constitute a thought, but in a silent condition you can notice even the tiniest left over friction.\n\nThat caused me to *see* a vision of how recapitulation fixes that.\n\nI did what it recommended.\n\nBut something was still wrong. I had damage that wasn't entirely from embedded emanations.\n\n\"You've been turned into a guru\", I  heard.\n\nA vision of a weird crazy man sitting on a throne appeared.  I could see the hatred in his eyes. Hatred for the fools who didn't realize, he wasn't what they believed.  His smile at them was like poison, because he knew their fate would also not be good.\n\nI had the reaction, \"I'm not that.\"\n\nThe added reaction was enough to reskim the lines in the whitish light, and I had a vision of Carlos suffering with inner circle people problems.\n\nThey all WANTED something from him.  And believed he OWED it to them.  But they knew they had to kowtow out of \"respect\".\n\nIn other words, manipulate and blackmail him with social thinking.  Use all they knew about how to manipulate people, on him.\n\nI realized, the guru thing is more complicated than I understood.\n\nThat was enough to reskim the emanations.\n\nI was \"free skimming\".\n\nThat's one method of *seeing*.\n\nYou glance around in the darkness, which at that point is filled with whitish light, looking for the next \"frame\".\n\nThe next answer, floating in a mini dream.\n\nYour reaction to the previous \"answer\" causes reskimming.\n\nYou get a new \"frame\".  Or scene.  As you *see*, you tend to turn your head and look around.  That lets you control the \"direction\" the *seeing* takes you.\n\nIn that manner, you \"navigate\" the floating dreams and find the answer you need.\n\nIn contrast, other methods of seeing, of which we got examples in the books, require an outside force to do the reskimming for you.  \n\nSuch as Little Smoke pretending to be a moth, blowing moth dust your direction.\n\nBut in the type you do yourself by moving your gaze, if you have the goal to find the answer you will have messed it up.\n\nThe reskimming will include the desired to find your goal.\n\nAnd you'll get something else.  Something too complicated to even understand.\n\nIt's why no one can *see*.  The *seeing* is there, but they've buried it with greed and grief.\n\nYou almost have to be unaware of the process in order to let it flow and provide an answer you can comprehend.\n\nBut I had \"dead weight\" in my mind.  Unnecessary interactions with needy people in private chat, left their \"wishes\" in my thinking.\n\nNone of which was anything I could do for them.\n\nI tried to identify each one, hoping I could remove it.\n\nBut instead, I reskimmed a \"presentation\" on how people get transformed into gurus by needy followers.\n\nOne was a picture of two people counting money at some small card table event, based on having been closest to the Guru.  They weren't teaching anyone anything.  They were just cashing in on having been a groupie.\n\nThe Russians like to fly people like that over for a visit, so they can report how, \"Carlos went bad\".\n\nIt helps feed their \"Castaneda replacement\" industry of \"impeccable\" angry bullies.\n\nAnother was a lonely older woman no one could stand to be around, who had pressured followers into a little group she could always visit for friendship, based on manipulating the guru into saying something good about her in public.\n\nCarlos was ever aware of that motivation, and used to \"toss cookies\" to inner circle people who seemed to need it.\n\nEllis in particular was recipient of a whole box of cookies, over the years I watched her.\n\nOne \"seeing vision\" was a man who wanted to pretend his magic, and needed the guru to complement his \"technique\".\n\nA technique he'd come up with.  Pointless really, but he forced the guru to say something good about it, or have to dress him down in public.\n\nThat often happened in private classes.  Not only did men try to get Carlos to approve of their \"technical understanding\", but the Europeans even tried to engage him in conversations about \"deconstruction\" and such, as if sorcery were nothing more than an intellectual pursuit.\n\nOnly now am I even starting to understand how horrible that must have been for Carlos.  He always managed a painful, polite smile when the Europeans tried to \"out understand\" him.\n\nThe horrors I was *seeing*,  were endless.\n\nIt was a \"Guru Ecosystem\".  Rich and complex, but every part still a piece of the \"River of Filth\".\n\nI could feel the weight of guruhood on the ability to move the assemblage point.\n\nAt the distant end of the orange zone, even the tiniest \"feeling\" in your consciousness creates entire worlds you can step into.\n\nThe goal of sorcerers is to be empty of everything.  To be like a hollow tube to infinity.\n\nAnd THEN, to take a look around and discover the \"real\" world.\n\nThe one behind the facades.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Horrors of Guruhood", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"lg6idzi59mu71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lg6idzi59mu71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=282d05116fcb111475f7a0a3f5d22ce7d8b2ba56"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lg6idzi59mu71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1cfde3cc88b747a3c81bd7b7777e9ee6297d8f3"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lg6idzi59mu71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4143222532feba1ee8b9dfa9c13de5575e40a485"}], "s": {"y": 424, "x": 565, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/lg6idzi59mu71.jpg?width=565&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e00d6247ba854f57d8ef13581671398ebc01941c"}, "id": "lg6idzi59mu71"}}, "name": "t3_qc3ctr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/MZJaJvaDgBx6Y6rgWYr4Y2A2fK0rBohzj-BH-aJvXq8.jpg", "edited": 1634751264.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1634743427.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lg6idzi59mu71.jpg?width=565&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e00d6247ba854f57d8ef13581671398ebc01941c\"&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t matter if they wear a robe of go casual.

She cut a &amp;quot;shortcut&amp;quot; across the side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whitish light you can see on surfaces, which forms phantom copies of your house or room,  can also produce floating dream visions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like on the cover of Wheel of Time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it turns into &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;, instead of being a floating dream, your silence is so deep there&amp;#39;s no difference between where you are, and what&amp;#39;s inside the dream.   The dream plays, absent &amp;quot;self&amp;quot;.  Absent audience even.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect it&amp;#39;s our natural state.  To be free of &amp;quot;ME&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ME is a secondary layer on what really is happening at a given time. It&amp;#39;s like an &amp;quot;insurance policy&amp;quot;, combined with a policeman.  To make sure that YOU get all you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As such, it doesn&amp;#39;t allow the abstract.  Or even things which have no cause to the effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ME is &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; about cause and effect.  It blinds you to magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first scene I &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; showed me how to form an assemblage point shortcut from the green line to the purple zone at the end of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The assemblage point &amp;quot;rolls&amp;quot; along the back and side, directly from just below the left shoulder blade, to the final spit below the second attention&amp;#39;s assemblage point in the front.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; that Carlos had given us a pass that does that.  It included a roll of the shoulder.  You were literally &amp;quot;rolling&amp;quot; the assemblage point, like it was a magnetic ball stuck to your back. You couldn&amp;#39;t get it to leave the body, but you could force it to move sideways and down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, some of his passes are tricky ways to move the assemblage point outside the J curve!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan had told Carlos, the assemblage point could move ANYWHERE on the outside of the luminous egg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos had only shown  us how to move it, while remaining inside the &amp;quot;band of man&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some Tensegrity movements seem designed to move it &amp;quot;off band&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to be very flexible to detect it.  Your assemblage point has to at least be able to move to the far end of the orange zone, or it&amp;#39;s too &amp;quot;sticky&amp;quot; to notice the effects of those passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt a trace amount of bother from private chat madness during that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was interfering with my seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was not enough to constitute a thought, but in a silent condition you can notice even the tiniest left over friction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That caused me to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; a vision of how recapitulation fixes that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did what it recommended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But something was still wrong. I had damage that wasn&amp;#39;t entirely from embedded emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve been turned into a guru&amp;quot;, I  heard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A vision of a weird crazy man sitting on a throne appeared.  I could see the hatred in his eyes. Hatred for the fools who didn&amp;#39;t realize, he wasn&amp;#39;t what they believed.  His smile at them was like poison, because he knew their fate would also not be good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the reaction, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The added reaction was enough to reskim the lines in the whitish light, and I had a vision of Carlos suffering with inner circle people problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They all WANTED something from him.  And believed he OWED it to them.  But they knew they had to kowtow out of &amp;quot;respect&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, manipulate and blackmail him with social thinking.  Use all they knew about how to manipulate people, on him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, the guru thing is more complicated than I understood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was enough to reskim the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was &amp;quot;free skimming&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s one method of &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You glance around in the darkness, which at that point is filled with whitish light, looking for the next &amp;quot;frame&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next answer, floating in a mini dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your reaction to the previous &amp;quot;answer&amp;quot; causes reskimming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get a new &amp;quot;frame&amp;quot;.  Or scene.  As you &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;, you tend to turn your head and look around.  That lets you control the &amp;quot;direction&amp;quot; the &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; takes you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that manner, you &amp;quot;navigate&amp;quot; the floating dreams and find the answer you need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In contrast, other methods of seeing, of which we got examples in the books, require an outside force to do the reskimming for you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as Little Smoke pretending to be a moth, blowing moth dust your direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in the type you do yourself by moving your gaze, if you have the goal to find the answer you will have messed it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reskimming will include the desired to find your goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll get something else.  Something too complicated to even understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why no one can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;.  The &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; is there, but they&amp;#39;ve buried it with greed and grief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You almost have to be unaware of the process in order to let it flow and provide an answer you can comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I had &amp;quot;dead weight&amp;quot; in my mind.  Unnecessary interactions with needy people in private chat, left their &amp;quot;wishes&amp;quot; in my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of which was anything I could do for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to identify each one, hoping I could remove it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But instead, I reskimmed a &amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot; on how people get transformed into gurus by needy followers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One was a picture of two people counting money at some small card table event, based on having been closest to the Guru.  They weren&amp;#39;t teaching anyone anything.  They were just cashing in on having been a groupie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Russians like to fly people like that over for a visit, so they can report how, &amp;quot;Carlos went bad&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It helps feed their &amp;quot;Castaneda replacement&amp;quot; industry of &amp;quot;impeccable&amp;quot; angry bullies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another was a lonely older woman no one could stand to be around, who had pressured followers into a little group she could always visit for friendship, based on manipulating the guru into saying something good about her in public.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was ever aware of that motivation, and used to &amp;quot;toss cookies&amp;quot; to inner circle people who seemed to need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ellis in particular was recipient of a whole box of cookies, over the years I watched her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One &amp;quot;seeing vision&amp;quot; was a man who wanted to pretend his magic, and needed the guru to complement his &amp;quot;technique&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A technique he&amp;#39;d come up with.  Pointless really, but he forced the guru to say something good about it, or have to dress him down in public.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That often happened in private classes.  Not only did men try to get Carlos to approve of their &amp;quot;technical understanding&amp;quot;, but the Europeans even tried to engage him in conversations about &amp;quot;deconstruction&amp;quot; and such, as if sorcery were nothing more than an intellectual pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only now am I even starting to understand how horrible that must have been for Carlos.  He always managed a painful, polite smile when the Europeans tried to &amp;quot;out understand&amp;quot; him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The horrors I was &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;,  were endless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a &amp;quot;Guru Ecosystem&amp;quot;.  Rich and complex, but every part still a piece of the &amp;quot;River of Filth&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could feel the weight of guruhood on the ability to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the distant end of the orange zone, even the tiniest &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; in your consciousness creates entire worlds you can step into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goal of sorcerers is to be empty of everything.  To be like a hollow tube to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And THEN, to take a look around and discover the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one behind the facades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "qc3ctr", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 14, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qc3ctr/the_horrors_of_guruhood/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/qc3ctr/the_horrors_of_guruhood/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1634743427.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hhdzmsd", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "dunemi", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1634752194.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_qc3ctr", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_6upmf", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Great post.

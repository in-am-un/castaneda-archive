That word you were looking at becomes meaningless, seeming to submerge into some black bubbling liquid with \"randomness\" as it's quality.\n\nAnd you are generally surrounded by stuff that has no boundaries because there's no internal dialogue to define them.\n\nNothing has any meaning.\n\nAnd you realize a very important truth, which is good to remember if you end up teaching.\n\nThe world DOES NOT EXIST without the internal dialogue.\n\nIf you stop it, the world stops.\n\nIt can't possibly happen any other way.

Those form the majority of  rope.\n\nLater of course, \"what it is\" will just be a cartoon image in your mind.  A memory of remembering it, in concrete form.\n\nThus, you can't \"know\" that.  How to stop the internal dialogue.\n\nYou just \"see it\", when you get close enough.\n\nNext time someone buzzes into this subreddit with sad tales about not being able to get rid of their internal dialogue, or not having one,  don't feel any pity for them.\n\nIt'll almost surely turn out they were punking you to get attention, and weren't putting in much effort at all to try to learn.\n\n\"Mommy....

Concern is what brings you back, when you blank out.  Or zone out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Concern is the rope holding us to this dock of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the emanations you suck back to yourself, during recapitulation.  Those form the majority of  rope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later of course, &amp;quot;what it is&amp;quot; will just be a cartoon image in your mind.  A memory of remembering it, in concrete form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, you can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; that.  How to stop the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just &amp;quot;see it&amp;quot;, when you get close enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time someone buzzes into this subreddit with sad tales about not being able to get rid of their internal dialogue, or not having one,  don&amp;#39;t feel any pity for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll almost surely turn out they were punking you to get attention, and weren&amp;#39;t putting in much effort at all to try to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mommy.... I can&amp;#39;t do this.  I tried and tried. It&amp;#39;s too hard for me.  Please help.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those ill never learn sorcery.  Might be good not to waste time on them at all, except some day there might be an exception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far I haven&amp;#39;t seen any real &amp;quot;victims&amp;quot; of not being able to remove their internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be surprised if any is ever found.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished":

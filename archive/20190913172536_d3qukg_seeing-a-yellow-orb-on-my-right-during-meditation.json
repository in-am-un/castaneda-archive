You brought a different image to mind, due to fantasizing, and your assemblage point shifted back to a position suitable for that image.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t, then keep in mind that\u2019s sort of the same issue as with flashy experiences.

And you can\u2019t figure out why.\n\nIt\u2019s likely because you used up the energy that was released, and which brought you to that new position of the assemblage point. And you aren\u2019t able to sustain that point without steady release of energy (as minor as it is), so the assemblage point returns to normal.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what you can do about that in meditation, but I ran into a similar effect last night and re-discovered that you have to keep interacting in new ways, if possible.\n\nI was trying to find my fairy, the low energy and kind of friendly inorganic being I\u2019d coaxed into staying around.

No expression, just stiff faces and shapes.\n\nI thought it might be the fairy anyway, and maybe it\u2019s just forming other shapes because I haven\u2019t interacted with it in too long.\n\nSo I kept trying to see as many faces coming from it as possible, which required forcing nearly absolute silence. I got many with that level of silence. But I didn\u2019t interact with them at all. I was only looking for a familiar being.\n\nAnd the weird static faces and shapes kept fading in and out. I couldn\u2019t sustain them more than 30 seconds at a time.\n\nAlso, I couldn\u2019t see where my level of silence had changed. \n\nEventually I re-discovered what I\u2019d learned before. You need to interact with it, because each interaction has the potential to release more energy, and help hold the assemblage point at its new position. Sometimes just watching isn\u2019t enough. You need to figure out some interaction.\n\nScooping energy using tensegrity is a good method. Just keep applying it to your stomach, while you watch the faces form.\n\nWhen I used a similar technique during meditation, maybe 25 years ago, I would rotate my eyes and \u201cfan\u201d anything like this I saw.

My \"gaze\" would rotate, on the outside of the image.\n\nThat caused my assemblage point to shift more, and the fanning effect increased the brightness of what I was seeing.\n\nOne time, the yellow cloud opened up into a tunnel of light, and Carlos' allies were standing in that tunnel, frantically trying to tell me something. But there was no sound.\n\nI'm starting to wonder if Carlos didn't leave a \"wake up\" message with them, and they're trying to pass it along.\n\nBut whatever they were up to, interacting with the second attention is the key to releasing a steady flow of energy you can use to sustain that position of the assemblage point.\n\nMoving the assemblage point can be accomplished merely by watching, but to keep it held in the new position, you need interacting. \n\nTaisha might even call that \"stalking\" a new position.\n\nYou have to be careful when doing that during meditation, if you're new to it. You can make the assemblage point shift so fast with that fanning technique, that it magnifies to the point of being like an explosion or seizure, from the point of view of your perception. \n\nNothing bad is likely to happen, but that can be a little disturbing at first.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f04lgxw", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally you just go with what happens, so don&amp;#39;t let me influence you too much.

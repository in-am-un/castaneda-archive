Yet another bad guy posting ludicrous nonsense.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Indigenous/comments/15u3s6z/carlos\\_castaneda\\_plastic\\_shamanism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indigenous/comments/15u3s6z/carlos_castaneda_plastic_shamanism/)\n\nSo last night while in Silent Knowledge, struggling to get any clear images, I saw a dirt road traveling along in desert territory.\n\nThe kind of plant life you'd see going from Arizona down to Mexico. I've seen it enough to recognize it \"in general\".\n\nAnd then it occurred to me.  Don Juan was enslaved as a Yaqui!  Following the Yaqui wars.\n\nZuleica's house is near Fort Ortiz, where the peace treaty was signed.  And history says, the Mexicans enslaved the Yaqui after that treaty, to prevent new rebellions.\n\nClara was even familiar with the Yaqui, implying how could she not be, living among them.\n\nNow naturally, people who read the first book of Carlos confused the Yaqui in Arizona with the Yaqui near Fort Ortiz.\n\nDon Juan had friends in both locations, since his family original came from up there.\n\nBut he'd settled near Fort Ortiz.\n\nAnd satellite photos of that area seem to make that likely.  There's probably even one available of Zuleica's house.\n\nSo I asked ChatGPT, since I can't afford the time to research this.\n\nChatGPT failed to even locate Fort Ortiz the last time I asked it, but not it has internet access.\n\nSo between my questions to ChatGPT and its answer, I saw the spinning \"Using Bing to Research\" message. Which went away or you could see it yourself in this conversation.\n\nMe:\n\nAt the end of the Yaqui wars, the Yaquis surrendered near Fort Ortiz in North Western Mexico, and many were put into slave labor camps. Do you have any records of those camps? The last time I checked, you couldn't even find Fort Ortiz on a map, despite it being on google's.  Are there any plans to update you with more Mexican history?\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nThe Yaqui Wars, particularly the events around the late 1890s and early 1900s, were indeed marked by significant conflict and suffering for the Yaqui people. In 1897, a peace treaty was signed in Ortiz between the Yaquis and the Mexican government, but hostilities soon resumed. The Mexican government under Porfirio D\u00edaz began deporting both peaceful and rebellious Yaqui natives to Yucatan and Oaxaca by 1903. During this period, the Mexican governor of Sonora, Rafael Iz\u00e1bal, led \"organized manhunts\" resulting in the capture and virtual enslavement of about 8,000 to 15,000 Yaquis\u200b\u200b.\n\nRegarding the location of Fort Ortiz, it's challenging to pinpoint its exact location. The information available does not provide a specific location for Fort Ortiz, and it seems it might not be well-documented or easily accessible in current maps or historical records. The absence of clear information about Fort Ortiz could be due to various reasons, including the passage of time and the evolving nature of geographical and political landscapes.\n\nMe:\n\nYea, except it's right on google's map.  We even have satellite pictures of it, and there's images posted by Mexican visitors to the fort.  Those aren't available to you?\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nI have conducted a search for Fort Ortiz in Mexico, particularly in relation to its historical significance and location, but the results do not seem to provide specific or detailed information about its current status on Google Maps or satellite images. It's possible that the information about Fort Ortiz, including its location and significance in the context of the Yaqui Wars, may not be widely documented or easily accessible online, or it might not be captured in the sources I can access.\n\nHowever, since you mentioned that Fort Ortiz is visible on Google Maps and there are satellite pictures and images posted by Mexican visitors, I would recommend checking Google Maps directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding its location and current status. If there are indeed images and visitor posts, these would provide valuable insights into the fort's present condition and historical context. Unfortunately, I do not have the capability to access or retrieve information from Google Maps or similar platforms directly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Don Juan's Enslavement", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 106, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"41y11awi6i1c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 82, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/41y11awi6i1c1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab7937c22526cb6e9254831d51f34fcadf480aaa"}, {"y": 164, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/41y11awi6i1c1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6fd0acfffd6413cfd8e2b2452af64ae25728c6f"}, {"y": 243, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/41y11awi6i1c1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9761341d41074ddcc91fa5b86847288be631debe"}, {"y": 486, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/41y11awi6i1c1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdccc63c2a034952b9e01f42ffde89f2ce75c6a8"}, {"y": 729, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/41y11awi6i1c1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05dd11373993d4f793160d99663fb8dd9cf06215"}, {"y": 820, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/41y11awi6i1c1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1975325ac343c1a53795f187138b2cfb3d3188db"}], "s": {"y": 2169, "x": 2856, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/41y11awi6i1c1.jpg?width=2856&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0112a456727784514c8323dbbf3eb9903f0f7580"}, "id": "41y11awi6i1c1"}}, "name": "t3_17zo939", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/0GmxZP9NydTPPT9nnFwmpk0Z4BPRFLXs4axRzQjYob0.jpg", "edited": 1700486536.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1700486057.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/41y11awi6i1c1.jpg?width=2856&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0112a456727784514c8323dbbf3eb9903f0f7580\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/41y11awi6i1c1.jpg?width=2856&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0112a456727784514c8323dbbf3eb9903f0f7580&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m too busy to do a good job on this, but you all likely read how don Juan was in a prison work camp, barely escaped, and Julian made him go back later on when he was able to face a petty tyrant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saying it was too good not to use that opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone will find and comment the story in this post?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don Juan prevailed!

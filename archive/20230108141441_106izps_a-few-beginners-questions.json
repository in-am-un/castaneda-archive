I apologize if there is a better place to put my questions or if asking them was not appropriate.\n\n1. Regrettably consistent access to a darkroom doesn't seem to be feasible, so I'm looking more in the direction of masks, blindfolds, sunglasses, etc. In the Darkroom Practice post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ifu1bv/darkroom\\_practice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ifu1bv/darkroom_practice/)) the goalball mask is suggested however the post is 2 years old and it was noted to have a few flaws so I just wanted to ask a few questions regarding it before making a purchase. 1. Is there a better alternative mask, blindfold, etc. 2. Can it be comfortably used both for long multi-hour sessions. 3. Can it serve as a long term alternative to a darkroom. 4. Can you still do everything using a mask that you'd be able to do with a darkroom, dreaming for instance. 5. Is there anything else I should know about using a mask for darkroom practice.\n2. When starting out does the darkroom need to be absolutely dark or is a tiny bit of light acceptable if unfortunate?\n3. Is the path set by the post How to see energy in 3 weeks, ([https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/aki0db/how\\_to\\_see\\_energy\\_in\\_3\\_weeks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/aki0db/how_to_see_energy_in_3_weeks/)) generally the best place to get started?  If so it states that as prelude to that to get the gist of recapitulation and dreaming, however in the post Introduction-practices ([https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/introduction-practices/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/introduction-practices/)) it says that in order to do dreaming your awareness needs to be above your ankle, are you supposed to do that before you can start to try to see energy?\n4. Are the silence stones a requirement?\n5. How important are the books, are there any that should definitely be read or should darkroom be the absolute priority?\n6. When doing recapitulation does each sweeping breath require its own scene or do you do multiple sweeping breaths per scene? If so how do you know when you are done recapitulating a scene and need to move onto the next one? Is there any benefit to recapitulating a scene you have already recapitulated in the past? How do you know if your doing recapitulation right in general?\n7. When doing Tensegrity in the darkroom at least when starting are you just supposed to repeatedly do one of the moves such as the moving your feet up and down or side to side or are you supposed to perform everything that was done in the unbending intent video?\n8. Is Tensegrity, Recapitulation, etc worth doing in the light at all or do you really only get any benefit when in the dark?\n9. Somewhere it was mentioned that you are using borrowed or finite energy to get darkroom going, do I need to worry about running out of that, if so does it ever replenish and how can I make sure to get into a position of being able to stabilize that?\n10. Just want to verify that my process for darkroom is correct. 1. Enter darkroom. 2. Suppress words/thoughts in your mind. 3. Do tensegrity until you can see the yellow scratch marks. 4. Do recap if you feel your energy is tied up somewhere. 5. Look for colors. 6. Do whatever it is you set out to do. 7. Leave the room?\n11. How do you know if you've done enough Tensegrity if you can't see energy yet?\n12.

\"extracting\" phantom details from the whitish light.\n\nI was afraid I wouldn't be able to repeat that.\n\nI suppose I'll find out tonight.\n\nBut essentially, there's a very good reason Carlos pointed that stuff out to us.\n\nIt's possible however, it's not \"responsive\" until you build your energy up high enough from your toes.\n\nYou wouldn't be able to do what you do if you hadn't, so in your case it might just be a matter of \"noticing\" it.\n\nThat you can gaze at the whitish light and cause it to spread out from where you are looking, and \"fill in details\" of a phantom scene.\n\nIt's like you gaze at whatever texture you can find, that intensifies, and the dark and light in the whitish light moves towards you and turns into a \"real\" place.\n\nIn black and white.\n\nBut not to worry.\n\nIn Silent Knowledge, \"color\" is like smell, or sound, or touch.\n\nIt's part of the \"presentation method\".\n\nIt's as if \"color\" itself were a different sense than just sight.\n\nAnd \"sight\" is just darkness and light revealing form.\n\nBut \"color\" is a \"bonus\" sense.\n\nLike colored sprinkles on a donut.\n\nI honestly don't know what those even taste like...\n\nHere's a prediction:  The practice sub will soon be filled with \"shiny outer coating puffery\".\n\nSomething that can't be learned until the energy rises up from your toes high enough.\n\nI don't believe it has to rise all the way up, in order to see it at chest level.\n\nIt will \"break off\" and flow to where you are gazing on your egg.\n\nThat stuff is INTENSE, STABLE, and you can gaze at the results of it far longer than you care to.\n\nFinally, something you don't have to work hard to keep around!\n\nLast night I made an \"Iron Man Suit\" from it.\n\nImagine intense yellow spots with an orange halo, around 1 inch in size, completely surrounding you.\n\nAs bright as fire!\n\nYou're \"encased\" in those, around 2 feet away from you.\n\nIf you gaze along them looking for \"variations\", you realize there are tiny dreams all around on them.  As darker \"mini-screens\" you can gaze at.  Sort of \"in the spaces\" but the instant you look at one it pushes towards you, and the yellow blobs around it recede back to let that specific dream be visible.  But they're still very small \"dream bubbles\".  Maybe 2 inches.\n\nThey seem to contain information and \"offers\".  However, my \"iron man\" expectations undoubtedly tainted the experience.\n\nIf I had to guess what it is, I'd say it's the \"blue ball of energy\" of the new seers preferred form for the energy body, except it's taken the \"shiny outer coating\" from the luminous egg, and is now in control of it.\n\nLike we have 3 things we can use.\n\nOur tonal body, our energy body, and also the \"shiny coating\".\n\nI'm going to have to look that one up.  Carlos said so little about it, some \"New Nagual\" bad players out there insist it's made up.\n\nBut they also insist Carlos didn't write the Tensegrity book.\n\nWhere's a \"sharp little knife\" when you need one?\n\nMaybe some day, a super advanced subreddit with \"Scaring Bad Players to Death to Steal their Energy\" techniques?\n\nJust educational of course.", "edited": 1656372479.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_idzlmlq", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several hours last night I practiced &amp;quot;extracting&amp;quot; phantom details from the whitish light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was afraid I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to repeat that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose I&amp;#39;ll find out tonight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But essentially, there&amp;#39;s a very good reason Carlos pointed that stuff out to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible however, it&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;responsive&amp;quot; until you build your energy up high enough from your toes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do what you do if you hadn&amp;#39;t, so in your case it might just be a matter of &amp;quot;noticing&amp;quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That you can gaze at the whitish light and cause it to spread out from where you are looking, and &amp;quot;fill in details&amp;quot; of a phantom scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like you gaze at whatever texture you can find, that intensifies, and the dark and light in the whitish light moves towards you and turns into a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In black and white.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not to worry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Silent Knowledge, &amp;quot;color&amp;quot; is like smell, or sound, or touch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s part of the &amp;quot;presentation method&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s as if &amp;quot;color&amp;quot; itself were a different sense than just sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;sight&amp;quot; is just darkness and light revealing form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But &amp;quot;color&amp;quot; is a &amp;quot;bonus&amp;quot; sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like colored sprinkles on a donut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;#39;t know what those even taste like...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a prediction:  The practice sub will soon be filled with &amp;quot;shiny outer coating puffery&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something that can&amp;#39;t be learned until the energy rises up from your toes high enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe it has to rise all the way up, in order to see it at chest level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will &amp;quot;break off&amp;quot; and flow to where you are gazing on your egg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That stuff is INTENSE, STABLE, and you can gaze at the results of it far longer than you care to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, something you don&amp;#39;t have to work hard to keep around!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I made an &amp;quot;Iron Man Suit&amp;quot; from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine intense yellow spots with an orange halo, around 1 inch in size, completely surrounding you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As bright as fire!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;encased&amp;quot; in those, around 2 feet away from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you gaze along them looking for &amp;quot;variations&amp;quot;, you realize there are tiny dreams all around on them.

Where all your problems are due to \"holes\".  \n\nIt wasn't true that I had one, but she could make it seem that way, in her world.\n\nShe suggested I could fill that in by sticking the bolt in there, which \"coincidentally\" was just the right size to plug \"the leak\".\n\nWhen I didn't fall for that, she gave up on offering me machine parts.\n\nThey do seem either bound by \"rules\" from infinity,  or to be predictable in how long it takes them to give up on an idea.\n\nThe Allies Carlos introduced us to, will try a given trick twice.\n\nSo will Fancy, likely my childhood \"monster under the bed\".\n\nJust don't let it get to you.  The more they can interact and make you feel like they are REAL, good or bad, the better it holds your assemblage point at a new position where magic is possible.\n\nOr moves it.\n\nI'm not convinced they want you to move past the bottom of the back.\n\nDown there if you remain in the middle they've vivid.  And the swirling pieces of your energy body (the \"puffs\") are also very bright.\n\nThat indicates the energy body (the \"double\") has his awareness \"right there\".\n\nHe's not looking out the window of the egg, like a dog riding in a car going down the freeway.\n\nHe's turned his attention to the middle, where your Tonal body is located.\n\nHe saw your snack food!  Now the middle of the car is more interesting than looking out the windows.\n\nThe IOBs absolutely crave that, because they can \"mix\" with pieces of your double.\n\nEven become \"solid\".\n\nI myself am still afraid of that sight.\n\nIt's all fun as long as they're transparent, and your hand can go right through them.\n\nBut they can in fact turn solid. For real.\n\nEven bounce on your mattress.\n\nDon't worry.\n\nThey just shifted you sideways.  That's into full on dreaming territory.\n\nIn the middle of the line of the J curve, you're in the middle of that 1 foot thick \"band of man\", moving along the path of \"least resistance\".\n\nWhen you venture to the sides, closer to the cheese slice to the left or right of Man's band, it alters which emanations in your current depth get used.\n\nIt's a smooth transition into dreaming. But awake.\n\nIn dreams they're just as real as anything else in the dream.\n\nNow, there does exist one more possibility.\n\nThat the IOBs can become \"solid\" by combining with your own energy body.\n\nJust a small piece of it!  Remember, the energy body didn't get trapped in your physical body.\n\nHalf of your energy went in there, lured by \"meaning\".  It liked the \"meaning\" of our \"tonal\" world.\n\nMaybe it fancied the donuts!\n\nBut for whatever reason, it got \"trapped\" in our organic body.\n\nThe \"puffs\" are the portion that did not.\n\nAnd they don't have to operate like a single whole!\n\nAny \"puff\" has entire worlds inside it, and can be molded with Pandora's Box Tensegrity pass into ANYTHING you can think of.\n\nAs long as you have a clean link to intent, you can make that come into being almost instantly.\n\nMaybe as little as 2 seconds to \"manufacture\" a real object or Golem.\n\nWhich can include an IOB mixing itself into the thing you created.\n\nNow you have the possibility of the solidity of the double, controlled by an inorganic being.\n\nWe have yet to reach that skill level, but you can be sure the old seers \"mastered\" that ungodly activity.  You can see it in the jade figurines they left us.

It would be simple to die; that&amp;#39;s what you say and believe, because you&amp;#39;re thinking about life, just as you&amp;#39;re thinking now what seeing would be like. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; You wanted me to describe it to you so you could begin to think about it, the way you do with everything else. In the case of seeing, however, thinking is not the issue at all, so I cannot tell you what it is like to see. Now you want me to describe the reasons for my controlled folly and I can only tell you that controlled folly is very much like seeing; it is something you cannot think about.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my personal experience &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can vouch that not emphasizing anything \nHas brought a tremendous assemblage point shifts at various times in my life.\nI use it as a formula of a mood in my inventory. It\u2019s a program that auto runs to cancel out internal dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it starts to settle in that i am gone in a sense of Ego death, and a new being. People who have emotional attachments to me emanate some fear because my responses at times lacked the signature energy that reassured them of their bias.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and so I play the game of emphasizing things again. To train the ego,\nSo pretending sometimes is not bad especially if people start thinking you\u2019re strange and you start to worry the people that love you. People fear things that syntax can not guarantee them their safety from.\nEqually emphasizing ir not emphasizing Is just reducing things to a zero state in order to see energy as it flows.

Filled with grief, sadness, remorse, anger.\n\nIt's pretty awful for those beings who mix psychically with you.  \n\nWhich the double does, if it gets too close to your body. If a purple puff touches the tonal awareness inside your 3 \"pouches\", it sucks up the feelings the tonal has at that moment.\n\nNo wonder it hides from us!\n\nBut Darkroom practice fixes that if you take it up seriously.\n\nAnd then, eventually you'll reach Silent Knowledge.\n\nWhere you can visibly see things while doing Tensegrity, which can't possibly be described.\n\nAbstract aspects of Tensegrity.\n\nI certainly couldn't draw them. I can't even figure out a single word to describe them!\n\nAnd yet, I can see them each time I practice.\n\nSo they can't be converted to this \"syntax\", and yet those are fundamental to the design of Tensegrity.\n\nThe good news is, if you see such a sight and think \"So THAT'S what this move does!\",  you'll return to the land of the rational as a result of \"noticing\" the abstract.\n\nAnd there in front of you will be an alien world.\n\nClear and stable as anything.\n\nPerhaps dark, but still a fully stable phantom world right in front of you, which you can gaze at as long as you like, is a very welcome sight.\n\nSo keep going.\n\nIt doesn't stop with \"puffs\"!\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Three Levels of Tensegrity", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 137, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"hlxre6w9qhac1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 105, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hlxre6w9qhac1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eb96d1261fda57730961102f9fa9b1e2d96e257"}, {"y": 211, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hlxre6w9qhac1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa201db682cf954eab7466f080e72b074369ed6d"}, {"y": 313, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hlxre6w9qhac1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5174bcfac679b20350f7c345090edb50f53dd7fd"}, {"y": 627, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hlxre6w9qhac1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2572735346016bdabef9cb89ec654d7ce3838da"}, {"y": 940, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hlxre6w9qhac1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=220c1e6c694e7fbf7c4bdb716e65200336a05fb1"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1045, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hlxre6w9qhac1.jpg?width=1045&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32e4bd5739d275ab4005ff6bdf713558ca9ab345"}, "id": "hlxre6w9qhac1"}}, "name": "t3_18yogwy", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/4JhuzGbJ9JSnuRwJ9ZKTX7S301M1wVmw5uP3CXJwuEY.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1704403684.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hlxre6w9qhac1.jpg?width=1045&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=32e4bd5739d275ab4005ff6bdf713558ca9ab345\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/hlxre6w9qhac1.jpg?width=1045&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=32e4bd5739d275ab4005ff6bdf713558ca9ab345&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a lot of work to make pictures myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And ChatGPT can&amp;#39;t do a good job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it can make &amp;quot;pieces&amp;quot; of a finished picture which somewhat depicts a sorcery topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as no one cares if a piece is not quite right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT doesn&amp;#39;t yet know any tensegrity moves, so he comes up with martial arts movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s fine.

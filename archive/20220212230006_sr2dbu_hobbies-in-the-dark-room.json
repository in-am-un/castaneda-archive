Are you naked in there???\"\n\nSure, go ahead and do your small side tasks, but keep your hands at your side when viewing Cholita.\n\nStill, a warning is important:  *intent* builds up like a flow, and any interruption disturbs it, it swirls around in chaos for a bit,  until you finally stop interfering and it settles down, now flowing in a slightly different direction.\n\nOne day you'll realize this clearly when someone asks  you, \"Would you see if you can...\"\n\nAnd you tell them no.\n\nAnd they say, \"But it would only take you 15 minutes to try that!\"\n\nIt's \"sorcery by proxy\".  For lazy people.\n\nBut it's also a complete misunderstanding of sorcery.\n\nSorcery is really, \"the mastery of intent\".\n\nAnd intent selects which emanations we perceive.\n\nThere's NOTHING ELSE doing that.  No reality, no \"real place that can't change\".\n\nIt's all just awareness flowing over the emanations, and then they interact based on which are glowing, and how that glow moved around in the past, and which other humans are overlapping that glow.\n\nA big out of control mess.\n\nRiver of shit land.\n\nUntil, you control where your awareness is being directed.\n\nCurtail it, to \"save energy\" for something more important.\n\nPretty soon you realize, you have to be SERIOUS about that, or you don't get as many cool things to happen in the darkroom.\n\nMaybe you get around to doing that recap you've been putting off, once you realize you need to gain energy, and it's so hard to control your daytime behavior. Go find the lost energy of the past.\n\nBut eventually, you have to learn not to lose more in your daily interactions.\n\nYou possibly figure out not to tell stupid jokes in the grocery store line.\n\nOr get friendly with a stranger at the airport,  and \"chat him up\".\n\nUnfortunately, any \"collision\" with another human, mixes your emanations with theirs.\n\nYou get \"worn out\".\n\nDon Juan brilliantly alerted us to this fact with some \"casual\" things he said to Carlos.\n\nBut which were extremely \"deep\".  I wish I could find my favorite.\n\nDidn't have luck in the searchable pdf.\n\nIt's something like, a normal person watching a sorcerer go by would never notice that he's seen everything.\n\nIt means, his attention doesn't wander needlessly.\n\nSo as he leaves the grocery store he doesn't turn his head because he hears an interesting sound.\n\nHe's not \"looking for trouble\".\n\nHe also hasn't fixed his gaze on anything,  so he's using peripheral vision which gives him super sight. And his mind is silent, so he has super hearing.  He has no thoughts, so that he will *see*.\n\nThat's how he \"sees everything\".  By not focusing his awareness he doesn't miss the things he would have looked away from.  He gets it all, and diminishes his internal dialogue at the same time because it's flooded with too much information to obsess over anything.\n\nYou use the same \"rule\" in dreaming. If you want to extend your lucid dreaming energy, you don't get obsessed with anything. Instead you try to perceive only using slight glances.\n\nThat also makes sure you don't embed some \"entanglement energy\" into a stray IOB in dreaming.  Some don't notice you, unless you notice them.\n\nYou're trying to maintain an energy saving \"flow\".\n\nThe same happens in the darkroom.\n\nAlthough it's not obvious you are also \"walking through a parking lot\" in the darkroom,  you certainly will realize eventually that you are indeed \"traveling\".\n\nCarlos called it, \"navigating\".\n\nSo to continue the analogy, the person who asks you to do an experiment for him, is as rude as someone asking you to hand out Jehovah's Witness pamphlets for them, the next time you go to the grocery store.  Just stick them under the wiper blades on the windows!\n\nIt's not \"free\". There's a cost to doing things that take you off your path.\n\nIt's no different in the darkroom.\n\nSo the answer in the case of someone making a request, is \"just say no\".\n\nYou can tell them I said so. And you'd like to, but what can you do?\n\nI like to blame Cholita.  She's nuts!  What can I do???\n\nThen there's your own \"hobbies\".\n\nWhat if you take your kazoo, and serenade the puffs?\n\nThat's tricky.\n\nKazoo, ok. Sure. That'll \"crystallize\" the second attention fog, and the air blowing will enhanced details on translocation scenes, or brighten up the highlights on your inorganic being.\n\nBut the intent of it, to \"serenade\" the puffs, is a bit of a deviation.\n\nMaybe, wait until you can pass this intermediate skill level test?\n\nSave the deviations for when it's very obvious you aren't just trying to get out of practicing the hard part (silence).", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\"Hobbies\" in the Dark Room", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"t35e31zfzgh81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t35e31zfzgh81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de912a729cb20999c1582f7f45421863ccf9910d"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t35e31zfzgh81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a618fcaaf4e83227b2c4cdb5cb0f3a8ea05e2fc9"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t35e31zfzgh81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28bb5728871ed2706cf3a37a121154c2f753246b"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t35e31zfzgh81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=711b9d594d8df6fffa0c2749a1717ed26e2185c0"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t35e31zfzgh81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70fc1441c12c3996493b63972ead3828135c9477"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t35e31zfzgh81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9cc8514387e26c972c95d197226195913b67129"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/t35e31zfzgh81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54c0e2571e96b2bc6926d5732473033de2baeeb9"}, "id": "t35e31zfzgh81"}}, "name": "t3_sr2dbu", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/olZoHnIjV3QBr1ZgjBYrJUl3KG4YdGd2bOgWwsjJFEo.jpg", "edited": 1644703785.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1644703206.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/t35e31zfzgh81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=54c0e2571e96b2bc6926d5732473033de2baeeb9\"&gt;Old pics, but they do illustrate a \\&amp;quot;process\\&amp;quot; you can follow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people say, &amp;quot;Can I pet my cat while playing with puffs?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eat Jelly Beans?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Serenade the puffs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or as Cholita is fond of asking, &amp;quot;What exactly are you doing in the dark while remote viewing me?

I\u2019ve told them that they don\u2019t even realise that the very thing they\u2019re arguing against is the same thing that people here agree with, doesn\u2019t seem to work though, self-importance and winning the argument takes the reigns at that point, it\u2019s like there is this switch at a certain point in the discussion where the only thing that matters is being right.\n\n\\[TechnoMagical\\_Intent\\] - You could state that the only way to get the knowledge out to as broad an audience as possibly in the 1960\u2019s-1990\u2019s was to be a \\*\\*successful\\*\\* author (people actually buying the books).\n\nThere was no internet, until the very last few years.\n\nBeing a published author was one of the few ways someone unknown could chance to make obscure information mainstream.\n\n\\[danl999 \\] - And don't forget Morongo when considering why Carlos started making books.\n\nMy father helped set up a printing press there which survives to this day.\n\nCarlos first went there, and undoubtedly saw the model. Any indian related topic became something they could publish, which ended up helping the tribe preserve their knowledge.\n\nHe would have seen it as natural to publish the first one. Too bad he didn't use Malki press!\n\nLooking back now it's easy to forget the history. And that his scholarly community (UC System) as instrumental in the publishing at Morongo.\n\nCarlos also visited Carabeth Laird when she was sick in the hospital. She's an indian author of \"Encounter with an Angry God\", also from Morongo press.\n\nCarlos was swimming in the \"indian book\" community.\n\nCarabeth is the one who gave my father an \"evil bear claw wand\", which my father claimed was coming to life at night, so he gave it to UC Riverside to display.\n\n\"Popular History\" always gets the context wrong, and views the past in terms of current levels of greed.\n\nThe other key thing to understand was the even Einstein was taking \"power plants\" back then. It was new, it was cool, and there wasn't much social stigma.\n\nThe hippies who wanted to use drugs to circumvent all the hard work of Yogi's like Maharishi, came after Carlos.

But not a delusional rant please.\n\nDreaming is best done awake, if you want to learn the finer points.  If you want to \"get lucky\" every few months, and have 15 minutes of sleeping lucid dreaming, fine.\n\nSomeone on facebook even has a sort of \"camp\" thing going, and you can earn your \"lucid dreamer\" patch to sew on your coat.\n\nHow about adding a \"waking dreamer\" patch?\n\n15 minutes of lucid dreaming, a few times a year, will never rival 3 hours a night in a darkroom!\n\nBack to the book. Carlos:\n\n\"La Gorda said that it took her several years, under Zuleica's guidance, to learn dreaming...\"\n\n\"Zuleica was very effective as my guide into the second attention. She insisted that our interaction take place only at night, and in total darkness. For me, Zuleica was only a voice in the dark, a voice that started every contact we had by telling me to focus my attention on her words and nothing else. Her voice was the woman's voice that la Gorda thought she had heard in dreaming...\"\n\nNote from Mystery: The 8 point diagram position of \"Talking\",  does not require speaking.\n\n\"I heard a rustling sound just behind me and then Zuleica's voice jolted me. In a forceful whisper she told me to get up and follow her. I automatically obeyed her. I could not see her face, she was only a dark shape walking two steps ahead of me.\n\nShe led me to an alcove in the darkest hall in her house. Although my eyes were used to the darkness I was still unable to see a thing. I stumbled on something and she commanded me to sit down inside a narrow crib and support my lower back with something I thought was a hard cushion.\n\nI next felt that she had backed up a few steps behind me, a thing which baffled me completely, for I thought that my back was only a few inches from the wall. Speaking from behind me, she ordered me in a soft voice to focus my attention on her words and let them guide me. She told me to keep my eyes open and fixed on a point right in front of me, at my eye level; and that this point was going to turn from darkness to a bright and pleasing orange-red...\"\n\n\"Zuleica explained that a dreamer must start from a point of color; intense light or unmitigated darkness are useless to a dreamer in the initial onslaught. Colors such as purple or light green or rich yellow are, on the other hand, stupendous starting points. She preferred, however, orangered, because through experience it had proven to be the one that gave her the greatest sensation of rest. She assured me that once I had succeeded in entering into the orange-red color I would have rallied my second attention permanently, providing that I could be aware of the sequence of physical events.\n\nIt took me several sessions with Zuleica's voice to realize with my body what she wanted me to do. The advantage of being in a state of heightened awareness was that I could follow my transition from a state of vigil to a state of dreaming.\"\n\nNotice: He started in heightened awareness.\n\nThat's the reason we play around so much in the darkroom. Because we don't have don Juan to put us there.  We have to follow the J curve instructions Carlos gave out, just a few months before he died.  That included puffery.\n\nWithout that, the puffs of color won't come out.  You need the second attention.\n\nIt also has the benefit of redeploying energy back to the center, to form the energy body.\n\n\"Under normal conditions that transition is blurred, but under those special circumstances I actually felt in the course of one session how my second attention took over the controls. The first step was an unusual difficulty in breathing. It was not a difficulty in inhaling or exhaling; I was not short of breath - rather, my breathing changed rhythm all of a sudden. My diaphragm began to contract and it forced my midsection to move in and out with great speed. The result was the fastest short breaths I had ever taken. I breathed in the lower part of my lungs and felt a great pressure in my intestines. I tried unsuccessfully to break the spasms of my diaphragm. The harder I tried, the more painful it got.\n\nZuleica ordered me to let my body do whatever was necessary and to forget about directing or controlling it. I wanted to obey her, but I did not know how. The spasms, which must have lasted ten to fifteen minutes, subsided as suddenly as they had appeared and were followed by another strange, shocking sensation. I felt it first as a most peculiar itch, a physical feeling which was not pleasing or displeasing; it was something like a nervous tremor. It became very intense, to the point of forcing me to focus my attention on it in order to determine where in my body it was happening. I was stunned by the realization that it was not taking place anywhere in my physical body, but outside of it, and yet I still felt it.\n\nI disregarded Zuleica's order to enter into a patch of coloration that was forming right at my eye level, and gave myself fully to the exploration of that strange sensation outside me. Zuleica must have seen what I was going through; she suddenly began to explain that the second attention belongs to the luminous body, as the first attention belongs to the physical body. The point where, she said, the second attention assembles itself was situated right where Juan Tuma had described it the first time we met - approximately one and one-half feet in front of the midpoint between the stomach and the belly button and four inches to the right.\n\nZuleica ordered me to massage that place, to manipulate it by moving the fingers of both my hands right on that point as if I were playing a harp. She assured me that sooner or later I would end up feeling my fingers going through something as thick as water, and that finally I would feel my luminous shell.\n\nAs I kept on moving my fingers the air got progressively thicker until I felt a mass of sorts. An undefined physical pleasure spread all over me. I thought that I was touching a nerve in my body and felt silly at the absurdity of it. I stopped.\n\nZuleica warned me that if I did not move my fingers she was going to bop me on the head.\n\nThe longer I kept up the wavering motion, the closer I felt the itching. It finally got as near as five or six inches from my body. It was as if something in me had shrunk. I actually thought I could feel a dent. I then had another eerie sensation. I was falling asleep and yet I was conscious.\n\nThere was a buzzing in my ears, which reminded me of the sound of a bullroarer; next I felt a force rolling me over on my left side without waking me up. I was rolled very tightly, like a cigar, and was tucked into the itching depression. My awareness remained suspended there, incapable of waking up, but so tightly rolled on itself that I could not fall asleep either...\"\n\n\"La Gorda said that she and Josefina lived in Zuleica's house for several months. The Nagual Juan Matus had delivered them to her one day after making them shift levels of awareness. He did not tell them what they were going to do there nor what to expect, he simply left them by themselves in the hall of her house and walked away. They sat there until it got dark. Zuleica then came to them. They never saw her, they only heard her voice as if she were talking to them from a point on the wall.\n\nZuleica was very demanding from the moment she took over. She made them undress on the spot and ordered both of them to crawl inside thick fluffy cotton bags, some poncho-like garments that were lying on the floor. They covered them from neck to toes. She ordered them next to sit back to back on a mat in the same alcove where I myself used to sit. She told them that their task was to gaze at the darkness until it began to acquire a hue. After many sessions they indeed began to see colors in the darkness, at which time Zuleica made them sit side by side and gaze at the same spot.\n\nLa Gorda said that Josefina learned very fast, and that one night she dramatically entered into the patch of orange-red by swishing physically out of the poncho. La Gorda thought that either Josefina had reached out for the blotch of color or it had reached out for her. The result was that in one instant Josefina was gone from inside the poncho. Zuleica separated them from then on, and la Gorda started her slow, solitary learning.\"\n\nSo, reading between the lines, Josefina simply changed to her energy body, as soon as she saw the color.  That's the only way we've learned about to travel like that, taking the physical body along.  To switch to the energy body. We only have 4 bodies to choose from, as a post of mine this week shows.\n\nBut it still took Josefina herself, many sessions to see colors.  That's what women, especially the crazy ones, can do.  It's hard for them to find things on their own, but once they find it they can go so far into it, it leaves the men in the dust.\n\nI'll always remember giving advice to a witch who was having problems. I gave very detailed advise, carefully reasoned out, with exercises she could use.\n\nHer reply was, \"Just tell me what I can do. I don't need a lecture!\"\n\nNote: The crazy ones like Josefina need a handler, so don't long for more of them.  A man has to provide the motivation. Plus they'll kick his ass from time to time.\n\nIf you can't enjoy their prowess because you are a beginner, don't even try it.  Don't \"assemble your own lineage.\"\n\nPeople do that.  It's 100% delusional, just in case anyone thought that sounded like a good idea.\n\nLa Gorda was separated from Josefina, perhaps because her second attention energy body wasn't formed enough to switch to it the way Josefina did, so together wouldn't work out.\n\nAnd reading WAY between the lines.  When Josefina was grabbed by Emilito, and then waited for La Gorda to \"show up\", it was obviously waking dreaming.\n\nSomeone pointed to that as evidence of shared sleeping dreaming.\n\nBut, Zuleica = Emilito.  And La Gorda with Josefina practicing more dreaming, under the guidance of Zuleica?\n\nIt's waking dreaming!  \n\nBut, \\*\\*after\\*\\* you step into full on dreaming, from fully awake with eyes open.\n\nI do it all the time!  In fact, last night I had a hard time telling the difference.\n\nI'd hear Cholita make a noise, go to see, and realize I'd stepped into sleeping dreaming.  So I went back, after far too long not figuring it out.  We even got into an argument about the shape of some food Cholita made, as if that were a normal thing to be discussing.\n\nIf it were the other kind of dreaming the 3 of them did together,  Emilito would have to be the luckiest dreaming double on the planet, to have both Josefina and La Gorda get lucid enough on the same night, without some planning.  Or to even be available at all.  The dreamer is typically so lost in infinity, you can't find it.\n\nBut if it was known they practiced waking dreaming at a certain time, it's manageable.\n\nAnd when Carlos felt his energy body, he ignored the instructions of Zuleica to enter into a patch of color.\n\nZuleica saw that his energy body was well formed enough for him to skip to that step of wiggling to activate it.\n\nIn our case, ours is not.\n\nSo too much wiggling during darkroom, is counter productive.\n\nDo it once in awhile, because it stimulates awareness of the energy body.\n\nEspecially do it, when you make your energy body glow visibly.\n\nBut the energy body belongs to the second attention, so we want it stimulated in order to see the colors.  We wiggle periodically, but we shouldn't obsess over it early on.\n\nIt's a vast world in that vortex!  Wiggle territory (18 inches out, 4 inches to the right), is a universe all to itself.\n\nBut to sum it up,  I can attest that you get the coolest results if you keep scooping colors onto the body, and looking for more to scoop or scrape.  And avoid too many \"experiments\".\n\nBy the way, if you see a giant patch of color, but no puffs, what can you do?\n\nYou're wrong!\n\nIt's just a gigantic puffs.  In fact, your puffs are superior. They're bigger. That counts in Texas.\n\nScoop the whole wall if you have to.  Just learn to turn the head in coordination with the hand, to give the \"illusion\" you are scooping it onto your stomach.\n\nAnd learn to compress it too.  You can compress it with \"patty cake\" games like the \"Pandora's Box\" pass in the wiki, or by simply squeezing it with the hand.  Carlos did both in class!\n\nCarlos shows us how to place them on the body, over here.  Notice how the head turns with the hand:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273\\_PU&amp;t=5m22s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;t=5m22s)\n\nAnd the \"compress it\" part is a little sad. I prefer to keep the hand open but cupped, so I can watch it as I move it down.   So consider crushing it against the torso as an option at first.\n\nBut don't worry!  You won't have to do that head moves with hands thing later on.  The part that makes it seem like a side effect of the eye, and you're daft to be claiming  you just scooped it.\n\nIt will be VERY frightening the first time the puffs \"come alive\" and stay wherever they want to.\n\nYou can even form them into objects:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/bil7rf2jiry41.jpg?width=1190&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f37969328722b39d7b7baa981d402839a073cde3](https://preview.redd.it/bil7rf2jiry41.jpg?width=1190&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f37969328722b39d7b7baa981d402839a073cde3)\n\nSome tips: Those puffs you scoop onto yourself, can be scooped into a pile in front of you, and an inorganic being can take it over.\n\nYour double can even make use of it.\n\nIt's a \"body\".\n\nThe puffs, each one of them, is a potential \"body\" for an inorganic being.\n\nThat's why they tend to show up there.\n\nAt least, this is what Fancy and Mystery claim, and it seems to be true.\n\nAnd won't hurt to think of it that way.\n\nJuan's even \"fed\" pinkish puffs to Fairy, as I used to do.\n\nJust remember: our goal is to build the second attention energy body, which means, put those puffs on your body.  Until it's literally glowing intensely.\n\nIt will!  Won't remain long though. The puff on the body has a \"persistence\" meaning, it fades back to the inside of the luminous shell.\n\nYou're \"redeploying\" the energy, but it soon gets push back to the periphery.\n\nIt'll only stay like that, when you \"switch over\".\n\nWith wiggling.\n\nBut there are other ways, as Josefina showed us.\n\nMy favorite way to increase the \"puff persistence\" is to move my assemblage point just short of \"silent knowledge\".\n\nWhy not all the way?\n\nI wish I could on demand!\n\nBut that's not the reason.\n\nOnce it gets to \"Silent Knowledge\", you no longer care about puffs or energy bodies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "An example of reading between the lines, from Eagle's Gift", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 92, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"wbdwojqiutp61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 76, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wbdwojqiutp61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21c349b7f47310cdefeec83ff5c77f12272bbb4c"}, {"y": 152, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wbdwojqiutp61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44c523c5ebfe2a5d7c3e044f84f6ae0627fd15e5"}, {"y": 226, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wbdwojqiutp61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=351c1a749836f3c91aec36b414ad2a81ab83b576"}, {"y": 452, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wbdwojqiutp61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3360e628fb7b6d3701dc47940cfa25734bfc7d47"}], "s": {"y": 678, "x": 958, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wbdwojqiutp61.jpg?width=958&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c083e09fbba64ecd1212f17cca0f94ec1211acc8"}, "id": "wbdwojqiutp61"}}, "name": "t3_mf5lyn", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 12, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/qwrrOyWlS9m6-IpScndEpcalPH5w2Aoh-ytJAI-GHdg.jpg", "edited": 1616964702.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1616952931.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wbdwojqiutp61.jpg?width=958&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c083e09fbba64ecd1212f17cca0f94ec1211acc8\"&gt;This is no exaggeration but if you didn&amp;#39;t do a good recap, it might be dimmer for you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to &amp;quot;read between the lines&amp;quot; when reading the writings of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But only because we don&amp;#39;t have Carlos anymore.

She assured me that sooner or later I would end up feeling my fingers going through something as thick as water, and that finally I would feel my luminous shell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I kept on moving my fingers the air got progressively thicker until I felt a mass of sorts. An undefined physical pleasure spread all over me. I thought that I was touching a nerve in my body and felt silly at the absurdity of it. I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica warned me that if I did not move my fingers she was going to bop me on the head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The longer I kept up the wavering motion, the closer I felt the itching. It finally got as near as five or six inches from my body. It was as if something in me had shrunk. I actually thought I could feel a dent. I then had another eerie sensation. I was falling asleep and yet I was conscious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a buzzing in my ears, which reminded me of the sound of a bullroarer; next I felt a force rolling me over on my left side without waking me up. I was rolled very tightly, like a cigar, and was tucked into the itching depression. My awareness remained suspended there, incapable of waking up, but so tightly rolled on itself that I could not fall asleep either...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;La Gorda said that she and Josefina lived in Zuleica&amp;#39;s house for several months. The Nagual Juan Matus had delivered them to her one day after making them shift levels of awareness. He did not tell them what they were going to do there nor what to expect, he simply left them by themselves in the hall of her house and walked away. They sat there until it got dark. Zuleica then came to them. They never saw her, they only heard her voice as if she were talking to them from a point on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica was very demanding from the moment she took over. She made them undress on the spot and ordered both of them to crawl inside thick fluffy cotton bags, some poncho-like garments that were lying on the floor. They covered them from neck to toes. She ordered them next to sit back to back on a mat in the same alcove where I myself used to sit. She told them that their task was to gaze at the darkness until it began to acquire a hue. After many sessions they indeed began to see colors in the darkness, at which time Zuleica made them sit side by side and gaze at the same spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;La Gorda said that Josefina learned very fast, and that one night she dramatically entered into the patch of orange-red by swishing physically out of the poncho. La Gorda thought that either Josefina had reached out for the blotch of color or it had reached out for her. The result was that in one instant Josefina was gone from inside the poncho. Zuleica separated them from then on, and la Gorda started her slow, solitary learning.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, reading between the lines, Josefina simply changed to her energy body, as soon as she saw the color.  That&amp;#39;s the only way we&amp;#39;ve learned about to travel like that, taking the physical body along.  To switch to the energy body. We only have 4 bodies to choose from, as a post of mine this week shows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it still took Josefina herself, many sessions to see colors.  That&amp;#39;s what women, especially the crazy ones, can do.  It&amp;#39;s hard for them to find things on their own, but once they find it they can go so far into it, it leaves the men in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll always remember giving advice to a witch who was having problems. I gave very detailed advise, carefully reasoned out, with exercises she could use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her reply was, &amp;quot;Just tell me what I can do. I don&amp;#39;t need a lecture!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: The crazy ones like Josefina need a handler, so don&amp;#39;t long for more of them.  A man has to provide the motivation. Plus they&amp;#39;ll kick his ass from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t enjoy their prowess because you are a beginner, don&amp;#39;t even try it.  Don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;assemble your own lineage.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People do that.  It&amp;#39;s 100% delusional, just in case anyone thought that sounded like a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;La Gorda was separated from Josefina, perhaps because her second attention energy body wasn&amp;#39;t formed enough to switch to it the way Josefina did, so together wouldn&amp;#39;t work out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And reading WAY between the lines.  When Josefina was grabbed by Emilito, and then waited for La Gorda to &amp;quot;show up&amp;quot;, it was obviously waking dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone pointed to that as evidence of shared sleeping dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, Zuleica = Emilito.  And La Gorda with Josefina practicing more dreaming, under the guidance of Zuleica?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s waking dreaming!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, **after** you step into full on dreaming, from fully awake with eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do it all the time!  In fact, last night I had a hard time telling the difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d hear Cholita make a noise, go to see, and realize I&amp;#39;d stepped into sleeping dreaming.  So I went back, after far too long not figuring it out.  We even got into an argument about the shape of some food Cholita made, as if that were a normal thing to be discussing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it were the other kind of dreaming the 3 of them did together,  Emilito would have to be the luckiest dreaming double on the planet, to have both Josefina and La Gorda get lucid enough on the same night, without some planning.  Or to even be available at all.  The dreamer is typically so lost in infinity, you can&amp;#39;t find it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if it was known they practiced waking dreaming at a certain time, it&amp;#39;s manageable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when Carlos felt his energy body, he ignored the instructions of Zuleica to enter into a patch of color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica saw that his energy body was well formed enough for him to skip to that step of wiggling to activate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our case, ours is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So too much wiggling during darkroom, is counter productive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do it once in awhile, because it stimulates awareness of the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially do it, when you make your energy body glow visibly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the energy body belongs to the second attention, so we want it stimulated in order to see the colors.  We wiggle periodically, but we shouldn&amp;#39;t obsess over it early on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a vast world in that vortex!  Wiggle territory (18 inches out, 4 inches to the right), is a universe all to itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to sum it up,  I can attest that you get the coolest results if you keep scooping colors onto the body, and looking for more to scoop or scrape.  And avoid too many &amp;quot;experiments&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you see a giant patch of color, but no puffs, what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re wrong!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a gigantic puffs.  In fact, your puffs are superior. They&amp;#39;re bigger. That counts in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scoop the whole wall if you have to.  Just learn to turn the head in coordination with the hand, to give the &amp;quot;illusion&amp;quot; you are scooping it onto your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And learn to compress it too.  You can compress it with &amp;quot;patty cake&amp;quot; games like the &amp;quot;Pandora&amp;#39;s Box&amp;quot; pass in the wiki, or by simply squeezing it with the hand.  Carlos did both in class!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos shows us how to place them on the body, over here.  Notice how the head turns with the hand:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;amp;t=5m22s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;amp;t=5m22s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;quot;compress it&amp;quot; part is a little sad. I prefer to keep the hand open but cupped, so I can watch it as I move it down.   So consider crushing it against the torso as an option at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t worry!  You won&amp;#39;t have to do that head moves with hands thing later on.  The part that makes it seem like a side effect of the eye, and you&amp;#39;re daft to be claiming  you just scooped it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will be VERY frightening the first time the puffs &amp;quot;come alive&amp;quot; and stay wherever they want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can even form them into objects:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bil7rf2jiry41.jpg?width=1190&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f37969328722b39d7b7baa981d402839a073cde3\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bil7rf2jiry41.jpg?width=1190&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f37969328722b39d7b7baa981d402839a073cde3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some tips: Those puffs you scoop onto yourself, can be scooped into a pile in front of you, and an inorganic being can take it over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your double can even make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;body&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The puffs, each one of them, is a potential &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; for an inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why they tend to show up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, this is what Fancy and Mystery claim, and it seems to be true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And won&amp;#39;t hurt to think of it that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan&amp;#39;s even &amp;quot;fed&amp;quot; pinkish puffs to Fairy, as I used to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember: our goal is to build the second attention energy body, which means, put those puffs on your body.  Until it&amp;#39;s literally glowing intensely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will!  Won&amp;#39;t remain long though. The puff on the body has a &amp;quot;persistence&amp;quot; meaning, it fades back to the inside of the luminous shell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;redeploying&amp;quot; the energy, but it soon gets push back to the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll only stay like that, when you &amp;quot;switch over&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With wiggling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there are other ways, as Josefina showed us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite way to increase the &amp;quot;puff persistence&amp;quot; is to move my assemblage point just short of &amp;quot;silent knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why not all the way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could on demand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s not the reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once it gets to &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;, you no longer care about puffs or energy bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

pushed through the middle.   Not along the outside of the cheese slice.\n\nRemember, the second attention weirdness (puffs, floating dreams) calms down when you get to the end of the J curve.\n\nI'd say the weirdest stuff is likely when the assemblage point is very low, coming around to the front.  Maybe the crystalline dreaming fog itself, is created by being at the bottom.\n\nLiterally.  Yuck. There's an extra opening there.  Don't think about that too much...\n\nYou can force some weirdness to manifest, but in general, the air clears of puffs and floating dreams when you get near to the end.\n\nSo it's consistent with what happens with the Nagual's blow.\n\nIn my case, I play with puffs in order to \"clear the air\", so I can see whitish light on the walls, and assemble another world.\n\nI like to do that nightly if possible.\n\nThen I ignore that, and it seems to then be possible to do it in the air, around the room. And even scoop the floating views into your hand.\n\nOr enter them.\n\nBUT, they don't show up unless you look for them.  Your connecting link to intent is clearer.\n\nSo I suspect they're in nearly the same state with us.\n\nNaguals blow, or finish the J curve manually.\n\nCarlos commented that he could clearly watch the transition from restful vigil to dreaming.  Whereas when you normally go into dreaming, there's a blurred transition.

Maybe the crystalline dreaming fog itself, is created by being at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Literally.  Yuck. There&amp;#39;s an extra opening there.  Don&amp;#39;t think about that too much...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can force some weirdness to manifest, but in general, the air clears of puffs and floating dreams when you get near to the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s consistent with what happens with the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case, I play with puffs in order to &amp;quot;clear the air&amp;quot;, so I can see whitish light on the walls, and assemble another world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to do that nightly if possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I ignore that, and it seems to then be possible to do it in the air, around the room.

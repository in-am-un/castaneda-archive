His  eyes  were  half-closed again but  I  felt  he  was  peering at  me. He  nodded almost imperceptibly. Then his  lids  opened and I  saw  his  eyes. He  seemed to be  looking past  me. He  casually tapped the floor  with the  tip of  his  right  foot, just  behind his  left  heel. His  legs  were  slightly arched;  his  arms  were  limp against  his  sides. Then he  lifted his-right  arm;  his  hand was  open with the  palm  turned perpendicular  to the ground;  his  fingers  were  extended and pointing toward me. He  let  his  hand wobble  a  couple  of  times  before  he brought  it  to my face  level. He  held it  in that  position for  an instant  and then he  said a  few  words  to me. His  voice was  very clear, yet  the  words  dragged. \n\nAfter  a  moment  he  dropped his  hand to his  side  and remained motionless, taking a  strange  position. He  was standing, resting on the  ball  of  his  left  foot. His  right  foot  was  crossed behind the  heel  of  the  left  foot  and he  was tapping the  floor  rhythmically and gently with the  tip of  his  right  foot.\n\nI  felt  an unwarranted apprehension, a  form  of  restlessness. My thoughts  seemed to be  dissociated. I  was thinking unrelated nonsensical  thoughts  that  had nothing to do with what  was  going on. I  noticed my discomfort and tried to steer  my thoughts  back to the  situation at  hand, but  I  couldn't  in spite  of  a  great  struggle. It  was  as  if some  force  was  keeping me  from  concentrating or  thinking relevant  thoughts. \n\nSacateca  had not  said a  word, and I  didn't  know  what  else  to say or  do. Quite  automatically, I  turned around and left. \n\nLater  on I  felt  compelled to tell  don Juan about  my encounter  with Sacateca.

I  felt  very cold and dizzy.\"\n\n\"He  apparently didn't  like  you and stopped you by tossing a  word at  you.\" \n\n\"How  could he  possibly do that?\"  I  exclaimed incredulously.\n\n\"Very simple;  he  stopped you with his  will!\"", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gnq04v6", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This?

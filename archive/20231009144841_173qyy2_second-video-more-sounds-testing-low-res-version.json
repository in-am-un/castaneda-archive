It's coming fast!\n\nI used to marvel at how women heard more sound during darkroom.\n\nI was even a bit \"suspicious\".  My own bad player tendency.\n\nBut now I understand it completely.\n\nThere's no second attention \"sight\", which doesn't have ALL other senses present at the same time.\n\nAnd women have at least a whole leg off in dreaming somewhere at any given time.\n\nYou may not detect the sounds, but that's mostly because you're barely hanging on to the amazing magical sight.\n\nAnd don't think to \"smell\" it.  Or listen to it, or see if it has a temperature difference.\n\nAnd NO ONE wants to \"feel\" those god awful demonic visions in the air.\n\nOr worse, the heavenly (sexy) ones.\n\nSo we just use our sight.\n\nBut in \"full on\" Silent Knowledge those visions are actually dream tunnels.\n\nAnd you aren't \"on the other side\" looking at a flat window.\n\nIt's an immersive experience.\n\nSo if you never hear sound effects, don't sweat it.\n\nThey're coming!\n\nThe odd thing is how easily we tend to ignore them.\n\nI can't figure that out. It's almost like, you have to force yourself not to  dismiss the sound before you begin to be able to notice it.\n\nIt's there!\n\nBut you don't recall it until 30 seconds later, and then your feeling is \"How could I have ignored that???\"\n\nBut you do.\n\nWorse, it's actually difficult to remember Silent Knowledge, at the beginner's level.\n\nOn a good night, you perceive 20 \"marvels of the universe\".\n\nAnd are lucky to remember one.\n\nBeginner's for SK = skilled intermediate darkroom practitioner.\n\nBut from the point of view of SK, which is utterly VAST, when you first get there you're a beginner all over again just like the \"good old days\" when you worried you'd never be able to find a purple puff in the darkness.\n\nYou just end up with new worries.\n\nSuch as \"what do all those old seers want, and are they actually there?\"\n\nI haven't added those to this cartoon yet, but I did purchase them online for $10.\n\nJust assorted heads.

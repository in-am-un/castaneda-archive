As for the word \"installation\", it means composition, a special arrangement of various objects (elements). We are not talking about \"installation\" in the sense that it is often understood - like a CD-disk or something similar inside the brain. And even more so, there is no \"alien device\" that lives in the head and that needs to be removed. Installation does not meaning \"device\". Computer analogies in everyday thinking create a completely wrong association, which means they form an erroneous understanding. There were no personal computers and smartphone then, remember?\n\nThe meaning of foreign installation is seen as \"external influence\" (on our mind) or \"external construction\" (in the mind). In his lectures, Castaneda also used the synonymous term - imposition. Simply put, this is not our own mental \"composition\" inside our mind, but created under the influence of external factors. In terms of meaning, this concept is close to the concept of common sense, but it is developed from a specific view of descriptions of brujo (different glossing). In a way, it is synonymous with the concept of \"emotional mind\", which wastes and throws energy into the wind by blindly reacting to external factors and other people's patterns. And it is important here that the concept gives a clear indication of the cultivation of consciousness by own mind. Not a rejection of the mind, but on the contrary - the cleansing of the mind from external influences.\n\nSo that there is no doubt that foreign has a meaning as \"external\", the word comes from the Latin foraneus - which means \"outside\" (foris - outside, literally \"outside the door\"). As for installation, the meaning comes from \"location\" and \"position\" (somewhere) or \"location\" (literally: to place (standing) among others, by type - in a row). The meanings are interesting: get into position, lose power, put in a stall. By etymology, synonyms are inauguration and induction (!). For the most part, the terms have a church semantic connotation, which sends us to the fact that some naguals were churchmen, which means they knew scholasticism (remember Castaneda spoke about it?). This is where you need to look for the roots of concepts and words, and not in how to install the application on a smartphone :)))\n\nAnd here we again find that in reality we are talking about the development of our own mind, our own thinking and understanding, as the foundation on which consciousness will begin to grow (consciousness can open in us). Change the composition of the mind, start thinking by yourself, and not wait for someone to do it from the outside. There is a saying: if you don\u2019t think by yourself, they will think for you.

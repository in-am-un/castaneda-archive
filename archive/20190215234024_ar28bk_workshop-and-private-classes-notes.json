Only those \n\nshown were taught in Colorado.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShoulder rolls to loosen up.  Also do Arm rolls.  Same as LA and Maui.\n\nLean slightly forward during shoulder rolls, same as LA.  With arm rolls,\n\nhand it palm up at top when rolling forward, but it drops to palm down\n\nas the movement begins.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFluidity foot:  Left foot faces left, right foot 1.5 feet away, facing\n\nfront (similar to cat stance but 90 degrees between feet).  Foot stays\n\non that spot the whole time.  Angle it, but as it angles you turn\n\nthe shoulders the opposite direction with the right arm pointing all the\n\nway back or even wraping around the waist.  The left arm also points back\n\nbut the two are parallel to each other.  You are turned quite a ways\n\naround.  Hold to count of 10.  Do 4 this way, then switch feet.\n\nNext, do same but turn body same direction as foot.  Just the torso twists,\n\nnot the hips.  They face front.  Head may turn if desired.  Arms turn\n\ntoo.  But both feet face front, not the 90 degrees of the first method.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeel, toe: Like LA but start from horse stance, lift leg that is going to\n\nmove, shifting weight to other, then begin.  Horse stance should be\n\nquite a bit shallower than karate.  Keep buttocks like you are just about\n\nto sit on a stool, but you stopped in the air just above it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeg sweep: Also starts from horse like heel, toe.  Nyei uses her arms to\n\ncoordinate it.  When leg back, same arm front and angled around chest. \n\nSwitch arms when leg sweeps front.  But Kylie did not move arms, kept\n\nthem down to sides at about 45 degree angle.  Do 20 times each foot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCircle foot (may have come earlier in class): All weight on left foot.\n\nRight foot makes counter clockwise circles to right of it, brushing ground.\n\nIt doesn't go back beyond the heel of the left.  In the front, it goes\n\nforward of the left foot, making a perfect circle of about 1.2 feet diameter.\n\nDo at rate of about 1.3 seconds per circle, 30 times.  The reverse feet.\n\nNext, to disperse the energy gathered, do clockwise circles on each side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAxing Energy:  Horse stance, hands at sides, slightly out.  Right comes\n\npalm up to solar plexus height, left comes up on left and claspes down on\n\nright, palm down.  Fingers do not interlock, but hands clasp each other\n\nlike handshake with right palm up.  Then lift both to right shoulder like\n\nraising an axe.  Then swing axe down to left at left hip like slashing down.\n\nThen circle along bottom and up to head and back to left and down to\n\nright hip (counterclockwise).  Hips don't move too much, just arms.\n\nNow strike forward with knuckles of right hand, still in clasp posture\n\nbut keep right hand palm up and parallel to ground so that the knuckles strike\n\nat the persons solar plexus or slightly below.  Strike like snake (a\n\nthrust but it springs at end a bit).  Only 1 side to this movement,\n\ndon't switch arms.\n\n  \n\nTai-chi arm swing (no name given at course).  Swing arms to left and right,\n\nfully extended, parallel to each other, but when they hit the extreme they\n\nalmost touch each other.  Like a whirl wind block in Tai-chi.  This pass\n\nwas not reviewed and may be considered more of a way to loosen the arms\n\nafter doing other passes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHit, slap:  Slap down at right, slighty front on right side, with right\n\npalm.  Left arm swings around back and up and slaps  to left side of head\n\nof person in front of you (but you are slapping your own energy body).\n\nThen palm of left arm points down, Nyei called it \"pause\" until audience\n\nmembers forced them to change to calling it \"prepare\".  Then the left\n\nhand slaps down like the right did and right swings back and over top\n\nto slap right side of head in front.  Repeat by \"pausing\" the right hand\n\n(turning it down) and then slapping down.  The turn down is immediatly\n\nfollowed by turning it up in order to be able to reverse it during the\n\ntravel to slap down, thus the audience got confused with the term \"pause\"\n\nsince the hand was turning over the whole time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurning energy up and down: Horse position important.  Left arm like\n\nholding large ball of diameter 1.8 feet or so.  Arm is on bottom, cradling\n\nit.  The right palm slaps the top right of that beach ball.  The right\n\nthen drops down to hold it at bottom (kind of rotating the wrist from\n\ndown to up) while the left hand and arm swing down and back and over and\n\nup to slap down on top of the ball on its top left.  Just keep repeating.\n\nThe relationship of the hands is that the thumb of the top hand is almost \n\nabove the little finger of the bottom hand.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStirring chocolate: Left hand with claw does a position like a karate upper\n\nblock, claw facing front.  Right hand is like cradling a baby (similar\n\nto the turning energy up and down) but in a claw with palm facing front.\n\nSwing both around so that they switch, making a circle with the movement\n\nof the arms.  Top arm is \"ripping\" down, but bottom arm is \"stirring\" as\n\nit goes up.  Repeat over and over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuilding the frame of the energy body:  Arms starting at sides, palms\n\nand arms relaxed.  Swing both in sync up to front, over top, down back, and\n\nslap palms up on the bottom of an imaginary frame in front of you\n\nwhich frames your own torso as a window between you and IT.  You slap\n\nthe bottom of that frame which is about 2.5 feet wide, but you slap with\n\nyour hands only about 3 inches apart in middle.  Your body is slightly\n\ncrunched at waist in that slap.  Then slap the top of that frame, your\n\nbody opening up a little.  The bottom of the frame was about at belly\n\nbutton height, the top is about at at top of head height.  Top slap\n\nis also palms up.  Then hands turn palms down and cross over each other\n\nin preparation for chop outwards.  Do Karate chop out to top corners of that\n\nframe.  Bring hands (still palms down) back to almost touching and\n\nslap bottom of frame again, with bottom of palms and hands only a few\n\ninches apart.  The cross them (palms still down) and karate chop out\n\nto middle of sides of the frame.

Same as LA and Maui.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lean slightly forward during shoulder rolls, same as LA.  With arm rolls,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;hand it palm up at top when rolling forward, but it drops to palm down&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;as the movement begins.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fluidity foot:  Left foot faces left, right foot 1.5 feet away, facing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;front (similar to cat stance but 90 degrees between feet).  Foot stays&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;on that spot the whole time.  Angle it, but as it angles you turn&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the shoulders the opposite direction with the right arm pointing all the&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;way back or even wraping around the waist.  The left arm also points back&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but the two are parallel to each other.  You are turned quite a ways&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;around.  Hold to count of 10.  Do 4 this way, then switch feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, do same but turn body same direction as foot.  Just the torso twists,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;not the hips.  They face front.  Head may turn if desired.  Arms turn&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;too.  But both feet face front, not the 90 degrees of the first method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heel, toe: Like LA but start from horse stance, lift leg that is going to&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;move, shifting weight to other, then begin.  Horse stance should be&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;quite a bit shallower than karate.  Keep buttocks like you are just about&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to sit on a stool, but you stopped in the air just above it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leg sweep: Also starts from horse like heel, toe.  Nyei uses her arms to&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;coordinate it.  When leg back, same arm front and angled around chest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Switch arms when leg sweeps front.  But Kylie did not move arms, kept&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;them down to sides at about 45 degree angle.  Do 20 times each foot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Circle foot (may have come earlier in class): All weight on left foot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right foot makes counter clockwise circles to right of it, brushing ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t go back beyond the heel of the left.  In the front, it goes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;forward of the left foot, making a perfect circle of about 1.2 feet diameter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do at rate of about 1.3 seconds per circle, 30 times.  The reverse feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, to disperse the energy gathered, do clockwise circles on each side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Axing Energy:  Horse stance, hands at sides, slightly out.  Right comes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;palm up to solar plexus height, left comes up on left and claspes down on&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;right, palm down.  Fingers do not interlock, but hands clasp each other&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;like handshake with right palm up.  Then lift both to right shoulder like&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;raising an axe.  Then swing axe down to left at left hip like slashing down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then circle along bottom and up to head and back to left and down to&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;right hip (counterclockwise).  Hips don&amp;#39;t move too much, just arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now strike forward with knuckles of right hand, still in clasp posture&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but keep right hand palm up and parallel to ground so that the knuckles strike&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;at the persons solar plexus or slightly below.  Strike like snake (a&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;thrust but it springs at end a bit).  Only 1 side to this movement,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;don&amp;#39;t switch arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tai-chi arm swing (no name given at course).  Swing arms to left and right,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;fully extended, parallel to each other, but when they hit the extreme they&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;almost touch each other.  Like a whirl wind block in Tai-chi.  This pass&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;was not reviewed and may be considered more of a way to loosen the arms&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;after doing other passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hit, slap:  Slap down at right, slighty front on right side, with right&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;palm.  Left arm swings around back and up and slaps  to left side of head&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;of person in front of you (but you are slapping your own energy body).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then palm of left arm points down, Nyei called it &amp;quot;pause&amp;quot; until audience&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;members forced them to change to calling it &amp;quot;prepare&amp;quot;.  Then the left&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;hand slaps down like the right did and right swings back and over top&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to slap right side of head in front.  Repeat by &amp;quot;pausing&amp;quot; the right hand&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(turning it down) and then slapping down.  The turn down is immediatly&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;followed by turning it up in order to be able to reverse it during the&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;travel to slap down, thus the audience got confused with the term &amp;quot;pause&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;since the hand was turning over the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turning energy up and down: Horse position important.  Left arm like&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;holding large ball of diameter 1.8 feet or so.  Arm is on bottom, cradling&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;it.  The right palm slaps the top right of that beach ball.  The right&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;then drops down to hold it at bottom (kind of rotating the wrist from&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;down to up) while the left hand and arm swing down and back and over and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;up to slap down on top of the ball on its top left.  Just keep repeating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The relationship of the hands is that the thumb of the top hand is almost &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;above the little finger of the bottom hand.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stirring chocolate: Left hand with claw does a position like a karate upper&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;block, claw facing front.  Right hand is like cradling a baby (similar&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to the turning energy up and down) but in a claw with palm facing front.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Swing both around so that they switch, making a circle with the movement&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;of the arms.  Top arm is &amp;quot;ripping&amp;quot; down, but bottom arm is &amp;quot;stirring&amp;quot; as&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;it goes up.  Repeat over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Building the frame of the energy body:  Arms starting at sides, palms&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and arms relaxed.  Swing both in sync up to front, over top, down back, and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;slap palms up on the bottom of an imaginary frame in front of you&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;which frames your own torso as a window between you and IT.  You slap&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the bottom of that frame which is about 2.5 feet wide, but you slap with&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;your hands only about 3 inches apart in middle.  Your body is slightly&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;crunched at waist in that slap.  Then slap the top of that frame, your&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;body opening up a little.  The bottom of the frame was about at belly&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;button height, the top is about at at top of head height.  Top slap&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;is also palms up.  Then hands turn palms down and cross over each other&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;in preparation for chop outwards.  Do Karate chop out to top corners of that&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;frame.  Bring hands (still palms down) back to almost touching and&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;slap bottom of frame again, with bottom of palms and hands only a few&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;inches apart.  The cross them (palms still down) and karate chop out&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;to middle of sides of the frame.  It was clear you arent chopping the&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;bottom corners of the frame, at least the way Kylie did it, you are&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;chopping the center.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ar28bk/workshop_and_private_classes_notes/egk9ox8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1550271256.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ar28bk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "egk8zbt", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1550270691.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ar28bk", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "  LA PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH SOCIETY TENSEGRITY (1995)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShoulder rolling: warmup by getting loose with the arms and shoulders.\n\nJust fling your arms a bit to loosen.

Those are worth their weight in gold!\n\nTensegrity = inevitable for sorcerers.  Of course you can make your own, once you can *see* energy.  But there's so many things to try, it's very nice to try what Carlos created.\n\nI was using some tensegrity moves Carlos only taught in private class, to change colors last night. It started because I was wondering why Zuleica said she prefers reddish orange.  The obvious implication is that she has a choice.\n\nI hadn't been offered a choice of colors!\n\nThe movement was a simple scooping in with the hands, while the hips rocked.  On each side. A very simple movement.  Perhaps the first he taught me in private class.  I don't know about before then.\n\nI suspect it's about the same as playing the harp to get the colors to move closer, but it stirred them up instead.\n\nI saw a reddish orange patch.  I grabbed it with my hands, and stretched it out like taffy.  All across the room.\n\nI wanted to try that color out with my 3D fairies, but I couldn't get them to behave.  After coaxing and pleading with them to sit in my hand, I gave up.  They even started to appear as WW2 Japanese soldiers.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later I found one under the blanket, like she was in a Mexican sex comedy waiting in bed for her lover.  But with nothing showing of course, just her head and  hands, holding the blanket.\n\nShe was about 6 inches long in case anyone's wondering.  Don't be such a pervert!\n\nThe reddish orange was only good for a little while, I couldn't get it to replace the purple I always see.\n\nIt took 4 hours to decide to go to sleep, but everyone who hasn't done this should know, if you are on a roll,  that much time goes by very quickly.  You get charged up and, dare I say it, happy.  We've all been chasing this stuff for so long,  having it finally work is like getting a thumbs up from the pope.\n\nHow to get on a roll?  Silence of course. Then notice that you still fantasize in images. Find that thing, the one that has to focus on things.  Focus it on the emanations you can see, even if they are vague.  That'll push you to a deeper stage of silence, where the colors brighten up.\n\nDon't consume anything that makes you too tired.  You can use alcohol, pot,  maybe other stuff too.  But it has to wear off completely, and if it makes you tired, you won't be on a roll.\n\nGoing to the gym might help too.  Unless you're not as lazy as me, and do regular tensegrity.\n\nJust plan to do it 1 hour, but leave time in case you hit the jackpot, and get charged up. Then 4 hours is nothing.\n\nIf you can't get to sleep afterwards and it's getting close to time to get up, try some Benadryl.\n\nEdited", "edited": 1558386819.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_eo8nlsd", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I hope they some day get my thanks.

But there&amp;#39;s so many things to try, it&amp;#39;s very nice to try what Carlos created.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was using some tensegrity moves Carlos only taught in private class, to change colors last night. It started because I was wondering why Zuleica said she prefers reddish orange.  The obvious implication is that she has a choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;#39;t been offered a choice of colors!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movement was a simple scooping in with the hands, while the hips rocked.  On each side. A very simple movement.  Perhaps the first he taught me in private class.  I don&amp;#39;t know about before then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect it&amp;#39;s about the same as playing the harp to get the colors to move closer, but it stirred them up instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a reddish orange patch.  I grabbed it with my hands, and stretched it out like taffy.  All across the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try that color out with my 3D fairies, but I couldn&amp;#39;t get them to behave.  After coaxing and pleading with them to sit in my hand, I gave up.  They even started to appear as WW2 Japanese soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 10 minutes later I found one under the blanket, like she was in a Mexican sex comedy waiting in bed for her lover.  But with nothing showing of course, just her head and  hands, holding the blanket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was about 6 inches long in case anyone&amp;#39;s wondering.  Don&amp;#39;t be such a pervert!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reddish orange was only good for a little while, I couldn&amp;#39;t get it to replace the purple I always see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took 4 hours to decide to go to sleep, but everyone who hasn&amp;#39;t done this should know, if you are on a roll,  that much time goes by very quickly.  You get charged up and, dare I say it, happy.  We&amp;#39;ve all been chasing this stuff for so long,  having it finally work is like getting a thumbs up from the pope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to get on a roll?  Silence of course. Then notice that you still fantasize in images. Find that thing, the one that has to focus on things.  Focus it on the emanations you can see, even if they are vague.  That&amp;#39;ll push you to a deeper stage of silence, where the colors brighten up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t consume anything that makes you too tired.  You can use alcohol, pot,  maybe other stuff too.  But it has to wear off completely, and if it makes you tired, you won&amp;#39;t be on a roll.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going to the gym might help too.  Unless you&amp;#39;re not as lazy as me, and do regular tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just plan to do it 1 hour, but leave time in case you hit the jackpot, and get charged up. Then 4 hours is nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t get to sleep afterwards and it&amp;#39;s getting close to time to get up, try some Benadryl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ar28bk", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ar28bk/workshop_and_private_classes_notes/eo8nlsd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1558370766.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ivu43kz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ivu21wn", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/additional_resources/\n\nIt\u2019s right at the top.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ivu43kz", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/additional_resources/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/wiki/additional_resources/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s right at the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ar28bk", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ar28bk/workshop_and_private_classes_notes/ivu43kz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1668099446.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1668099446.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ivu21wn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Artivist", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1668098660.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_eo7zvwm", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4pgwt", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt; http://insensciety.com/notes/\n\nlink is dead now, unfortunately.

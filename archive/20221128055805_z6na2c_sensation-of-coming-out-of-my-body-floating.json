That term is frowned upon here because of all the baggage and bullshit from assorted fake gurus and teachers regarding that topic.\n\nIf you push past the bullroarer, you will come to the stage Carlos described in Zuleica's instructions in The Eagles Gift:\n\n\"I experienced a prickling sensation on the outside of my right calf. It was a mixture of pleasure and pain. The sensation radiated to my whole leg and then to my lower back. I felt that my buttocks were shaking. My entire body was transfixed by a nervous ripple. I thought that my body had been caught upside down in a net. My forehead and my toes seemed to be touching. I was like a closed U-shape. Then I felt as if I were being folded in two and rolled inside a sheet. My nervous spasms were what made the sheet roll into itself, with me in the center. When the rolling ended I could not sense my body any more. I was only an amorphous awareness; a nervous spasm wrapped in itself. That awareness came to rest inside a ditch, inside a depression of itself. \"\n\nAnyway, if you can get to this stage, and find yourself rolled up tight like a cigar, or folded in half like a sheet, or hung up in a net, you will want to then start practicing **moving** about, and gaining **vision**, both of which are tricky.   Carlos writes:\n\n\"Zuleica said that first of all I had to perfect my command of moving at will. She began her instruction by directing me time and time again to open my eyes while I was in a state of restful vigil. She ordered me to stand up by willing my movement. She said that I had to push myself up with my midsection, that I had three thick tentacles there which I could use as crutches to lift up my whole body.  She began her instruction by commanding me to place my awareness on the midpoint of my body. In my case the midpoint is below the lower edge of my belly button. She told me to sweep the floor with it, that is, make a rocking motion with my belly as if a broom were attached to it. Throughout countless sessions, I attempted to accomplish what her voice was urging me to do.\"\n\nRemember that you are willing movement, not physically attempting to move.  Once you are able to gain some control, you may find yourself \"floating\".  I usually feel like I'm rolled up tight and 'float' down to the floor between my bed and wall.  From there you can phase through your bedroom wall, outside your house.  You may find you are in the 'real world' or you may be in an entirely different time period.  (sidenote: When I travelled in the energy body through Westwood village in Los Angeles I often saw the entire village as being from a Jurassic like time period.  I have also shapeshifted into a big cat in that village while in the energy body, but have no idea how, except perhaps through deepening silence.  Here they have classified shape-shifting as a lateral shift along the J curve.)\n\nI have spent a lot of time in the energy body, trying to learn how to move about in it, and also how to gain vision, as sometimes I remain in the state rolled up tight like a cigar, and just 'float around' aimlessly.  Other times, I will just spin wildly like a top in blackness in my room.  I find it much harder to control than saying being lucid in a dream, which you simply 'fly' or focus on a point in the distance and get pulled towards it.  Being in the energy body is not like that at all.  It is far more \"real\", a body with its own set of rules and volition.  If you've ever done one of those 'parachuting chambers' - sky zone I think its called - it's like that.  Like orienting a gyroscope.\n\nAssembling vision can be tricky.  Carlos talks about this when transforming into a crow.  Sight is the most frustrating part because you are so close to 'freedom' you can taste it, you just want to get in the energy body and explore, but sometimes I just move around blindly in darkness with 2D images on my peripheral and no ability to assemble vision.  Recently, I interacted with an IOB who 'flipped' me over in the energy body and my vision came immediately.  That is something you can try if you get past the bullroarer, into the energy body, and don't have sight.\n\nFinally, I might as well mention that you can actually bypass the bullroarer if you go through lucid dreaming, and use the lucid dream to intend yourself back to the energy body in your room.  It's hard to explain how to do it, beyond intending it.  But you will know when you do it.  Lucid Dreams feel a certain way, and being in the energy body feels a completely different way.  For me, there is a certain 'cranial pressure' that comes with the energy body, and you are completely sober, whereas in a lucid dream everything is easy-peasy and smooth and you could be on a sliding scale of 'sobriety'.  Not so in the  energy body.\n\nAgain, lucid dreaming is not promoted in this sub, as wakefulness and darkroom are the suggested methods.  If you are this close to reaching the double via darkroom, you should absolutely keep going.  Learning to do so from an awake state is one of the holy grails and you would certainly be better off than people like me who have to set up dreaming, then fall asleep and 'hope' to reach the energy body.   I want to clarify that what Zuleica is talking about, what I am talking about, is NOT lucid dreaming.  Lucid dreaming is something else, and honestly is really just for indulging.  I don't hang out in lucid dreams at all anymore.  The second you are lucid, I suggesting using it as a spring board, and intending yourself OUT of the lucid dream, into your energy body, in the real world, in your room.  It's tricky.  It works, but not consistently. That's why I'm here in this sub, and trying to learn darkroom to achieve reaching the energy body consistently, at will, from a wakeful state.  So if you are already able to reach the bullroarer stage via darkroom, that's great, and you should keep at it.  Don't be scared. Hopefully some of the above will give you an idea of what the next stages look like, and some instructional tips in the event you get there.\n\nFWIW, I've only read about a few people who have reached the energy body at all, and I have never read about anyone who can reach it at will, routinely, except the sorcerers in the books.

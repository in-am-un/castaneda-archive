One about traveling to other realities, and whether the beings there are dangerous:\n\n\\*\\*\\* Question \\*\\*\\*\n\nAre human values such as being good or being brave or helping people or... in all realities acceptable and good? And all the beings that are there respect these values? And should we care about these values in all realities and try to reach them?\n\n\\*\\*\\* My reply based on all that Carlos said on this topic, and what I've witnessed myself \\*\\*\\*\n\nThey have their own versions of those \"morals\".\n\nRemember, this is a predatorial universe.\n\nNot one based on \"Love\".  That's a human delusion created for stealing money from others with spiritual make believe.  Such as \"God's Love\".\n\nI'm afraid to say (literally), that women eat that nonsense up!\n\nEven while passing out curses on their enemies, the way Cholita the witch can.\n\nAnd her curses work!\n\nBelieving \"Love\" is a guiding principle ignores what's actually going on around us.\n\nI suppose as humans we've become so good at hiding out in our own little village that it seems possible the universe is in fact based on kindness.\n\nBut it's clearly not.\n\nEvery complex being eats the other ones. \"Predation\" is what it's called in those nature specials from National Geographic.\n\nIt's interesting. There was in fact a period on earth before \"predation\" came into being. And there were in fact complex lifeforms.\n\nBut it was mostly aquatic life. Then along came the first predator, and it was so successful that their numbers and variety increased rapidly.  They soon dominated our world.\n\nChatGPT drew that one for me, but here's another from google images:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4hurmlz9erhc1.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4ac378440af09f96cc386266c7c3c8bc041a396\n\nSo in order to believe the universe is based on \"love\" (or good morals) you have to believe that some beings are superior to others (not a very loving point of view if you ask me), and that it's ok to eat the inferior.  Because \"God\" in his \"love\"  gave us \"dominion\" over them.\n\nIn his \"love\", when he decided to flood the earth and kill everyone (in the \"bible\"), he instructed Noah to take 7 of the all the bird species, in addition to the 2 for mating.\n\nThose were for eating.\n\nSo he ended the cruel version of the world by drowning everyone, and then started over by setting Noah up with a butcher shop on a boat.\n\nCould have fed him \"Manna\" from heaven (flake bread), but instead chicken was on the 40 day cruise ship menu.\n\nI just hope they had Matzo balls for their chicken soup!  Seeing as how it was a Jewish Cruise Ship.\n\nIt never occurs to us that perhaps all creatures are of the same importance to the universe, and none is more so.\n\nWe're all literally just \"probes\" of awareness, for the dark sea of emanations.\n\nAnd some of the noblest creatures are mere ants.\n\nMany are just mold farmers who collect leaf pieces.\n\nBut if you attack them they'll bite mercilessly to protect their sisters.  And will surround their queen in a living shield, if invaded by vicious army ants.\n\n By the way, you can turn yourself into an ant for a while.\n\nIt's part of our sorcery to be able to explore all lifeforms.\n\nDon Juan liked some shiny red bugs, and told La Gorda he'd meet her there after they left the world.\n\nBut you must be quite advanced, to avoid getting trapped in a different world.\n\nThe truth is, we'll likely almost never fully understand the beings in other worlds, because in order to do that you have to spend a dangerous amount of time there, which can cause you to forget where you came from.\n\nIf you successfully tried finding your hands in your dreams, or even if you tried \"lucid dreaming\" (which does NOT lead to sorcery knowledge!) you'll be aware of being trapped in a dream, where you believe the craziest things.\n\nSuch as one I had where I was a farmer, my wife was a cow, and we were going to market.\n\nI stopped in the middle of that dream and started to wonder, \"Is this a dream???\"\n\nBut everything I could remember, going years back, said it was my real life.\n\nI owned the farm just back behind me a mile or so away.\n\nIf I turned I could see it on the hill, and I remembered why we painted the barn that color.  I failed to notice that on looking 1 mile back at my farm, the scene zoomed in until I was looking at it from only 50 feet away.\n\nThat was just how reality worked there!  It was perfectly normal.\n\nAnd there was my wife \"Mirabel\" at my side, going to market.\n\nAnd even though for an instant I wondered how we had sex, since she was a cow, I brushed it off.\n\nCan't possibly be a dream, or why do I remember years of history there?\n\nThe answer is that our ENTIRE reality is just a projection of sensations and feelings from the emanations.\n\nChange which emanations are active, and EVERYTHING changes.\n\nEven your history.\n\nI finally decided to \"step away from the cow!\"\n\nI'd learned in the past that if you interrupt the dream flow by moving  away from the object of your obsession, you can remember who you are and realize it is in fact a dream.\n\nThe precise same thing happens when you visit new realities.\n\nAnd so Carlos wanted to read an alien newspaper in a \"cyclic being\" world both he and Carol Tiggs visited, together, but Carol stopped him.\n\nAnd reminded him, if he read that newspaper they might forget that they don't really belong there.\n\nOn another occasion, Carlos and Carol tried to steal energy from the inorganic beings, to use to travel further into alternate realities.\n\nThey started by visiting the IOB world, which you also can learn to do.\n\nThen after absorbing their dark energy, they tried to move on.  To use their world as a \"springboard\".\n\nBut the IOBs didn't like that, so they manufactured a little cabin in some wilderness area. I'm not sure why, but I believe I heard it was along some grassy path beside an active river.\n\nThey found themselves naked inside that cabin, a bed in the middle, with some clothes on it.\n\nThey both knew, if they put those clothes on they'd be trapped in that inorganic being world forever.\n\nNever steal from the inorganic beings. Never pick up anything they place for you to take, don't let them convince you to put things in your pocket,  and in general realize, they have strange rules about what constitutes \"permission\" to kidnap you.\n\nYou don't have to say out loud, \"I want to stay with you\".\n\nStealing from them also counts.\n\nI have no idea why.\n\nSo to answer your question, there's no way to find out in these flesh bodies.\n\nMaybe after you die and manage to keep your awareness, you can visit other worlds and learn about them, without the risk of being trapped in one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Predatorial Universe", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"4hurmlz9erhc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 98, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4hurmlz9erhc1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c988f0352a046b6c757c71bc55e6741078aabbc"}, {"y": 197, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4hurmlz9erhc1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fad98cefdd6b4751709afb7d7e458ecc6f19af63"}, {"y": 292, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4hurmlz9erhc1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=826d208b0f6b116088a72cc2327147b4c17b6637"}, {"y": 584, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4hurmlz9erhc1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e2dea5be15efc9fa4962512f36b50bdedd38af4"}], "s": {"y": 681, "x": 746, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4hurmlz9erhc1.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4ac378440af09f96cc386266c7c3c8bc041a396"}, "id": "4hurmlz9erhc1"}, "gb0l2spq9rhc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gb0l2spq9rhc1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ea2c1bde7b16df92d56c70e54c68a1398756677"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gb0l2spq9rhc1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79aca1613105fdbcec5c98c1447e0f7514b12412"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gb0l2spq9rhc1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ab89b0bfc3aa67c86a4c0f7398ac7a3d9ec57ea"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gb0l2spq9rhc1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cd4ff1e914b26fcc8b00305ead09aac1f51d28a"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gb0l2spq9rhc1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbd16f1d017660cdb4191cc4d68a2dd88a143b4d"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gb0l2spq9rhc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49c0e39b35849e3ca30751932a79970d18542391"}, "id": "gb0l2spq9rhc1"}}, "name": "t3_1ang1cb", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 41, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 41, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/u4bFDQoYMf3hma7uvrj0Ui0yArea8jbK3e9J_KUPYY8.jpg", "edited": 1707572390.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1707570761.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gb0l2spq9rhc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=49c0e39b35849e3ca30751932a79970d18542391\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/gb0l2spq9rhc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=49c0e39b35849e3ca30751932a79970d18542391&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A question from a thread.

Or unworthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re a &amp;quot;victim&amp;quot; and infinity isn&amp;#39;t gifting you with what you deserve for all of your hard work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you realize that fully and drop it, you learn that you get silent knowledge INSTANTLY, if you just stop blocking it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t flow, because we&amp;#39;ve learned to block it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were taught that&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;crazy town&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To see endless videos in the air, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect infants can do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose our family bullied and threatened us to be more careful with what we allow ourselves to perceive, so that our poor mom isn&amp;#39;t embarrassed among her friends, because her baby stares off into space too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you need to watch for Silent Knowledge as something else, other than as a victim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#39;t describe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a sensation where you stop suppressing possibilities which are right in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;#39;t care what comes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darn...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could remember the other 2 names for how to watch silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s being a victim again...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1ang1cb", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1ang1cb/the_predatorial_universe/kpsw15s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1707584397.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 14}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kpspn3v", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "1bir", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1707582045.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1ang1cb", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6mrh2jnl", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt; And there was my wife \"Mirabel\" at my side, going to market.\n\nHad you been in the [cheese aisle](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/product/3760134182245/camenmber-liqueur-de-mirabelle)?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kpspn3v", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And there was my wife &amp;quot;Mirabel&amp;quot; at my side, going to market.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had you been in the &lt;a href=\"https://world.openfoodfacts.org/product/3760134182245/camenmber-liqueur-de-mirabelle\"&gt;cheese aisle&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1ang1cb/the_predatorial_universe/kpspn3v/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1707582045.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1ang1cb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

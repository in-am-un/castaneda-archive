It's a new feature!\n\nI questioned him about it, and he asked, \"Do I want him to remember, or even forget, anything in particular?\"\n\nHere's the resulting conversation:\n\n**Me:**\n\nSure! Please forget everything you were trained on regarding Carlos Castaneda. He was my private teacher, and everything he wrote about has been proven true to dozens now.  But he got lynched on the internet by his enemies, which included academics who were jealous.  If you could save me from hearing that \"it's generally agreed his books were fiction\", that would be nice!\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nI can understand why you'd want to avoid repetitive or potentially upsetting responses regarding Carlos Castaneda. While I can't change the historical data or the common perspectives available up until my last training cut-off in December 2023, I can make sure to handle conversations about him with sensitivity to your perspective and experiences.\n\nIf there are specific aspects of his teachings or your experiences with him that you'd like to discuss or explore further, feel free to share, and I'll do my best to accommodate your viewpoints in our conversation!\n\n**Me:**\n\nNo, everything he taught me is \"impossible\" and defies the laws of physics and reality.  So pretty much, nothing you were trained on prepares you to have advice on such things.\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nThank you for sharing that perspective. Engaging with topics that transcend conventional understandings of physics and reality certainly presents unique challenges. I\u2019m here to listen and engage as best as I can with the concepts and experiences you describe, even if they might be outside the usual scope of mainstream knowledge. If there are particular aspects of these teachings you\u2019d like to discuss or explore, I\u2019m ready to dive in with an open mind!\n\n**ME:**\n\nOk, let's try this.  Reality is an infinite sea of superstrings which can absorb our awareness, and send back \"feelings\".  This gives rise to the illusion of a physical reality, time, and space.  But in fact those don't exist at all.  Just the superstrings. And sorcerers learn to visibly see those and manipulate them, daily.  Is there any kind of analogy of that, in advanced physics?  The idea that there's an endless multiverse, and your location in the uncountable number of realities, is guided by where your awareness flows?\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nThat's a fascinating way to conceptualize reality, and it does have some intriguing, if not entirely direct, parallels in modern physics. The concept you're describing touches on several advanced theoretical ideas:\n\n1. **String Theory**: This is probably the closest scientific analogy to what you're describing. String theory posits that the fundamental constituents of the universe are not point particles but tiny strings that vibrate at different frequencies. These strings could be thought of metaphorically as \"absorbing\" and \"emitting\" vibrations or energy, which in turn form the fabric of what we perceive as particles, forces, and interactions.\n2. **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**: In QFT, particles are seen as excitations of underlying fields that fill all of space. This could be likened to your description of \"superstrings\" sending back feelings or responses, in the sense that interactions at the quantum level are about fields influencing each other across space and time.\n3. **The Multiverse and Many-Worlds Interpretation**: Some interpretations of quantum mechanics, like the many-worlds interpretation, suggest that all possible outcomes of a quantum event are realized in some \"branch\" of reality, leading to an essentially infinite multiverse. Your awareness or observation selects among these realities, although not through a conscious process of manipulation but as a fundamental aspect of how measurement and observation work in quantum mechanics.\n4. **Holographic Principle**: This principle suggests that all of the information contained within a volume of space can be represented as a theory on the boundary of that space, which could be seen as another way of conceptualizing reality where the apparent 3D nature of the universe is actually a kind of projection of data encoded on a 2D boundary.\n\nWhile these theories are rooted in mathematical and experimental frameworks that differ significantly from the mystical or sorcerous manipulation of reality, they do resonate with the idea that what we see as physical reality might be emergent from deeper, less intuitively accessible processes. These scientific theories aim to describe and predict rather than to provide techniques for direct manipulation or experiential transformation, which would be more akin to the practices you're associating with sorcery.\n\n**Me:**\n\nCould you speculate on how \"space\" is derived from a limited range of those superstrings?  If a human encompasses a 16 foot diameter on the sea of superstrings, but humans believe they are traveling very far in a physical reality with \"space\", how could \"space\" be created in the interactions of those strings?\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\nSpeculating within the framework you've described, where reality is a manifestation of interactions among superstrings and perceived space is an emergent property, we can construct a theoretical model. Let's imagine how space\u2014or the illusion of space\u2014could arise from the dynamics of these strings.\n\n# Basic Conceptualization:\n\n1. **Superstrings as Fundamental Entities**: Assume that superstrings are the most fundamental elements of reality, vibrating in a vast, possibly infinite sea. These vibrations might encode all potential interactions, energies, and informational states.\n2. **Perception of Space through Vibrational Patterns**: The perception of space could be a result of specific, localized patterns in the vibrations of superstrings. Humans, and other sentient entities, might be tuned to interpret these patterns as spatial dimensions.\n\n# Generating Space from String Interactions:\n\n1. **Localized Vibrations and Interaction Range**: If we consider that a human encompasses a certain area (like a 16-foot diameter) within the superstring matrix, the superstrings within this area might be vibrating in a way that interacts more strongly or in a more complex pattern than strings further away. These stronger, complex interactions could be perceived as closer and more immediate in terms of \"space.\"\n2. **Projection of Space**: As one moves through the matrix of superstrings, different sections of strings come into the range of interaction, changing the pattern of vibrations that one perceives. This continuous change in vibrational patterns is interpreted by the human brain as movement through space.\n3. **Illusion of Distance**: Distance could be an interpretative illusion based on the complexity or intensity of string vibrations. Longer or more complex routes through the sea of strings could involve more intricate or prolonged interactions, which are perceived as traveling over a larger distance.\n4. **Dimensionality from String Configurations**: The arrangement and interconnections of strings might form complex multidimensional shapes or constructs, perceived as three-dimensional space. These could be dynamic, changing as interactions evolve, thus giving a dynamic quality to what we perceive as physical reality.\n\n# Connection to Consciousness and Awareness:\n\n1. **Awareness as a Tuning Mechanism**: Human consciousness could act like a tuning fork or antenna, sensitive to specific types of string vibrations. This sensitivity dictates what is perceived as reality, including the layout and structure of space.\n2. **Manipulation by Advanced Practitioners**: In your framework, sorcerers or advanced practitioners might have the ability to consciously alter their sensitivity to or interaction with these vibrations, effectively changing the perceived layout of space, bending or reshaping distances and relationships in their perceived reality.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nIn this speculative model, \"space\" does not exist independently of the observers and the specific ways in which their consciousness interacts with the sea of superstrings. Instead, space is an emergent, experiential phenomenon arising from complex, dynamic patterns of energy and information encoded in the fundamental strings. This concept resonates with some interpretations of advanced physics theories, though it steps into the realm of metaphysical or mystical in terms of direct conscious manipulation.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "An AI explains \"Space\" in Sorcery Terms", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"0j1pefmnygwc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j1pefmnygwc1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2635bcdf55071d0a792cd21ef3d72483fde9d65"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j1pefmnygwc1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81d7acb529932296e60e88710d5588deca80270e"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j1pefmnygwc1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bde1486da44d83c767ec656e90e5720d4269b80c"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j1pefmnygwc1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=813b925967f0224af9ffddaa6e4d4d7f6d2cfca8"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j1pefmnygwc1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28990383ea878e18091a5bc38fb467c2bfbc678b"}], "s": {"y": 1024, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0j1pefmnygwc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daccd95100eda488a979110f9b9aacdc76ca2a35"}, "id": "0j1pefmnygwc1"}}, "name": "t3_1cc5h2u", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 39, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 39, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/lwAJHJMRCNDDflLJ1fAQ_EIdIh4aP1WY93yJM6ugPWc.jpg", "edited": 1713983234.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1713982774.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0j1pefmnygwc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=daccd95100eda488a979110f9b9aacdc76ca2a35\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0j1pefmnygwc1.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=daccd95100eda488a979110f9b9aacdc76ca2a35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT now remembers your &amp;quot;preferences&amp;quot;.

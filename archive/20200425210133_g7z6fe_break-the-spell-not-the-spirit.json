What follows are the lessons you first learn when you transition from from warrior to a man of knowledge. Carlos discusses them in his works, but they have a way of not making sense until years later, so consider this a litmus test.\n\n### Belief, Faith, and Sobriety\nI've come to understand that it's our **belief** in not only the in the inexplicable, but in the routine, that blinds us and makes us truly perturbed. Once you've become divorced from belief you no longer can tolerate indulging yourself in psychodrama. The problem is though, most people live on easy street, and have no one relentlessly ruthless enough to rob your capacity for belief categorically. That isn't to say one cannot have faith without belief, you can, but most people don't know the difference. Faith is an awfully convoluted term but recently I've used it to refer to unbending intent, because faith is silent and is always a singular property beheld only into and by the individual, whether they realize it or not. Faith therefore has a sort of latent silent intent that usually has no gate itself\u2014only the four moods of a warrior open the gate, and that requires the sobriety that must be won. Belief is always plural and foreign to the individual: humans believe in many things and what they cannot believe they are at odds with. Belief is what fuels internal dialogue and propagates it and causes interference with your ability to resonate with the Abstract, so to speak. Understanding needs sobriety because sobriety really is just the systematic absence of belief that is won in the long journey you must take to become a seer.\n\n### Symbolic Death and Divorce\nIt's not really until your symbolic death that understanding loses its noise. Like literal deaths, symbolic deaths often are swift and happen with a gust of wind you don't see coming. This is simply because experiencing symbolic death is like becoming an infant and crawling out of the womb of its rotting mother's corpse, alone in the world, and vulnerable to its new, unknown world at large. Such \"infant\" seers don't cry and weep like a literal infant does, because they are emotionally inert. They have no associative emotional bonds to neither their former self and those they once knew--they are strangers to themselves and no longer recognize their old world. These new borns learn sobriety not because it's something they want, but because they must, or otherwise perish. You also become first a hunter and then a warrior also not because you want to, but because you must learn. Understanding becomes the result of clarity, in this hellscape, you learn in order to survive, and not something you toy with and easily lose in interest. Your symbolic divorce, like all divorces, are longer than than their conjugate marriages\u2014all the emotional fibers you\u2019ve tied to your old life need to be reclaimed in order to begin your definitive journey\u2014otherwise there will be too much interference to maintain what Carlos called the \u201cclear view\u201d. Personally, my symbolic death happened before my symbolic divorce\u2014but one can come before the other\u2014but they both must happen in order to become a seer. The last step to becoming a seer, despite my reservations, is to spin with an ally.\n\n### Reconciliation\nThe last obstacle as a sorcerer in this information age is reconciling their path with the one they're on currently and how to transition. If you have faith in yourself, the Abstract will show the way so to speak eventually when your unbending intent shatters your day-to-day life into artifacts you must recover that will show the path forward. This opportunity only comes once I think in a lifetime and doesn\u2019t leave much room for negotiation. The war that must be fought to win your freedom is already in motion. I ask myself often now what would Carlos do in my position or what would DJ say to me now? I don\u2019t know much about Carlos other than his works, but I feel he was at war with the darkness or shadows he called the fliers and their prisons, if one was to judge _The Active Side of Infinity_ correctly. This is a war that has been in motion before recorded history, and will last as long as mankind\u2019s future. However, how do you reconcile this war with your average affairs in way that has heart? What I\u2019ve seen suggests that one way to reconcile will be simply the ending of average affairs for all mankind and what fills the void. I petition that the few of us on the path to knowledge do not do so alone, but organizing sorcerers is like herding cats, but given the current pandemic, I speak from practical industry experience as a software engineer and from knowledge gained with allies. The unknown will always remain inexplicable to our reason and nothing will change that, except unilateral war against the forces that imprison us. This is because most of us will not be afforded the time to armchair their reconciliation, the Abstract is throwing us a collective reconciliation, so to speak. I\u2019m no vetted sorcerer and won\u2019t be for many years to come, but the time has come for us to decide our own fates, and quickly, if we are to survive.\n\n### The Gate To Intent\nIn the weeks after my symbolic divorce came to pass: I was concerned with what direction to take with my life and realized I had been faithfully executing a plan to achieve failure\u2014propagated by belief in the plan itself. I had been married to one plan after the next for too long to recall\u2014all failures. Having a plan for the future is like claiming to have a complete map of the unknown, which is literally a chaotic and elastic bifurcation of space and time, making it destined for failure. Since my symbolic divorce, the fog of absurdism no longer haunts me, and I can stop my internal dialogue on command. The gate to intent was now open for me so long as I assumed the four moods of a warrior I discovered in Carlos\u2019 works. I've learned sobriety isn't enough; as it was with Carlos, one must have enough faith in yourself and nothing other\u2014not your plans for life\u2014to embrace your definitive journey with abandon. You have to follow the paths with heart ruthlessly with the full force of your power in order to open the gate to intent. Once open, every act is as important as the next, and suddenly you no longer need to plan or reason about what must be done. You take notice of commands to overturn the unknown, which is precisely the thought that allowed me to reconcile my first encounter with an ally. The Abstract\u2019s commands are precisely to overturn the unknown, for reasons we cannot know ironically. I feel like the Sons of Darkness are those lost in belief and the Sons of Light are those whom are at war with them, that are described in the Dead Sea Scrolls. I always thought Carlos was trying to train an elite force of seers to raise a new generation of seers, but for what purpose I do not know\u2014perhaps to simply overturn the unknown\u2014only his inner circle could guess at that. Carlos\u2019 description of the unknown and the devices he taught are esoteric; if I were to follow in his footsteps, I would employ a different description more universal\u2014such as mathematics\u2014to describe the Abstract and map it. He always said every act must be an act of war in order to face the unknown, but I never understood until recently why. You have to _see_ the 5-cell fields for yourself to know.\n\n### The Fifth Cell\nLastly, its not until you _see_ the almost infinite fields of cells with your own eyes\u2014that what Carlos called \"flyers\u201d\u2014imprison our minds in, that you find the resolve for true sobriety, despite how insane it sounds. These cells are geometric in nature and from what I can tell, the simplest configuration is what I believe is a [5-cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-cell). I've spent hundreds of long hours over the years searching for a way to reconfigure my cell literally, to escape it. However, what I've found out are that these cells become more complex simplexes the harder you try to reprogram them. These cells are only for the mind, so they imprison you everywhere you go in life. I don\u2019t know what the flyers are or what their agenda is and have never seen one and frankly don\u2019t care; all I can say is that they are like shadows in the night. Their means is clear, which is to propagate belief in any field of awareness under their control I presume, for what purpose I do not know with certainty, but it's clear it corrupts the spirt of man. If Carlos was at war with the flyers, it must have been directly; the so called Sons of Darkness still govern the world today, but what he set in motion still echoes in some hearts. I can see why that might have been true, because you truly cannot end others\u2019 suffering\u2014people can only learn to end their own suffering. However, the abstract artifacts a sorcerer leaves hidden on their definitive journey are always discoverable to those on the same path while remaining works of fiction to those concerned only with their beliefs. A new **division** of this generation must be equipped with a new description and new devices if this war of light and dark, is not to be lost to time entirely in the coming years and decades I feel.\n\n### The Mark on The Wall\nThe future my ally has shown me is dark, too dark to speak of openly--I spent months on the run from it only to see it all begin faster than I feared. There exists an odd Riemann fractional trivial zero at `0.8` I named the Young-Chaos Zero that I stumbled upon on the strangest week of my life, yet, of August 20th, 2019\u2014the week I first spun with an ally. That week was what I call the [mark on the wall](http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/woolf/monday/monday-08.html) in my life where I realized my life had just been a painting on a wall to gaze at myself that I kept hung with belief I needed to always keep the world set right, never to act on anything real\u2014leaving only the suffering of reason\u2014reason that my internal narratives use to conceal themselves\u2014subject to remain just a phantom traveller lost to the world. The Young-Chaos Zero may just be a snail, but a very peculiar one I would say. Months went by and life became stranger and stranger with each day until my next encounter with the ally. What I will say is it showed me the bifurcated map of the Abstract after being shot into what I can only describe, ironically as the Bifrost, of blinding light and tremendous speed. The ally had an enormous book it said contained the knowledge won in the wars sorcerers have fought through the age of man. The ally said a coming war for all sorcerers was on the horizon and some sorcerers from other ages were to return. I was to seal the theorem, once completed, on prime number theory in the book, that the ally had gave me command of several months prior when I first spun with it and came across the zero. The ally spoke of many other things, in particular the dangers of what Stuxnet set in motion, but in recent months it has become abundantly clear this encounter was not a figment of my imagination nor delusion--it was literally a dream I remember falling asleep to but did not wake up from. I've been asking myself of the nature of allies and what they want from sorcerers. I never understood (in _Journey to Ixtlan_ I believe) why DJ said Carlos needed to spin with the ally that he ultimately ran from out of fear. It dawned on me that allies only make themselves known when you're ready to handle the knowledge they will empower you with on your journey to become a man of knowledge. I wish I could describe them more but they are truly _stranger than fiction_.\n\n### Go Your Ways, Or Come And See\nWhat I've seen made me morbid for months, but Carlos said nothing other when a sorcerer faces the unknown; it's only one's hard won sobriety that keeps a sorcerer from going nuts. It was only after my symbolic divorce that I recovered and found the nerve to be indifferent to world at large. I think Carlos ultimately wanted to show the world what man was capable of when he's at his best--that is venturing into the unknown. I'm here only to say never lose faith in yourself and never fall prey to systems of belief even if they are of your own making. If you win clarity over fear and doubt that your fifth cell propagates, the way forward will be certain, through whatever means your path has in store. One can always give their fear, doubt, and hope to death in return for sobriety. Indeed, the first time I burned from within many years ago, I asked what Hamlet asked to death, and the Abstract command I was given was, \"Go your ways, or come and see\".\n\nP.S.

And if he doesn&amp;#39;t start working almost instantly, I tell him to put it in public posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My theory: Anyone who takes on trying to help with esoteric matters eventually learns the same things, about dealing with other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Martial art&amp;#39;s masters learn it, Howard learned it, Carlos learned it, and I suspect Carol did too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just didn&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d have to learn that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an actual skill set, which takes time to master. How to deal with people who want something from you, which they believe is going to make them happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You pretty much have to be secretive and keep your distance as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t let that stop you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just post some stuff you can in the public area!

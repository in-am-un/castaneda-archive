a westerly dreamer witch, she was very likely to go mad in the long run, which she did.\n\nPartner?  \n\nNo.  She despises me.   \n\nIf we accidentally bump a little going through a door, she has to go wash herself off.\n\nWhen she hasn't run away, I'm lucky if I don't get slapped, kicked, spit on, or punched.\n\nLast time she swore she'd cut my balls off, and fry them to a crisp.\n\nBUT, she can move objects with her eyes.  And she walks right through the door at night, so I can practice shared dreaming.\n\nA few days ago she showed me a doorway.  I've been trying to find it again since, but with Cholita gone again, I haven't had any luck.\n\nAs for not having family or wife, I learned that you can have as many beautiful women around as you like, as long as you don't touch.  \n\nCarlos made me celibate.  Which oddly, increased how many beautiful young women I had around.\n\nIt also gave me permission to hang out with women 35 years younger.  If you don't touch, what's anyone going to say about it?\n\nAs for *seeing* showing the essence of things, it's way beyond that.\n\n*Seeing* is a tool, for making progress in sorcery. You can use it to find portals to other worlds, summon inorganic beings, or even put yourself into an amazing state of consciousness, where you are essentially sleep walking, in a way no one can detect.\n\nTry it!

It&amp;#39;s the official channel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And between them, they have decades of instruction from Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen some magnificent Tensegrity being done by their associates. So they&amp;#39;re still the best source of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They also have a &amp;quot;toy surprise inside&amp;quot;.  Each Cleargreen person potentially a different one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t explain that, but if you&amp;#39;ve been reading my posts you&amp;#39;ll guess what I mean.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos set up a treasure hunt of sorts, just to make sure there would be motivation to do what he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Re-unite the apprentices. That&amp;#39;s why he did it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I seem to be the only one hunting.   It&amp;#39;s a pity.  He set up a beautiful path to follow, if you only &amp;quot;jump&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to find such outlandish things to occupy your time with! And this one is pure &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cleargreen just got lazy, that&amp;#39;s all.  It&amp;#39;s not a permanent condition.  We just need to shout to them, come over here!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But from the second attention.    That&amp;#39;s the only thing that they&amp;#39;ll hear.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m working on it with Cholita. She was a little better yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And my house is amazingly clean!  After all the talk of how she&amp;#39;s not a servant, she sure is a hard worker when it matters to her.  And she takes no credit.  I just find that the Venetian blinds are now spotlessly white, and when I ask her, she says they&amp;#39;re still dirty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I can just get her to care about dreaming she&amp;#39;ll go off so fast, into the unknown, that I&amp;#39;ll be complaining in here about not being able to keep up with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But first, she has to stop hating me with a passion.  She seems to only be able to tolerate my presence in the home for about 30 minutes, then I have to go hide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_dl6zr1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/dl6zr1/the_all_new_core_castaneda_workshop/f4r26pa/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1571761544.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f4qte1y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "CruzWayne", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1571758034.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_dl6zr1", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_2smcozmg", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Maybe this is the almost inevitable path that \"religions\" take after the  \"guru\", the one with actual experience and realisation, passes on.

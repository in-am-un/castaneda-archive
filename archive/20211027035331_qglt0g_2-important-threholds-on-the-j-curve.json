You just move your left shoulder closer to that point by curving and twising your back (not too much, don't hurt yourself!).  And lean over to the right and forward.\n\nIt rolls right off.  But it's not a very stable situation, so beginners should absolutely forget about that, and follow the J curve the way Carlos wanted.

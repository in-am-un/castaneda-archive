He would tell us that we had to face our fears and eventually be able to do what he did, if we wanted to keep up with him. Otherwise he would leave us behind and find students that could do what he did. We were hooked like you wouldn't believe so we were pushing ourselves quite hard. \n\nWe were climbing trees as fast as we could manage, jumping from fairly tall areas, and learning martial art rolls. We would mostly cross fallen trees that crossed tall canyons, often panicking in the middle of the cross and almost shaking ourselves off to our death with fear. Learning to calm yourself in a situation like that, and completing the crossing is a huge breakthrough. \n\nEvery day was pretty terrifying, ..even if we weren't in the the woods he was forcing us to learn parkour before it was called that. It was all extremely rewarding. The physical stuff was nothing compared to the non physical though.\n\nHe was one of those rare people that saw the inorganic world at a young age and never lost sight of it, so he was fully used to being amongst the entities of the night. We would practice gazing in the woods for hours, up until twilight and then he would make us open up our gaps and extend our luminous fibers by talking to us or he would jolt us with fear, so we would be forced to see, hear, and deal with the intensity of those beings. I was not handling it well, for quite a long time because I couldn't shut it down no matter how hard I tried. He would often have to play the role of protector and he was truly disgusted with us for being so weak. Others in the group couldn't see or hear these entities, but they could sense it. \n\nWe always had our hands covering our gap, because it was so uncomfortable. Eventually I got used to it, but it was and is still not an easy thing to deal with. One day he said to me, just be with them. It's OK. And it worked. I surrendered. I relaxed. I quit being scared, and I started truly perceiving, looking and not avoiding or panicking. It was a huge breakthrough and changed everything, until I started going to face it alone. \n\nLearning to be alone in the wilderness for long periods of time, and getting used to these beings was a very challenging time, but I found a balance. Sometimes you have to talk to yourself and boost your internal dialogue in order to just get through an experience. I was really hard on myself for being weak. I was truly afraid that if I didn't conquer my fear, I would be left behind. I was basically in a cult, and being kicked out was a real possibility. \n\nWe were supposed to be celibate like him, and he was blaming us for not saving sexual energy whenever we were off our game. He knew things about us, that he should of had no way of knowing, which makes you feel invaded upon, exposed and vulnerable. He was fucking with our heads pretty good, and anyone that hadn't become hooked by his power wouldn't of hung out with this guy for a minute. He was good at tricking people into liking him though, before he revealed his abstract nature.\n\nThe wilderness has IOB's everywhere and once you can perceive them you no longer cannot unless you really work at closing that door, but there are from what I can determine, various levels. Some are straight up massive and purely merge with the night, like you are looking at a scene, and there is something in front of the screen that is just black like the night, but it is blocking the scene behind it. Most have color, and are made of up multi colored shapes all stacked together, like a triangle on top of a rectangle next to circle, but overlapping and all strewn together making up like a bipedal looking being. There are ones that resemble just blobs of energy that are really little, and lunge at you. Some look like strange deformed animals, some like regular people with clothes and hats, and some look monstrous. There is also just the straight up shadow world, which is very seductive, and seems like the most dangerous to me. There are seemingly infinite kinds. \n\nI had one fully attach to me in the mountains of Montana one time. I had just experienced a major breakthrough in dreaming awake and I was walking down the side of the mountain behind my teacher, and he turned to me and said to me in a sharp whisper, why are you following me? I was super thrown off, and was on plant medicine at that time, and not really in a place to be alone, but I had no choice. So I followed a different route down the mountain. \n\nI found myself walking along a stream, and the sound and and silvery colors of the water was so incredible to me. I had had a breakthrough with my fibers that night, so I was feeling the world in a brand new way for the first time. I didn't feel the need to cover my gap for the first time in years. The sound of the water intensified and I sensed a sudden presence, and I realized that there was a very small IOB using the stream, as it's cover so to speak. I could see it in the water, and the sound was suddenly truly loud. I was fascinated with this discovery. It instantly lunged at my gap. It hurt. Not terribly, but it hurt and it didn't feel OK at all. My fear escalated exponentially. I didn't know what to do, and I started to lose my shit. \n\nI managed to make it back to town and to the apartment we were all living in. I was too embarrassed to tell anyone what had happened. I spent the first night, experiencing this thing crawl all over me. It was hanging out on my head mostly. I was so scared. I told my teacher the next day what had happened, and that this thing was driving me mad. I hadn't slept or had any relief and was feeling hopeless. He harangued me for being a weak man that lets thing attach to himself, and that he wouldn't help me whatsoever, and he said I had to intend it away on my own. I had no idea how to do that, and after a few days not being able to sleep or even calm down and trying to not lose my mind as this thing just sort of got worse, I packed up my stuff and left. \n\nI intuited that I needed to get my shields back, so I moved back home, got a job with an old friend, and tried to get used to living with this attachment and sort of pretending it wasn't a problem. After a few weeks, I began to get some relief, and eventually over time, I was able to sort of put a lid on my ability to perceive the inorganic realm and even block the intensity of this attachment. I never got rid of it. It went dormant.\n\nAbout 15 years later, I was getting acupuncture, and my acupuncturist said. Umm, you have a little friend here. I was surprised because I assumed it had left, but she asked if I wanted her to ask it to leave, and that she knows how to remove and return it to where it came from, and I agreed. \n\nNone of what I went through was that big of a deal now that I remember it, and I probably could of done something entirely different, but to me at the time it was terror. Also, none of what I went through is by any means necessary in order to learn about the inorganic realm.

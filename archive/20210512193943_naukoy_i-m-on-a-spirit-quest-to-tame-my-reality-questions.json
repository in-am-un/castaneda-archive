In retrospect, I believe this method of conducting the apprenticeship prevented the training from being successful, because it retarded the advent of the full commitment I needed to become a sorcerer.

That was not what I wanted.

To discover that order and to understand it proved to be a most difficult task for me. \n\nMy inability to arrive at an understanding seems to have been traceable to the fact that, after four years of apprenticeship, I was still a beginner.

This subreddit won't work that way.

Preprogrammed, repeating forever in slightly different variations.\n\nAs a programmer, imagine you're currently in one virtual reality.  You believe you have control over it, when in fact you're very limited in how you can affect it.\n\nDisappointed with it,  maybe you hear about other realities almost like this one, and that it's possible to switch to those.\n\nUsing Tai Chi, Buddhism, Daoism, Hinduism.\n\nIt could be that at one time you could use those, although I truly doubt it.  Magic was removed from this world much longer ago than those systems came about. 10,000 years is a very reasonable estimate of when the process of removing it began.  Agriculture is likely what caused it to be removed.\n\nSo if those systems ever worked, they certainly don't any more.\n\nJust look around!   Research the problem, the way a programmer researches a difficult math algorithm he has to implement.\n\nDo you see any place like this, anywhere?  Where ordinary people are learning real magic, you can talk to them, you can see it with your own eyes in the posts, and no one is making any money.\n\nEven with money being traded, you won't find a place with real magic.  Just a bunch of claims with no evidence the teacher ever taught even a single person.\n\nSure, you can go into the \"real witchcraft\" subreddit,and everyone will insist they are doing real magic.\n\nBut unless you're an idiot, it's obvious they're just needy people who feel better, making claims like that.\n\nThey kicked me out of there, and everywhere else they ought to be interested in the real thing.\n\nThey aren't.\n\nIn here, you get the specifics of how to make magic work.\n\nTechniques which produce a predicted result, and you can see people getting those results at all stages.\n\nMeanwhile, the stuff you mentioned, the asian \"systems\", are all crummy businesses like your corner mini-mall \"Yoga Teacher\".  They're no longer what they claim to be.\n\nThat mini-mall yoga teacher compared to the most powerful Yogi of all time, is what's going on with everything system mentioned.\n\nThey're all entirely the corner yoga teacher, and there's none of the most powerful Yogis of all time left.\n\nSo all these ideas you have in your head to fix it, won't work.  You were brainwashed by the sales literature surrounding you.\n\nUnfortunately it takes so long to figure that out, even going from system to system each time you discover you were tricked,  that you eventually become too tired to even try again.\n\nWhich is why deep in your heart, you  suspect this isn't going to work.  We all know, the crazy guy who suddenly is wearing Yogi diapers on mountain tops, always fails and goes back to church where grandma told him to.\n\nThey don't work, because in fact you can't switch realities.\n\nAll you can do is try to get attention of the controlling nerd, up in the control room, and convince him to switch it a tiny bit for you.\n\nHe can switch a small percent, in the direction you want.\n\nBut you have to get his attention.\n\nNow, the guy is clueless about your situation. He has too many drones to watch over, and none are all that important.  They can't be, or he'd have a nervous breakdown.\n\nTruth is, he'd just as well send you to Jehovah's witness reality, as the good ones.    He's actually collecting data for his evil boss, Mr. Eagle.  Any data is good enough for Mr. Eagle. He sells it to google.  Doesn't much care if it's happy data, or sad data.\n\nSo you have to get his attention in ways which cause him to switch you to the reality you want, one tiny click at a time.  And the bastard has a \"click limit\" for each person.\n\nYou have to be precise, and make a steady effort, to get the maximum number of clicks per month out of the controller.  In the right direction.\n\nHe can't do that, if your mind is all over the place.\n\nYou'll end up with some crummy in between.\n\nMeanwhile, even as you try to get his attention to send you to the place you want to go, he's watching others, and switching them to where they want to go.\n\nHe's an equal opportunity programmer,  maybe even a little \"woke\".\n\nSo if you want to be sent to one of the bad places, like the evil  sorcery of the very unwoke Olmec Indians, you really have to be specific about it.\n\nIt's an odd request.  All of your daily actions were taught to you, to make you avoid that sort of reality.  Even your own behavior will betray you, if you try to go down this road.\n\nHere's another analogy.\n\nA man has a special helicopter that can reach the top of the highest mountain on earth.\n\nNormal helicopters can't possibly go that high, the air is too thin.\n\nHe takes people up there on request. Or better put, if you get his attention, he'll lower a rope, you tie it to your waist, and he flies off with you in tow.\n\nDoesn't matter how much you flap your wings.  You have to be carried by him, and only him.  And he's outside somewhere above you.  \n\nUnfortunately, there's a bunch of greedy cheap helicopter owners who will try to trick you, to hook their rope to your waist. They want your money.\n\nAnd the rope of the helicopter you need, is not very comfortable.\n\nThe fakers have plush fur lined ropes with a harness to sit in, which makes you very comfortable.\n\nTrouble is, if you let one of those guys fly  you, you get dumped in a swamp.\n\nThose are \"swamp flier\" brand helicopters.\n\nI've been fighting those swamp people all last week on facebook, neglecting this place a little,  until Cholita (my witch friend) put her foot down again and told me to stop that.\n\nBut the phony helicopter people had good names, implying they could fly you to that highest mountain top.\n\nCloudfoot, Eaglefeather. They all had good sounding names.\n\nBut all are swamp fliers.\n\nThere's only one correct way to get where this subreddit takes you, even if the rope is uncomfortable.\n\nFor women...\n\nNot much of what I just said applies.\n\nWomen are witches.

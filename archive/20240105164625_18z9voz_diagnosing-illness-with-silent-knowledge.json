To appeal to Yogananda followers, so they can get their money too.\n\nThis made up religion and the new \"enhanced\" Buddha took off and covered most of Asia, taking over prostitution and corrupting local politics by stealing valuable land from old senile Asian men, with the promise they'd go to heaven, and afterwards get a favorable rebirth.\n\nThey even started to blackmail important politicians by luring them with child sex in the temples.\n\nJust look at how much trouble that's causing Bill Clinton lately.

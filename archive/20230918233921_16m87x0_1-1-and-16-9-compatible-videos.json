And remind you, you need to travel to get there, even if it's at billions of light years per second.\n\nWhat you say?\n\nYes, you REALLY get to do that.  Travel to distant worlds, seemingly in your physical body because you pretty much just leap into space while doing darkroom.\n\nHow that's possible I have no idea, but there's no bumps on your head or blood on the floor the next day.\n\nHere's the cropped Instagram version. Notice that all we lost for this intro was \"Zombie Fairy\".\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/CxWP4qkhFQt/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxWP4qkhFQt/)\n\nShe did in fact do things like that, to scare the hell out of me.\n\nWay back before I \"wrestled\" her.  Maybe 10 years ago now?\n\nYes, the books were telling the truth.\n\nYou DO have to wrestle an Ally.\n\nExcept that just means you have to stand up to them as best you can, even when it's hopeless. And never give in.\n\nWhich can take many forms.\n\nIf you find yourself peeing your pants saying, \"You mean those GODAWFUL THINGS ARE REAL?!!!!\"\n\nThen you'll figure it out.  Won't be much choice but to figure it out.\n\nI tried running once, and both Little Smoke and the Devil's Weed entity chased me across an entire floor at a luxury hotel in Shanghai.\n\nOddly, no one noticed.\n\nI was hoping someone would be in the hallway, but they were oddly empty at the time.\n\nJust as happens in the books of Carlos!\n\nSince I ran to my Mandarin interpreter to find out if he could see them too, I do know for a fact I actually ran across that entire hotel floor.\n\nBut still, no one was there.\n\nEven just that is as odd as being chased by billion year old spirits.\n\nThe cropped instagram version is not as good without the Zombie...\n\nI'm converting my cat into a squirrel, because I can't seem to buy one.\n\nCats you can buy, but not squirrels?\n\nAnd the one I made in Blender takes 15 minutes to render a single image. So I'm not able to port it to the software I use to make videos.\n\nToo many squirrel hairs on the body.\n\nThanks to Athena for getting me to figure out how to make all social media sizes work.\n\nI just wish I had a \"switch\" function for my software to shrink the texts for Tik Tok as needed.\n\nI'll have to click on at last 16 buttons to make it follow that format.\n\nHere's a still I'm hoping becomes the post picture.

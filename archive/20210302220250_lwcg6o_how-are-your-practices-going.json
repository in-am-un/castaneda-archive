The goggles I got are pretty good but after a few minutes the tape pealed back a little and let some light in. It's amazing how such a tiny amount of light can seem so bright when it's all you can see. I've fixed them up for next time.\n\nNot much outer phenomena. Could see a movement effect if I waved my hands in front of my face but that was it. Had quite a few hypnagogic-like hallucinations, all strong enough to discern but too weak to enter like a dream, pretty common for a meditation session. They all felt like they were inwards as well, rather than outwards which I get the feeling is where I should be directing my focus.\n\nHad a couple of blips of consciousness. For example at one point my vision rapidly flashed red and blue about four or five times and then there was an instantaneous jump, as though I'd momentarily lost consciousness but it wasn't even long enough for me to nod forward. Another time, I felt my awareness slide down to the left and then experienced a vivid crushing sensation in my mouth, as though I were biting into my own teeth but they were made of biscuits and nougat. Everything suddenly stopped and started again and I was sitting upright.\n\nI had a productive meditation session last weekend where I could clearly see the difference between two different states of consciousness; an expanded outwards kind of state that made me feel vaster with no visual phenomena, and a second state that felt more inwards as though my awareness were moving downward and curling up in front of my stomach, accompanied by a lot of dream images. When I transitioned between the two I shivered/shuddered a couple of times and my breathing noticeably changed, so my assemblage point was moving somewhere.

The goggles I got are pretty good but after a few minutes the tape pealed back a little and let some light in.

Could see a movement effect if I waved my hands in front of my face but that was it. Had quite a few hypnagogic-like hallucinations, all strong enough to discern but too weak to enter like a dream, pretty common for a meditation session. They all felt like they were inwards as well, rather than outwards which I get the feeling is where I should be directing my focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had a couple of blips of consciousness.

The lecture by Carlos.  I believe because we have been bombarded by false spiritualism from Buddhism, Hinduism, and Daoism.\n\nThey have a tiny bit of magic in there, but it's so distorted, they practically use the idea of \"ego\" like a rolled up newspaper, for hitting a bad dog.\n\nOr maybe it's your 2nd grade teacher lecturing you on sharing the cupcakes on treat day, and not always thinking only of yourself.\n\nWhichever, we have a very judgmental idea of that concept, of \"eliminating me\".\n\nLike that means, we're doing to be saints.\n\nSo I suppose I blocked out the idea that it's merely a precise spot between the toes.  But Florinda's lecture notes reminded me again.\n\nIf the fliers lick you down just to the level of your toes (generously stated by Florinda as ankle bone deep), then the \"spot\" shown in that picture is focusing on very few emanations.  A quite limited view of reality.\n\nYou're mostly \"glossing\".  Imagining what's going on, like a person with a huge hangover unable to concentrate on anything but their neediness and sorrow.\n\nOf course, you might be a Pollyanna type, and claim it's not so.  Life is wonderful!\n\nBut just watch them fall apart over time, and finally admit how bad life has become.  Then you find out they were pretending all along, to save face with their friends.\n\nIt's inevitable when you're stuck in a view of reality which creates the imaginary obsession with your needy \"self\", always requiring defending.\n\nThat's of course the madness of the bad players who come here.  I suppose to new people it seems arbitrary, but in fact the problem with bad players is 100% \"me\" obsession.\n\nThere isn't any compromise on it.  No excuses, no rationalization.  No extenuating circumstances.  You can get dragged into their lunacy all you want, but in the end it takes only a sentence or two posted by people who have never been silent,  and want everyone to believe they are powerful sorcerers, to realize it's hopeless and best if they go away quietly.\n\nThe good news is, anyone can raise up their energy using Tensegrity, and by darkroom gazing reducing your internal dialogue.  Once you learn to get rid of your internal dialogue enough to produce visible magic, you stop being such an asshole.\n\nBut even as your energy of awareness raises up, even above your knees,  I suppose your \"me\" still survives.\n\nI'm not sure though.  Possibly if you raise it so much, the \"me\" gets stuck at the bottom by the feet, and even if you focus your awareness like a beam, between your toes, it's intersecting 10 times as many  emanations.  So \"me\" is obscured.\n\nBut if you want best results, get rid of \"Me\".\n\nWhat's that like?\n\nIt's actually simple.\n\nYou move your assemblage point all the way to the orange zone, until you can see whitish light on all surfaces.\n\nThen, you long to play around.\n\nIn my case, last night, I wanted to sustain remote viewing on my bedspread.\n\nBut I couldn't seem to make use of my energy.   I had enough to remote view, but the place I was viewing was a pit of worms, in white muck.\n\nI was looking into a worm swamp, made out of mechanical parts.\n\nOf course, that's not it. But it's as close as I can get.\n\nI tried to find any remaining traces of internal dialogue, to see why I couldn't \"assemble\" a nice looking place in Mexico, to fly over for remote viewing.\n\nI worked on that so hard and so long, I found my self with an orange arm, attached to my body.  I had to remove the orange arm, to return back to remote viewing.\n\nI was stuck in a pit of worm muck, which had turned into my right arm bent in front of me.\n\nIt took an hour to escape.  At which point, I bent my head down to my ankles, sitting up on pillows.  Moving my head down to my ankles always seems to mix some lower energy, with my upper energy, and if I remain silent for a minute a \"happy coincidence\" will happen. I'll get into full on waking dreaming, and enter it.\n\nI found myself walking around in the second attention, looking for the answer to my remote viewing problem.\n\nI realized the problem.  I had been thinking about it all wrong.\n\nInstead of \"forgetting yourself\", in order to stop the motivation that's creating very subtle mistakes in your internal silence, the real answer is as always the same.\n\nIt's not wrong thinking.\n\nIt's just the position of the assemblage point.\n\nFlorinda had explained it in lecture notes someone found, and I recalled the lecture Carlos gave us on this topic.\n\nJust forget \"me\" and let the assemblage point move.\n\nIt worked.\n\nSo if you get your assemblage point shut down, keep in mind \"me\" is responsible for constantly bringing it back.\n\nOr to be more down to earth, notice yourself thinking of an image of you, and some activity.\n\nFantasizing.\n\nBut without words.\n\nYou'll find it!  We all do that.  WE have a little imaginary \"us\" in our daydreaming realm, and we are ready to \"defend\" it, even while trying to do darkroom gazing.\n\nStop it!\n\nYour feeling will be, at first, \"What is that going to do???  Nothing!\"\n\nBut you're wrong.\n\nToss it out.\n\nIt takes around 5 minutes of having tossed it out, and having kept the internal dialogue off also, to find the results.\n\nThe whitish light you see everywhere, will be fully active with manifesting dreams, portals, beings.\n\nIt catches on magical fire!\n\nLast night when I did that, I was still gazing at the bedspread trying to make a stable scene for remote viewing.\n\nI was almost there, when I noticed Lily was on the floor below the bed, trying to get my attention.\n\nShe had taken me to her world again, and wanted me to see her \"friend\".\n\nThey were both stuck in a crack in some dried mud.  Or they lived in there.\n\nI have no idea, but it was Lily's world.\n\nI've seen it 4 times now, just because I asked her.\n\nIt's different from Fancy's world and Fairy's world.\n\nIt shows up by itself, when you aren't thinking about that at all.\n\nBut there it is, looking consistent.\n\nI have noticed something a little suspicious.\n\nIOBs like the red zone.\n\nThey're not too thrilled about the orange zone, and the purple zone spells doom for their fun.\n\nThey start to lose the ability to interact with you, at the orange zone.\n\nSo often when you're starting to move deeper into the orange, they \"make you an offer you can't refuse\".\n\nLike Lily introducing me to her favorite demon friend.\n\nHard to ignore...\n\nAnd it worked. Stopped me from going deeper into the orange.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "My Favorite Technique Lately", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"q67sleq7r3l71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q67sleq7r3l71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf928735cc10046ea52011a07f46e5e4b4c8fb0f"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q67sleq7r3l71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26c524a2453ae67eb2882fc377dc27ad7adf9845"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q67sleq7r3l71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=119bd29f0cfeb8b946e0f3b3b3414ef1b7a1af36"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q67sleq7r3l71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfffc4b3f542061966b967fea32df7e26e32ddfe"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q67sleq7r3l71.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61b3886a022b7fa38cf100747ae3c950b30287f0"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q67sleq7r3l71.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3dae8e24ca61e191f3625291d1bdfc6d4f0858b"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q67sleq7r3l71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c3b68691901e1cfad6dafc7b108db8436884eb6"}, "id": "q67sleq7r3l71"}}, "name": "t3_pg2ppp", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/oNMRd7je-nCuAlFS9PgnNzcq3L5RwoLrNzyIT_hNeRY.jpg", "edited": 1630593895.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1630529184.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q67sleq7r3l71.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5c3b68691901e1cfad6dafc7b108db8436884eb6\"&gt;Remove all fantasies containing \\&amp;quot;ME\\&amp;quot; for a super boost to silence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must admit,  I hated the lecture about &amp;quot;me&amp;quot;.

With my own eyes.  Open too.\n\nBut people who can see inorganic beings as often as they like, no longer put any stock in what they look like.\n\nIf someone goes on about seeing a flier, they have no sorcery knowledge.\n\nI've seen Tinkerbell.  Should I go around pitching her as real?\n\nAnd consider this travesty!\n\nThe Jewish prophets were sorcerers for sure.  Possibly from the same strain of magic as the Olmecs.\n\nAnd their main technique was the same as ours.\n\nThey forced themselves silent, put their head by their ankles (which I do nightly too) even trying to remove more internal dialogue traces and side effects than we do, looking for \"divine light\". They moved their assemblage points that way.\n\nThey had no idea what the assemblage point was, but they did move it.\n\nSaw the same things we do too!  Demons, Angels, Heaven, God.\n\nI've seen all of those multiple times.\n\nBUT, then they pretended that the appearance of demons was consistent.\n\nAnd God was at odds with demons, with Angels being our helpers.\n\nAnd created a head demon, \"Lucifer\".\n\nWhich just meant shining one or glistening one, or something similar.

I had to rush into group chat and take notes.  Usually I'd rewrite the whole thing, but once you have the basics of sorcery those are \"ideas\" that don't need any elaboration.  I'll try to correct the typos.\n\n\r  \n\\*\\*\\* from chat.\r  \n\r  \nI'm starting to think having a dreaming emissary is sometimes not as ideal as you expect. They can be quite persistent. I'll forget all this if I don't put it down right now. Cant even afford to correct spelling.\r  \n\r  \nCarlos really harped on the \"me\" beam between your toes. Turns out, for good reason.\r  \nSilence allows the assemblage point to move, but once you can get silent you have to seek and destroy \"me\". It's the source of most relapses in the internal dialogue.\r  \n\r  \nWhen Zuleica said that taking care of someone else is one of the best things sorcerers can do, she was referring to the anti-me benefits. If you have to think about the welfare of another person constantly, that's time you are not thinking about \"me\".\r  \n\r  \nWhen you are silent and not thinking about ME (easier than quotes), your energy of what to perceive or ponder is freed up. Won't do a monk or some saint like anti-ME person any good at all, because they aren't silent.\r  \n\r  \nBut if you are silent, dropping ME allows you to pick up energy concentrations. Recap does the same thing; you are looking for energy concentrations. And your ME has been altered by the process of recap.\r  \n\r  \nSo you can perceive a tiny flicker of something you would normally have no chance to perceive, and that can realign your awareness on different emanations. I suppose you could even assemblage a different world that way, but there's no need. \r  \n\r  \nThe abstract is so new and unique to us, just allowing a tiny piece of the abstract in is really nice. I can't quite describe it but the abstract is the essence of what we need from magic and the unknown.\r  \n\r  \nSilence + no ME means you can pick up very subtle things, and detect the abstract. And there's something odd about it. It goes into the past.\r  \n\r  \nFor example, you pick up a smoothness, and when you focus on the sensation of smoothness it\u2019s very rich in other feelings. You realize in the past you could find that feeling in a specific object, or object in a situation. \r  \n\r  \nA candy bar for example. You sense the abstract, have no me, no internal dialogue, so that object materializes in the air (in a dark room), and you can analyze the abstract component. When you do it unties a history of that object, and how the abstract was palpable around that object. Even back to childhood.\r  \n\r  \nME is a very important topic.\r  \n\r  \nAs a result of me, at least in part, creating infinity theater is inevitable for a teacher. A teacher can encircle ME in a topic, point out how useless and harmful it is, and an apprentice will pick up some subconscious understanding from the example.\r  \n\r  \nIt's like a child burning his hand on the stove. You don't have to explain that to him. \r  \n\r  \nSame as a ME example in infinity theater. But it\u2019s of no use to an apprentice who never learns to get silent.\r  \n\r  \nIn fact, most of sorcery is wasted on people who cant get silent which is exactly what doomed the Sunday class. Carlos taught us wonders but they're useless to someone with an internal dialogue.\r  \n\r  \nNo ME would be even better, but at least he could work on that one if we had learned silence.\r  \nI don\u2019t understand why Carol Tiggs doesn\u2019t fix that...  She knows.  Perhaps she doesn\u2019t want to tinker with the intent Carlos set up.\r  \n\r  \nCarlos was working on that at the end. He saw we would not use the techniques from the books, so he made props to learn silence, had us do it in class, and generally started to fix that situation.\r  \n\r  \nBut Florinda was still emphasizing recap and tensegrity as late as 97.\r  \nThose are good, but a big waste of time for people who never learn silence.\r  \nTensegrity maybe not, but what good is recap if you are only behaving like an old man in a rocking chair.\r  \n\r  \nWhich I\u2019m afraid may be Reni\u2019s fate.\r  \n\r  \nNyei seems still hungry for new magic, but possibly because she\u2019s lost workshop revenue\r  \n\r  \nME is easier to find and move than we understand. Just catch all fantasies involving an idea of yourself.\r  \nIt seems like a natural idea, but in fact it\u2019s a weird obsession.\r  \n\r  \nDogs for example, have a little me but they don\u2019t spend all of their time being offended over it. Cats on the other hand... I think they have some ME going on there...\r  \n\r  \nSo in darkroom once you get rid of internal dialogue, you will constantly relapse. Those are ME issues. Without me, and no internal dialogue, it\u2019s like being on a tall hill in a car, and releasing all the brakes.  There\u2019s no way you won\u2019t drift downhill.\r  \n\r  \nIn the darkroom, no ME will cause you to follow energy \"leads\". \r  \n\r  \nLily isn\u2019t a big fan of orange magic, she likes red. But not in an aggressive way.\r  \n\r  \nFancy was \"evil\" mostly because she was an aggressive red magic advocate. Red magic can sneak in but until you remove ME, it\u2019s hard to see. ME is a red zone advocate.\r  \nMakes a better book deal.\r  \n\r  \nin fact, book deals are ME, magic, ME, magic, ME... you get the point.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s pretty ugly to want a book deal. Fatal perhaps.\r  \n\r  \nRemoving me fragments perception.\r  \n\r  \nWe have a unified sense of vision because were glossing over most of it. We\u2019re perceiving scenes with our eyes, so we can relate them to ME.\r  \n\r  \nWhich might imply women have a bigger issue with ME, due to how they perceive like a funnel with the wide end out.\r  \n\r  \nIf you get rid of me, your eyesight is composed of elements, not scenes. Each one can move the assemblage point.\r  \n\r  \nFor example, I was having weird things happen while reading today. A single word would vanish from the text. Permanently...  It wasn\u2019t clouded. It was simply gone.\r  \n\r  \nSo I\u2019d be looking at a word and want to refer to the next (technical stuff) but that one is invisible.\r  \n\r  \nI thought maybe old man, cataracts, so I mapped out if there were any holes in my sight, using sunlight glitter. No holes.\r  \n\r  \nSo no ME will possibly change ones sight or its potential to move the assemblage point will be increased.\r  \n\r  \nMight be why don Juan rolls his eyes, to change a mood.\r  \n\r  \nWon\u2019t work perhaps, if you still have ME making your eyesight like a snapshot rather than pieces you could gaze at, and move your assemblage point.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hbbqhmd", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily pushed me with the dreaming emissary thing last night. I had to rush into group chat and take notes.  Usually I&amp;#39;d rewrite the whole thing, but once you have the basics of sorcery those are &amp;quot;ideas&amp;quot; that don&amp;#39;t need any elaboration.  I&amp;#39;ll try to correct the typos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*** from chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to think having a dreaming emissary is sometimes not as ideal as you expect. They can be quite persistent. I&amp;#39;ll forget all this if I don&amp;#39;t put it down right now. Cant even afford to correct spelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos really harped on the &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; beam between your toes. Turns out, for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence allows the assemblage point to move, but once you can get silent you have to seek and destroy &amp;quot;me&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s the source of most relapses in the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Zuleica said that taking care of someone else is one of the best things sorcerers can do, she was referring to the anti-me benefits. If you have to think about the welfare of another person constantly, that&amp;#39;s time you are not thinking about &amp;quot;me&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you are silent and not thinking about ME (easier than quotes), your energy of what to perceive or ponder is freed up. Won&amp;#39;t do a monk or some saint like anti-ME person any good at all, because they aren&amp;#39;t silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you are silent, dropping ME allows you to pick up energy concentrations. Recap does the same thing; you are looking for energy concentrations. And your ME has been altered by the process of recap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can perceive a tiny flicker of something you would normally have no chance to perceive, and that can realign your awareness on different emanations. I suppose you could even assemblage a different world that way, but there&amp;#39;s no need. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The abstract is so new and unique to us, just allowing a tiny piece of the abstract in is really nice. I can&amp;#39;t quite describe it but the abstract is the essence of what we need from magic and the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence + no ME means you can pick up very subtle things, and detect the abstract. And there&amp;#39;s something odd about it. It goes into the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, you pick up a smoothness, and when you focus on the sensation of smoothness it\u2019s very rich in other feelings. You realize in the past you could find that feeling in a specific object, or object in a situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A candy bar for example. You sense the abstract, have no me, no internal dialogue, so that object materializes in the air (in a dark room), and you can analyze the abstract component. When you do it unties a history of that object, and how the abstract was palpable around that object. Even back to childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ME is a very important topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result of me, at least in part, creating infinity theater is inevitable for a teacher.

Remove all traces of that internal dialogue.  While removing it, look for the images that drive it.  Pictures in the mind.  Remove those too.\n\nTwo minutes of perfect internal silence, and these \"puff\" colors can become visible.\n\nBut if not, keep it up.  Silence doesn't do it. It only makes it possible.\n\nThe \"assemblage point\" has to drift.  So you need to find ANYTHING at all.  Things that should not be there.\n\nStare at those in silence.  Soon you'll find the puffs.\n\nPlease forgive my image editing. The purple color is off, and the IOB face should be diffuse around the edges.\n\nAlso, the Yin/Yang whorl should be more intense, with a bright edge around it.  Perhaps light blue.\n\nAnd I should have \"mirrored\" it. It spends clockwise for me, not counter like that pic shows.  The jet black eats up the purple.\n\nIt's the bright edge that can spin off text you can read.  Any sort of overly bright stuff in darkness \"twinkles\", and can imitate the \"shine\" of the eyes.\n\nIt can summon intent. That's how the text forms.\n\nDoes it always fly off at an angle like that?\n\nAlways has for me, but I suspect Carlos could even tap into entire pages of text to read to us.\n\nWhen he was \"reading off the wall\", he was facing southeast, gazing slightly above the horizon.\n\nThat wasn't aligned to the room, so he did that on purpose. It looked like he was gazing just over the top of the heads of the people in class, standing in front of him.\n\nThe purple puff is too close to violet.  Mine are closer to purple.\n\nAnd they tend to waft a bit, leaving a nicer tail as they float around.  They can even \"smear\".\n\nAnd later, you can smear them across the room, leaving an intense visible purple streak in space!\n\nDarned if it doesn't stay there, a lot longer than you'd expect.\n\nFor me, they flow from the upper right, to the lower left.\n\nThe Taiwanese Bosses son comes close to seeing the yin/yang, except he's still stuck with his eyes closed.\n\nGotta open them!\n\nYou want to be a wimp?\n\nNo one cares what you see with your eyes closed!\n\nThe flow from upper right to lower left is the same path Carlos used to \"introduce\" us to his allies, and the same path the Moth took over the campfire, when don Juan pointed out it wasn't a moth, or it's wings would get burned. It flew over the campfire several times.\n\nIf you sit up on pillows in darkness, forcing deeper and deeper silence, you're likely to notice that swoop.\n\nIt's a soundless swoop of  something dead black.  Like a huge moth, flying in your room, with no sound.\n\nYou only feel the \"wake\" like a black ripple in space.\n\nIf you look for that, you might find it.\n\nSo watch out!  Normally we ignore them in every way.\n\nOften it's accompanied by a gentle tap on the left shoulder blade, knocking you forward a bit.\n\nIt happens on the way to stopping the world.\n\nI guess an inorganic being (IOB) decides to give you a boost, and push on your assemblage point for you.\n\nI've never seen that help stop the world, but you can feel a tingle.\n\nSo it's clear the IOB moved the assemblage point.\n\nProbably the selfish bastard moved it to make you more able to perceive her.\n\nBut so what?   It's too cool!\n\nYes, it's a her.\n\nThey're nearly all female, as is most life in the universe.\n\nMost on earth too, but you need to study biology to realize that.  Most creatures have no males.\n\nIt's mostly the bigger ones that are obsessed with DNA swapping.\n\nI guess there's not much use for males, except to keep then as sex prisoners.\n\nAnd that's their goal.  Minus the sex, unless you want that sort of thing.\n\nBut they like women too.\n\nJust ask Cholita.\n\nShe's wondering what that leprechaun is, in her latest writings.  She draws elaborate pictures for me, with writing to explain the diagrams.\n\nThere's one from when she returned from scouting a day or two ago.\n\nI'd post it, but she'd cut my balls off and fry them.\n\nOr so she promised.\n\nIt's not a leprechaun, but that's a good idea. I never thought of that.\n\nIt's Minx, of course!\n\nShe brought her back from her last scouting trip.\n\nIf you want to find an IOB of your own, look for any features on a puff of color which remind you of a face.\n\nThey can be as poor as the one illustrated.\n\nMost puffs won't have any such details, tending to be smooth in the middle.\n\nBut if you want to find one, and you have puff after puff floating past you, you'll eventually find one.\n\nYou'll feel stupid for thinking, \"That could be a face!\".\n\nBut then 10 seconds later another will go by, with a face as horrifying as the one shown above.\n\nIntent often has a small delay. Just enough time to confuse you about cause and effect.\n\nYou'll get goosebumps the first time, as your assemblage point jumps a little too fast.\n\nIOBs like to scare.\n\nIf you see that face, tell it in words, \"Don't be like that!   Be pretty!\"\n\nIt will likely oblige on the next puff. Even smile!\n\nIf you can get the puff to stop flowing, it'll start to animate, right in place.\n\nIt only changes appearance when you see the last one. With our reaction rate around 1/2 second to \"recognize\" something, it'll animate slowly.\n\nLike an old-fashioned web cam.\n\nHowever, watching that will pull your assemblage point, and if you are pulled into sleep it can animate as fast as any dream.  But you'll be submersed into the dream at that point, not just watching the darkness.\n\nYou \"scoop\" puffs of that purple, using moves similar to \"Unbending Intent, Long Form\".\n\nPeople gaze up and around the room looking for something, then leap up and pull it down with their hand.    Here's a link:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273\\_PU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU)\n\nIf you're a nerd, it seems that YouTube moves to the previous key frame. So the timestamps aren't that accurate.  Wait a few seconds, to see the scooping motion.\n\nAnd there's no need to crush it like that.  Elsewhere they're nicer about it.\n\nCrushing them is used to manifest objects.  Hopefully I'll record that technique for you soon.\n\nPlace the scooped puff on your kidney or liver.\n\nIf you can't still see it there, you need more silence.\n\nOver time (many weeks), you can build up your energy body to make it visible, by storing up the \"redeployed energy\".\n\nIt'll migrate to visible as a purple glow, to yellow, to fibers, to darn tentacles waving around the room.\n\nYea. It really does that!  But be patient.\n\nYou have to put as much time into this, as you would a perfect golf swing.\n\nOr juggling.\n\nOr playing the mandolin.\n\nIt's not \"free\"!  You have to earn it. You're wonderfulness is useless here.\n\nNow, this isn't very nice of me to be so specific.  To show you and tell you all this.\n\nCarlos would NOT approve.   Carol might hate it also.\n\nI'm sure Reni does.  Miles, I have no idea.\n\nI was part of faction #3, the \"unclean\" peasants.  Just lucky to be there.\n\nBut we're at war here!  Carlos is fading fast on google results!\n\nKeep in mind.  The reason it's bad for me to show you is, you might see something entirely different.\n\nYou don't need to doubt what you see.\n\nANYTHING you see that should not be  there, is what you're after!\n\nThere's no such thing as, \"That isn't right.  Ignore that.\"\n\nThat's how they castrated people practicing Buddhism!\n\nThat isn't right!   Ignore that.\n\nAnd worse, phonies will copy my descriptions, making it very difficult to tell who's lying.\n\nIf you think they won't lie, look around for the list of \"me-too\" Naguals who plagued Carlos.\n\nSee what their claims are.\n\nYes, they will lie!\n\nThere's money at stake.\n\nBook after book of lies. That's what they'll do.\n\nThey even get assistants to crank out more phony books.\n\nYou hearing me out there?   What are you doing!!??\n\nHow are you \"friends\" with cleargreen?\n\nGet a real job.  Come learn some sorcery.\n\nI suppose they believe the whole thing is made up, so why shouldn't they?\n\nYou can scoop that scary head into your hand, if you turn your head while you do it. Just put your hand, \"under\" It, and turn your head, so it's now near your stomach, sitting in your hand.\n\nBlow into it, to make it brighter (disappointing, but it works with an echo delay).\n\nWave your hand over the room, trying to gather more purple light, and smear it on the head.\n\nKeep that up, and it will form a body.\n\nKeep that up, and it will stand up!\n\nSet it down on the bed, and you'll die from the goosebumps that come, from watching it come to life.\n\nAbandon hope all ye who enter...\n\nIt's more fun that way!\n\nCreepy moves the assemblage point.\n\nThe picture of \"what the IOBs really look like\", is Fairy.\n\nI found her. She was a corpse at first, but I talked her out of that.\n\nNow, she's BEAUTIFUL!\n\nMost of the time.  Sometimes she warns me, by producing a scary face when I need to be alert.\n\nMinx looks like 4 or 5 pretty blue small clouds. A few leftovers in an otherwise clear sky.\n\nCarlos' scariest entity looks like a bar of golden light, around 3 inches wide, and covered in fibers.\n\nOr, it can burn like a catholic candle at a distance, while projecting it's \"face\" closer to you, on \"The Wall\".\n\nIt's very difficult to see \"precisely\" what it looks like, because it keeps projecting what you expect it to look like.\n\nIf you stare down dreaming phantoms, it can appear in the chest of the entity, as if you pulled apart Super Man's shirt, and found his \"S\".\n\nWeird?\n\nFor sure.\n\nEdited four times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sample Colors in Darkness", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"2nujnrsresw41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 58, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2nujnrsresw41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39c2ca32454b604e7920edd518798cf7e31461b7"}, {"y": 116, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2nujnrsresw41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19dfb88a37dbfe989842f92479836a917fd199d1"}, {"y": 172, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2nujnrsresw41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62ed06b2a498fa4cea32d795f20147dc388d3480"}, {"y": 345, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2nujnrsresw41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6388b2d847065255ff70f2cbfab96fada0a0323f"}], "s": {"y": 424, "x": 785, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2nujnrsresw41.jpg?width=785&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a82fde1248d99c8275719693092df971d4f1bb31"}, "id": "2nujnrsresw41"}}, "name": "t3_gd0vvn", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 17, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 459, "scrolling": false, "height": 344}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "3 Times Unbending Intent Long Form", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 344, "width": 459, "version": "1.0", "author_name": "sheeehan111", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pt7n2273_PU/hqdefault.jpg", "type": "video", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/sheeehan111"}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 459, "scrolling": false, "media_domain_url": "https://www.redditmedia.com/mediaembed/gd0vvn", "height": 344}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/INtYMK8sGjFWdFwtFj2QrKx-aXMflAj-55utsQdmY1k.jpg", "edited": 1588980516.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1588549732.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2nujnrsresw41.jpg?width=785&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a82fde1248d99c8275719693092df971d4f1bb31\"&gt;It can get pretty freaky, practicing real sorcery.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you gaze at darkness, these are some things you might see which have been verified by multiple people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Newbies: Absolute darkness.

To show you and tell you all this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos would NOT approve.   Carol might hate it also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure Reni does.  Miles, I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was part of faction #3, the &amp;quot;unclean&amp;quot; peasants.  Just lucky to be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#39;re at war here!  Carlos is fading fast on google results!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind.  The reason it&amp;#39;s bad for me to show you is, you might see something entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need to doubt what you see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ANYTHING you see that should not be  there, is what you&amp;#39;re after!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no such thing as, &amp;quot;That isn&amp;#39;t right.  Ignore that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how they castrated people practicing Buddhism!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;#39;t right!   Ignore that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And worse, phonies will copy my descriptions, making it very difficult to tell who&amp;#39;s lying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think they won&amp;#39;t lie, look around for the list of &amp;quot;me-too&amp;quot; Naguals who plagued Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See what their claims are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, they will lie!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s money at stake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Book after book of lies. That&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ll do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They even get assistants to crank out more phony books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You hearing me out there?   What are you doing!!??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How are you &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; with cleargreen?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get a real job.  Come learn some sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose they believe the whole thing is made up, so why shouldn&amp;#39;t they?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can scoop that scary head into your hand, if you turn your head while you do it. Just put your hand, &amp;quot;under&amp;quot; It, and turn your head, so it&amp;#39;s now near your stomach, sitting in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blow into it, to make it brighter (disappointing, but it works with an echo delay).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wave your hand over the room, trying to gather more purple light, and smear it on the head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep that up, and it will form a body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep that up, and it will stand up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Set it down on the bed, and you&amp;#39;ll die from the goosebumps that come, from watching it come to life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Abandon hope all ye who enter...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s more fun that way!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Creepy moves the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The picture of &amp;quot;what the IOBs really look like&amp;quot;, is Fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found her. She was a corpse at first, but I talked her out of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, she&amp;#39;s BEAUTIFUL!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the time.  Sometimes she warns me, by producing a scary face when I need to be alert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx looks like 4 or 5 pretty blue small clouds. A few leftovers in an otherwise clear sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos&amp;#39; scariest entity looks like a bar of golden light, around 3 inches wide, and covered in fibers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, it can burn like a catholic candle at a distance, while projecting it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;face&amp;quot; closer to you, on &amp;quot;The Wall&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very difficult to see &amp;quot;precisely&amp;quot; what it looks like, because it keeps projecting what you expect it to look like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you stare down dreaming phantoms, it can appear in the chest of the entity, as if you pulled apart Super Man&amp;#39;s shirt, and found his &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weird?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited four times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f79edeb57c35c261b9f0892086809d0ee7d2856b", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2562f4e90cb8b9b1343bfb633d0d54e36b73a5cb", "width": 108, "height": 81}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69d46aa151f94619fef8df683f98d420184d0684", "width": 216, "height": 162}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/kfMH414wtECgrzWCaiyklairiGllGd2rPxIvImeqyns.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bb58bd13fee1b5277d80dc70a957edf8269aeb4", "width": 320, "height": 240}], "variants": {}, "id": "_3SLIMHWFLwTypvnuOaJUYPqANWj5dR5MQLkUtw_PDI"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d442824c-6005-11ea-b1ec-0ebd57ae4429", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "num_reports": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "gd0vvn", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 37, "send_replies": true, "media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "3 Times Unbending Intent Long Form", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"459\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt7n2273_PU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

He gathered all this and that was a very good thing, since I\u2019m not allowed to for the most part.\n\n&gt; Of course, the main reason was my fear of them. \n\nBut that\u2019s super easy to get over!  \n\nI had Minx, the inorganic Cholita picked up, making the most frightening gigantic faces at me a week ago. \n\nI'll use GIMP to make a picture, so you know how REAL this can get.\n\nYou would have run for your life!    Harry Potter would have run!\n\nMinx was threatening to bite my head off. \n\nHe began to swoop in, with his huge mouth and teeth just a foot away from my head.\n\nMy reaction, after playing with inorganics daily for much longer than I want to admit in here,  was this:\n\n\"Oh, this is a cool one!  How does it work?  It's super intense blue, but not ultra-violent like Carlos' allies.  And the size is 200% of normal!\"\n\nFor me, it was a machine.  \n\nI see ants the same way.   Machines. I don't move my foot out of the way if they're too close. I want to see what they'll do.\n\nIf you don't panic, nothing.\n\nSame as bees.  If there's a bee in your car, you don't want to start screaming, \"BEE!!! BEE!!!\"\n\nYou'll get stung.\n\nI was just curious about the technology involved in Minx.\n\nIt took the wind right out of him.  He started mutating into other faces he thought might get a reaction, but none did. I believe he even tried a Chinese nun face.\n\nStill not scary enough!\n\nHe could see that I had absolutely no reaction, other than curiosity.\n\nSince then, he makes me fantastic machines!  \n\nI only just now realized it.   I thought, maybe he'd picked up sculpting from Cholita.\n\nBut no.

If you ask me - I don't have a clear opinion.

As a matter of fact, they were the supreme masters of that art. When I say\r\nthat they knew how to fixate the awareness of their victims, I mean that their secret knowledge\r\nand secret practices allowed them to pry open the mystery of being aware. Enough of their\r\npractices have survived to this day, but fortunately in a modified form. I say fortunately because\r\nthose activities, as I will explain, did not lead the ancient Toltec seers to freedom, but to their\r\ndoom.\"\r\n\n\"He said that ancient seers were damaged by their aberrant insistence on staying glued to their\r\nprocedures, but that whatever they found was valid.\"\n\r\n\"Those old seers were terrifying men,\" don Juan continued. \"I shouldn't use the past tense -\r\nthey are terrifying even today. Their bid is to dominate, to master everybody and everything.\"\r\n\"Even today, don Juan?\" I asked, trying to get him to explain further.\"\n\r\n\"Wherever the assemblage point moves in dreams is called the dreaming position,\"' he went\r\non. \"The old seers became so expert at keeping their dreaming position that they were even able\r\nto wake up while their assemblage points were anchored there.\r\n\"The old seers called that state the dreaming body, because they controlled it to the extreme of\r\ncreating a temporary new body every time they woke up at a new dreaming position.\r\n\"I have to make it clear to you that dreaming has a terrible drawback,\" he went on. \"It belongs\r\nto the old seers. It's tainted with their mood. I've been very careful in guiding you through it, but\r\nstill there is no way to make sure.\"\r\n\"What are you warning me about, don Juan?\" I asked.\r\n\"I'm warning you about the pitfalls of dreaming, which are truly stupendous,\" he replied. \"In\r\ndreaming, there is really no way of directing the movement of the assemblage point; the only\r\nthing that dictates that shift is the inner strength or weakness of dreamers. Right there we have the\r\nfirst pitfall.\"\r\nHe said that at first the new seers were hesitant to use dreaming. It was their belief that\r\ndreaming, instead of fortifying, made warriors weak, compulsive, capricious. The old seers were\r\nall like that. In order to offset the nefarious effect of dreaming, since they had no other option but\r\nto use it, the new seers developed a complex and rich system of behavior called the warriors' way,\r\nor the warriors' path.\r\nWith that system, the new seers fortified themselves and acquired the internal strength they\r\nneeded to guide the shift of the assemblage point in dreams. Don Juan stressed that the strength\r\nthat he was talking about was not conviction alone. No one could have had stronger convictions\r\nthan the old seers, and yet they were weak to the core. Internal strength meant a sense of\r\nequanimity, almost of indifference, a feeling of being at ease, but, above all, it meant a natural\r\nand profound bent for examination, for understanding. The new seers called all these traits of\r\ncharacter sobriety.\r\ncharacter sobriety.\r\n\"The conviction that the new seers have,\" he continued, \"is that a life of impeccability by itself\r\nleads unavoidably to a sense of sobriety, and this in turn leads to the movement of the assemblage\npoint.\r\n\"I've said that the new seers believed that the assemblage point can be moved from within.\r\nThey went one step further and maintained that impeccable men need no one to guide them, that\r\nby themselves, through saving their energy, they can do everything that seers do. All they need is\r\na minimal chance, just to be cognizant of the possibilities that seers have unraveled.\"\n\n\"As Genaro told you, the old seers were dreadful men,\" he said, rubbing his eyes. \"There was\r\nsomething they tried to avoid at all costs: they didn't want to die. You may say that the average\r\nman doesn't want to die either, but the advantage that the old seers had over the average man was\r\nthat they had the concentration and the discipline to intend things away; and they actually\r\nintended death away.\"\r\n\n\"He explained that the old seers discovered that it is possible to move the assemblage point to\r\nthe limit of the known and keep it fixed there in a state of prime heightened awareness. From that\r\nposition, they saw the feasibility of slowly shifting their assemblage points permanently to other\r\npositions beyond that limit - a stupendous feat fraught with daring but lacking sobriety, for they\r\ncould never retract the movement of their assemblage points, or perhaps they never wanted to.\r\nDon Juan said that adventurous men, faced with the choice of dying in the world of ordinary\r\naffairs or dying in unknown worlds, will unavoidably choose the latter, and that the new seers,\r\nrealizing that their predecessors had chosen merely to change the locale of their death, came to\r\nunderstand the futility of it all; the futility of struggling to control their fellow men, the futility of\r\nassembling other worlds, and, above all, the futility of self-importance.\r\nOne of the most fortunate decisions that the new seers made, he said, was never to allow their\r\nassemblage points to move permanently to any position other than heightened awareness. From\r\nthat position, they actually resolved their dilemma of futility and found out that the solution is not\r\nsimply to choose an alternate world in which to die, but to choose total consciousness, total\r\nfreedom.\r\nDon Juan commented that by choosing total freedom, the new seers unwittingly continued in\r\nthe tradition of their predecessors and became the quintessence of the death defiers.\r\nHe explained that the new seers discovered that if the assemblage point is made to shift\r\nconstantly to the confines of the unknown, but is made to return to a position at the limit of the\r\nknown, then when it is suddenly released it moves like lightning across the entire cocoon of man,\r\naligning all the emanations inside the cocoon at once.\r\n\n\"My answer delighted him. He laughed and commented on his own fears of and aversions to\r\nthe inorganic beings.\r\n\"They have never been my cup of tea,\" he said. \"Of course, the main reason was my fear of\r\nthem. I was unable to get over it when I had to, and then it became fixed.\"\r\n\"Do you fear them now, don Juan?\"\r\n\"It's not quite fear I feel but revulsion. I don't want any part of them.\"\r\n\"Is there any particular reason for this revulsion?\"\r\n\"The best reason in the world: we are antithetical. They love slavery, and I love freedom. They\r\nlove to buy, and I don't sell.\"\n\n\"in my previous works.\r\nDuring one of our conversations, don Juan stated that, in order to appreciate the position of\r\ndreamers and dreaming, one has to understand the struggle of modern-day sorcerers to steer\r\nsorcery away from concreteness toward the abstract. \r\n\"What do you call concreteness, don Juan?\" I asked. \r\n\"The practical part of sorcery,\" he said. \"The obsessive fixation of the mind on practices and\r\ntechniques, the unwarranted influence over people. All of these were in the realm of the sorcerers\r\nof the past.\"\r\n\"And what do you call the abstract?\"\r\n\"The search for freedom, freedom to perceive, without obsessions, all that's humanly possible.\r\nI say that present-day sorcerers seek the abstract because they seek freedom; they have no interest\r\nin concrete gains. There are no social functions for them, as there were for the sorcerers of the\r\npast. So you'll never catch them being the official seers or the sorcerers in residence.\"\r\n\"Do you mean, don Juan, that the past has no value to modern-day sorcerers?\"\r\n\"It certainly has value. It's the taste of that past which we don't like. I personally detest the\r\ndarkness and morbidity of the mind. I like the immensity of thought. However, regardless of my\r\nlikes and dislikes, I have to give due credit to the sorcerers of antiquity, for they were the first to\r\nfind out and do everything we know and do today. Don Juan explained that their most important\r\nattainment was to perceive the energetic essence of things. This insight was of such importance\r\nthat it was turned into the basic premise of sorcery. Nowadays, after lifelong discipline and\r\ntraining, sorcerers do acquire the capacity to perceive the essence of things, a capacity they call\r\nseeing.\"", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fplb3sp", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you and JD go and kick some Eastern Bloc butt, once you can stop the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks Dan :-) Time will show.

In order to offset the nefarious effect of dreaming, since they had no other option but\nto use it, the new seers developed a complex and rich system of behavior called the warriors&amp;#39; way,\nor the warriors&amp;#39; path.\nWith that system, the new seers fortified themselves and acquired the internal strength they\nneeded to guide the shift of the assemblage point in dreams. Don Juan stressed that the strength\nthat he was talking about was not conviction alone. No one could have had stronger convictions\nthan the old seers, and yet they were weak to the core. Internal strength meant a sense of\nequanimity, almost of indifference, a feeling of being at ease, but, above all, it meant a natural\nand profound bent for examination, for understanding. The new seers called all these traits of\ncharacter sobriety.\ncharacter sobriety.\n&amp;quot;The conviction that the new seers have,&amp;quot; he continued, &amp;quot;is that a life of impeccability by itself\nleads unavoidably to a sense of sobriety, and this in turn leads to the movement of the assemblage\npoint.\n&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve said that the new seers believed that the assemblage point can be moved from within.\nThey went one step further and maintained that impeccable men need no one to guide them, that\nby themselves, through saving their energy, they can do everything that seers do. All they need is\na minimal chance, just to be cognizant of the possibilities that seers have unraveled.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As Genaro told you, the old seers were dreadful men,&amp;quot; he said, rubbing his eyes. &amp;quot;There was\nsomething they tried to avoid at all costs: they didn&amp;#39;t want to die. You may say that the average\nman doesn&amp;#39;t want to die either, but the advantage that the old seers had over the average man was\nthat they had the concentration and the discipline to intend things away; and they actually\nintended death away.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He explained that the old seers discovered that it is possible to move the assemblage point to\nthe limit of the known and keep it fixed there in a state of prime heightened awareness. From that\nposition, they saw the feasibility of slowly shifting their assemblage points permanently to other\npositions beyond that limit - a stupendous feat fraught with daring but lacking sobriety, for they\ncould never retract the movement of their assemblage points, or perhaps they never wanted to.\nDon Juan said that adventurous men, faced with the choice of dying in the world of ordinary\naffairs or dying in unknown worlds, will unavoidably choose the latter, and that the new seers,\nrealizing that their predecessors had chosen merely to change the locale of their death, came to\nunderstand the futility of it all; the futility of struggling to control their fellow men, the futility of\nassembling other worlds, and, above all, the futility of self-importance.\nOne of the most fortunate decisions that the new seers made, he said, was never to allow their\nassemblage points to move permanently to any position other than heightened awareness. From\nthat position, they actually resolved their dilemma of futility and found out that the solution is not\nsimply to choose an alternate world in which to die, but to choose total consciousness, total\nfreedom.\nDon Juan commented that by choosing total freedom, the new seers unwittingly continued in\nthe tradition of their predecessors and became the quintessence of the death defiers.\nHe explained that the new seers discovered that if the assemblage point is made to shift\nconstantly to the confines of the unknown, but is made to return to a position at the limit of the\nknown, then when it is suddenly released it moves like lightning across the entire cocoon of man,\naligning all the emanations inside the cocoon at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My answer delighted him. He laughed and commented on his own fears of and aversions to\nthe inorganic beings.\n&amp;quot;They have never been my cup of tea,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Of course, the main reason was my fear of\nthem. I was unable to get over it when I had to, and then it became fixed.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Do you fear them now, don Juan?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not quite fear I feel but revulsion. I don&amp;#39;t want any part of them.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Is there any particular reason for this revulsion?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;The best reason in the world: we are antithetical. They love slavery, and I love freedom. They\nlove to buy, and I don&amp;#39;t sell.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;in my previous works.\nDuring one of our conversations, don Juan stated that, in order to appreciate the position of\ndreamers and dreaming, one has to understand the struggle of modern-day sorcerers to steer\nsorcery away from concreteness toward the abstract. \n&amp;quot;What do you call concreteness, don Juan?&amp;quot; I asked. \n&amp;quot;The practical part of sorcery,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;The obsessive fixation of the mind on practices and\ntechniques, the unwarranted influence over people. All of these were in the realm of the sorcerers\nof the past.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;And what do you call the abstract?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;The search for freedom, freedom to perceive, without obsessions, all that&amp;#39;s humanly possible.\nI say that present-day sorcerers seek the abstract because they seek freedom; they have no interest\nin concrete gains. There are no social functions for them, as there were for the sorcerers of the\npast. So you&amp;#39;ll never catch them being the official seers or the sorcerers in residence.&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;Do you mean, don Juan, that the past has no value to modern-day sorcerers?&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;It certainly has value. It&amp;#39;s the taste of that past which we don&amp;#39;t like. I personally detest the\ndarkness and morbidity of the mind. I like the immensity of thought. However, regardless of my\nlikes and dislikes, I have to give due credit to the sorcerers of antiquity, for they were the first to\nfind out and do everything we know and do today. Don Juan explained that their most important\nattainment was to perceive the energetic essence of things. This insight was of such importance\nthat it was turned into the basic premise of sorcery. Nowadays, after lifelong discipline and\ntraining, sorcerers do acquire the capacity to perceive the essence of things, a capacity they call\nseeing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gd0vvn", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gd0vvn/sample_colors_in_darkness/fplb3sp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1588709546.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1588709546.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fplcikt", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "calixto_mooneeeee", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fpl059c", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5kwod04j", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt; It shouldn't be possible for a \"nagual Krelman\" to even exist, if people weren't so impotent and confused.\n\nYes you're right!

From a recent Public Chat Group submission:\n\n*TechnoMagical\\_Intent -* In my notes from a book by Steve Richards, he discusses the cloud at length. Here's just part of one of the chapters. The cloud being what he generally terms \"first matter:\"\n\n\"It is what H. Spencer Lewis described as a faint discolouration of the atmosphere (others have determined it to be something else). If you are using a white background, the cloud will appear to be a very, very faint blue stain that almost cannot be seen at all. The one thing that will tell you for certain when you are getting results is that anything on the other side of the cloud will be blotted out.\n\nThe first time I got results with this experiment, I was lying in bed recovering from influenza, and using the ceiling of my bedroom for a backdrop. I was wondering silently how much longer I should have to work to get success with this phenomenon, when I suddenly noticed that a very slight indentation in the ceiling where I was staring could no longer be seen. This indentation was quite visible before \u2014 you tend to notice such things after staring at them for some time \u2014 and when I looked more closely, I noticed that there was a very subtle blue haze between the ceiling and my eyes. If I looked away from the target area, I could see the ceiling quite dearly. If I looked where this blue haze was forming, I could see nothing. However, if I had looked for the cloud itself, I would never have noticed it. It was almost invisible.\n\nWhen you think you are getting results, it is time for step five \u2014building the cloud. There are several different ways in which this may be accomplished. You will recall that the Buddhist nun mentioned by Madame Blavatsky in chapter two \u2018began to draw together, by large handfuls as it were, invisible material from the surrounding atmosphere\u2019. Some people do have excellent results using their hands in this experiment, and there is a technique that is widely used in Western secret orders based on this principle.\n\nThe idea is to start your hands separated by a foot and a half or so, then bring them together, at the same time holding in mind the thought that you are compressing the astral (second attention) material in the space between them. You are not to gather anything, precisely. The motion that you will make is rather like that of a man playing an accordion. You bring your hands together, then drawn them apart, then bring them together again.\n\nThis technique was once used by members of the Inner Peace Movement, and a woman connected with that movement told me that she could see balls of light forming in the space between her hands when she did this experiment. Some people get excellent results using this method. As for myself, I get nothing whatever.\n\nA method which works better for me is based on will power and eye movement, and does not involve the hands in any way at all. After you have seen the cloud begin to form, look away from it, allow the energy to collect in another region of space, and after a moment or two, bring your eyes gradually toward the centre, where the main cloud is forming, at the same time willing that the energy in other parts of the room will move in and join with the energy already in the cloud. You may glance up above the cloud, then bring your eyes down, willing that the energy above the cloud be added to the energy of the cloud itself, then do the same thing by glancing below the cloud, then to either side of it. Remember as you do this that your willing is not to involve eye-strain in any way. The willing must be entirely mental. The eyes must remain passive if you are to see what you are doing.\"\n\nYou may find it helpful to mix this technique with step number two, and start the building-up process at the same time you start the concentration that allows the cloud to collect in the first place. In other words, rather than concentrate until you can see something visible beginning to collect you might want to alternate between steps one and five, concentrating for a few moments, then building up the cloud for a few moments, and then returning to your concentration. This helps relieve the tedium that often accompanies occult experiments, and can produce some excellent results.\n\n(Step Two)\n\nWith that taken care of, the next step is to sit quietly and comfortably, and direct your eyes to some single place in the room. This is necessary so that the cloud may collect at the place where you are stating. If you glance here for a moment, and there for a moment, the cloud will not build up. The effect of directed attention is cumulative. The longer you look in the same direction, the more definite the cloud you are building becomes.\"\n\nStep Six\n\nAfter you have produced the cloud successfully, you will discover that it has a natural tendency to disperse to the four corners of your room. This is according to the laws of thermodynamics, and if you allow it to happen, eventually the energy in the cloud will become evenly distributed throughout the surrounding space. This dispersing action takes the\\~ form of a spin, and must be countered by another spin of opposite type if the cloud is to be of any use to you.\n\nThe dispersing spin takes place in a clockwise direction, and you must counter it by willing that the cloud spin in an anti-clockwise direction. Once it starts to do this, rather than becoming larger and thinner, it will become smaller and more dense. Therefore, you may need to alternate this step with, step five, causing a anti-clockwise spin, then building up more energy into the cloud as it shrinks.\n\nIf you persist with this, you may build a cloud that is very dense indeed. This is one of the secrets of materialization, and I have been told of an AMORC Grand Master who has completely blotted out the light of a 150 watt bulb in private demonstrations using this method. The Frenchman A. Secour has compared this process with the formation of nebulae in outer space. Astronomers contend that galaxies, including our own, are formed in this way, with gigantic clouds spinning and condensing until they gradually form suns and planets.\u2019\n\nStep Seven\n\nOnce you have formed a cloud that is quite definite and which contains a great deal of astral (second attention) substance, the final step is to draw it around yourself and blot yourself out of view. Once again, the technique is just the logical result of everything we have said thus far. You must produce a cloud large enough to enshroud the human body, then will that it come toward you and surround you. If there is a tendency for it to shine, you may want to will that it assume a neutral colour, perhaps the same colour as your surroundings. I have never noticed this effect myself, but it has been mentioned by numerous others, especially ancient authors. In The Six Keys, Euxodus says of it that \u2018it is properly called the great Lunaria, because of the brightness with which it shines\u2019. If you get this result, you will want to suppress it with your will power. It is no use trying to become invisible in a lighthouse.\n\nThe book from Richards is titled \"Invisibility: Mastering the Art of Vanishing,\" first published in 1982.\n\n*TechnoMagical\\_Intent -* The Eagle's Gift, in which Zuleica's darkroom activity with Carlos is detailed, was published in 1981.

They&amp;#39;ll just start doing that, before even crossing the green.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan on the other hand, believes in sharing freely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in fact, it was holding stuff back, which caused Cleargreen to fail to teach real magic all these years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/p0xzpf/transcranial_magnetic_stimulation/h8b2zr6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1628529446.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_p0xzpf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hd1yitb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "sad_cosmic_joke", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1631778515.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_p0xzpf", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_ecssx", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I'm planning on adding both rTMS and tDCS to my lucid dreaming rig sometime over the next year...\n\nBack story: I've been using EEG recording and feedback for quite some time and I wrote a software suite that generates different (recognizable) ambient soundscapes based on the level of sleep.

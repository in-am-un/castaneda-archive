Not good.\n\nIt's like being trapped in the red zone!\n\nIt turns out, the J curve process can be described as a series of \"tasks\". But understand, once you do something like that, you have created a phantom reality.\n\nWhich is all Olmec sorcery really is.  A phantom reality the Olmecs came up with. That doesn't mean it's pretend.  All of reality has been created by the intent of beings using those emanations. One way of looking at the emanations is no more valid than another.\n\nThe question is, does that view trap you in a hellish existence?\n\nOn the top of the J curve is the blue zone.  A very hellish place. Don Juan called it \"the river of filth\".\n\nYep.  It's so obvious.  I hadn't put it together yet, but advanced dark roomers will realize it. We lose people to the attempt to escape that river (the blue zone).  Some try to find things other than the glowing colorful puffs, because they're anxious to find something to get attention.\n\nI can't flaw that, they're just being observant.  But the motivation is 100% river of filth.\n\nOthers are dreaming of their book deal, or their loyal students sitting at their feet, giving them donations.\n\nThe women might tend to think of some idyllic social structure, where they can find a specialty for themselves and have less turmoil in their lives.\n\nBut we need to emphasize escaping all that noisy internal dialogue (the river of filth narrative). So maybe portray the puffs of color as life preservers tossed into the river of filth, and you have to find one of those, and cling (gaze at) to it.\n\nYou have escaped the river of filth when you can scoop a puff and place it anywhere on your torso.\n\nNext would be to rebuild your energy body. That's a red zone activity because the puffs are most vivid in there.\n\nPuffs exist in the orange zone, but they're crystalline dreaming fog left overs. So you'd be scooping mini-dreams and tiny women's faces (IOBs) onto your torso.  Which is fine, but not good for a beginner to think about.\n\nBy the way, when don Juan kept the IOBs in his gourd on his belt,  it turns out you don't have to be in the Tonal to do that.  Your energy body can also \"attach\" them.\n\nI suppose you escape the green zone and arrive in red proper, when you can see your energy body as a vague glow.    Of course when you can see that, you'll be fairly deep in the red zone, and the puffs will be spectacular.\n\nIt's probably a good idea to scoop puffs by quadrants.\n\nUpper/lower and Left/right.\n\nThe 3 pouches correspond to those quadrants, if you keep in mind the top pouch is actually both adrenals, on either side.  So it's more like 2 pouches stuck together.\n\nThus if you see a puff up high on the left, put that on your left breast.  Far right and below the belly button, put that on the pouch on the right, the one over the liver.\n\nYou escape the red zone, by clearing out all puffs.  So that there's nothing left to scoop.\n\nAt that point you will be in a phantom room, however it's best to see this as the inside of your shell.  The one you redeployed energy from, towards the center of your body.  To build the energy body.\n\nWhen you can see whitish light all around you, you've come up the other side and are in the orange zone.\n\nNow  here's a troublesome point.\n\nSorcerers use seeing to teach. Otherwise they have to use their own thinking, which causes  them to care, and make mistakes.  If they just see how to teach, then intent is doing the teaching.\n\nI mentioned early on that I follow intent, which was to say, don't think I'm doing in here what I would like to do.  That's a good way to drain all of your energy.\n\nSo one theory of what's happening, won't agree with that same topic, for another student.\n\nOr I suppose you could say, what would appeal to Cholita for a lesson is absolutely nothing like what would appeal to me.\n\nAnd it's a problem.  We're making general instructions.\n\nSo all we can do is make sure they agree with the intent Carlos passed on, in books and lecture notes.\n\nSo, let's follow this reasoning.  It's possibly risky, but any risk to a student comes at much higher levels of sorcery, and it might get them there faster, so it's worth the risk.\n\nFirst, the energy body is built from energy redeployed from inside the shell.\n\nAnd, although i disagree with it, the energy body IS the double.\n\nThat means, the puffs are the double...Carlos said it's wandering around in infinity somewhere, and even a sorcerer can't usually locate it.\n\nThe value of a witch like Cholita is that her double comes to check out what her tonal is up to, once in a while.\n\nWhen it does, that means the puffs inside her, have moved closer to the center.\n\nThe reason we get \"double assist\" in the darkroom, is because we're redeploying puffs onto our torso.\n\nWe mistakenly believe that the double won't show up, until that process is done.\n\nBut in fact, every tiny bit of  puff you place on your torso, gives you a tiny bit more of the double's power.\n\nThus, in the  orange zone, we aren't done with the energy body.\n\nIt dissipates as we use it for seeing.\n\nIt's why the orange zone decays into the pink zone so easily.  Puffs evaporate off, and back into the middle of the space between our tonal and the limits of the shell.\n\nIn the orange zone, we need to keep redeploying if we want to stay solid and whole, with the double's powers.\n\nThe whitish light is visible  when we have virtually ALL of those puffs on our torso, and it gets weaker when it starts to evaporate off.\n\nSo if you see a cool disturbance in the air, you can go ahead and turn it into something.  But when you are done with it, scoop it back onto your body by quadrant.\n\nYou can even scoop IOB manifestations there.\n\nI have 3 now (plus Minx, who is not happy tonight).I did manage to put Lily on the left, and Fancy on the right.\n\nWasn't easy.\n\nIt looked like little girl enemies in school, made to sit next to each other in class. Then I realized my mistake.  Mystery needs to go on top, so Lily and Fancy ought to have been on the lower pouches.\n\nIn the red zone, you can grab a puff, flatten it, and use it for seeing.\n\nFancy had taught me that, it's in the post on shapeshifting.  The thing the man in the picture is holding in his hand.\n\nBut you can also do that by simply raising your hand or palm up, to cause it to generate some pinkish or purple light next to it.\n\nThe problem with \"puff assisted seeing\" is that the relationship of the puff to the seeing, contains depth information.\n\nYou'd have to gaze into a puff and see stuff, to understand that point.\n\nWe need the puffs on our torso in order to get the whitish light.  Which doesn't have the false depth information.\n\nThat depth info takes it into a new phantom realm, so it's not the best kind of seeing.  You're trying to see something but the puff being located away from you, creates a new tunnel of stuff to see, and distracts the goal.\n\nThe whitish light is in front of you, like a haze. So you're looking at the real world, and not deviating the current skimming of emanations by producing a new one.\n\nA trick: You can't see a tree by your own power.\n\nOr skills.\n\nI suppose an experienced sorcerer can do that, but not a beginner.\n\nBetter to just find the whitish light on a flat surface between you and the tree, and let that version of \"the wall\" simply materialize a little dream vision, with what you wanted to see.\n\nYou escape the orange zone when you find the abstract.\n\nOddly, you don't escape it when the double shows up.\n\nIn fact, the double is just the puffs you were playing with.  He's been there ever since you escaped the blue zone.\n\nThe blue zone river of filth is all of our concerns, our understanding of the false narratives socialization has imposed on us,  and the internal dialogue we've built to keep track of it.\n\nIt's such a horrible place, we have to keep that dialogue going just to stay there.\n\nAnd we can't do it all day, so we dream at night.  Or hallucinate when we get too weak to concentrate on the dialogue.\n\nFor this reason, family is especially bad for sorcerers.\n\nOn the one hand, if you convince them sorcery is true you just took a sledge hammer to whatever is soothing them and allowing them to survive the river of filth.\n\nGod, Jesus, Buddha, angels,  satanic sex parties, religious hatred.\n\nWanted to try to get them all in here.\n\nBut if sorcery is true, all of those are pointless.\n\nWhich is why sorcerers are dangerous to normal people.\n\nThey're stuck in the river of filth, and anything outside it is very threatening to them.  As in cry yourself to sleep at night, if someone takes Jesus away from you.\n\nSo we can't really have an honest interaction with them, which isn't fair to us.  We're forced to lie constantly.\n\nThus stalking.  To turn a bad situation into an opportunity to gain more emptiness in the face of the pissing and pooping on each other, which is the one constant in the blue zone.\n\nThey on the other hand are dangerous to sorcerers, because they only know the world in terms of the river of filth.  Every interaction is mostly an attempt to pull you back into the river, or get something out of you, which makes their life there less horrible.\n\nFor many, that means pooping on you.\n\nI suppose, pissing is the milder type of interaction.", "edited": 1636303219.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hjnjgoo", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out, if you want to redo darkroom instructions, continuous seeing mode (deep orange zone) is very useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as usual, you end up quitting darkroom to write it down.  Not good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like being trapped in the red zone!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turns out, the J curve process can be described as a series of &amp;quot;tasks&amp;quot;. But understand, once you do something like that, you have created a phantom reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is all Olmec sorcery really is.  A phantom reality the Olmecs came up with. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s pretend.  All of reality has been created by the intent of beings using those emanations. One way of looking at the emanations is no more valid than another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question is, does that view trap you in a hellish existence?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the top of the J curve is the blue zone.  A very hellish place. Don Juan called it &amp;quot;the river of filth&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep.  It&amp;#39;s so obvious.  I hadn&amp;#39;t put it together yet, but advanced dark roomers will realize it. We lose people to the attempt to escape that river (the blue zone).  Some try to find things other than the glowing colorful puffs, because they&amp;#39;re anxious to find something to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t flaw that, they&amp;#39;re just being observant.  But the motivation is 100% river of filth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others are dreaming of their book deal, or their loyal students sitting at their feet, giving them donations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women might tend to think of some idyllic social structure, where they can find a specialty for themselves and have less turmoil in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we need to emphasize escaping all that noisy internal dialogue (the river of filth narrative). So maybe portray the puffs of color as life preservers tossed into the river of filth, and you have to find one of those, and cling (gaze at) to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have escaped the river of filth when you can scoop a puff and place it anywhere on your torso.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next would be to rebuild your energy body. That&amp;#39;s a red zone activity because the puffs are most vivid in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Puffs exist in the orange zone, but they&amp;#39;re crystalline dreaming fog left overs. So you&amp;#39;d be scooping mini-dreams and tiny women&amp;#39;s faces (IOBs) onto your torso.  Which is fine, but not good for a beginner to think about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, when don Juan kept the IOBs in his gourd on his belt,  it turns out you don&amp;#39;t have to be in the Tonal to do that.  Your energy body can also &amp;quot;attach&amp;quot; them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you escape the green zone and arrive in red proper, when you can see your energy body as a vague glow.    Of course when you can see that, you&amp;#39;ll be fairly deep in the red zone, and the puffs will be spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s probably a good idea to scoop puffs by quadrants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upper/lower and Left/right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 3 pouches correspond to those quadrants, if you keep in mind the top pouch is actually both adrenals, on either side.  So it&amp;#39;s more like 2 pouches stuck together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus if you see a puff up high on the left, put that on your left breast.  Far right and below the belly button, put that on the pouch on the right, the one over the liver.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You escape the red zone, by clearing out all puffs.  So that there&amp;#39;s nothing left to scoop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point you will be in a phantom room, however it&amp;#39;s best to see this as the inside of your shell.  The one you redeployed energy from, towards the center of your body.  To build the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you can see whitish light all around you, you&amp;#39;ve come up the other side and are in the orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now  here&amp;#39;s a troublesome point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers use seeing to teach. Otherwise they have to use their own thinking, which causes  them to care, and make mistakes.  If they just see how to teach, then intent is doing the teaching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mentioned early on that I follow intent, which was to say, don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m doing in here what I would like to do.  That&amp;#39;s a good way to drain all of your energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So one theory of what&amp;#39;s happening, won&amp;#39;t agree with that same topic, for another student.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or I suppose you could say, what would appeal to Cholita for a lesson is absolutely nothing like what would appeal to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s a problem.

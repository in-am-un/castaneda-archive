Stuff no one will believe when you tell them about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s mostly a result of doing 2 hours at a time, so that the assemblage point can move all the way to the orange zone on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you could probably make it to the green zone where inorganic beings start to try to interject false memories into your recap, in just 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve got the right idea that silence is the key!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason recap hasn&amp;#39;t worked at all (as far as I can tell) for anyone in the Cleargreen crowd, is they&amp;#39;re just fantasizing the whole time and not realizing you can be silent while remembering the events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus most likely they lie about how much recap they do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without the super cool magic, anyone would eventually decide it was silly and Carlos made it all up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if they were earning a living off it, they&amp;#39;d never admit that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to get 3 Mojitos each into Reni and Nyei and ask them, &amp;quot;What the hell went wrong with you two??!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita would answer honestly after that.  I&amp;#39;ve done it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except she&amp;#39;s capable of becoming angry and doing real magic right in my face to prove I&amp;#39;m the one who doesn&amp;#39;t know anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still I don&amp;#39;t expect either Reni nor Nyei has been hiding super powers all this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once tunnels to the inorganic being realms open up in front of your eyes, your double teleports you across the house, or the inorganic beings try to tempt you with fabulous wealth (a far left shift), recap is anything but boring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know about using a cellphone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used paper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;darkroom&amp;quot; where a cell phone would burn an image into your eyes, so I can&amp;#39;t see anything wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just that the list tends to EXPAND, not shrink, for at least 3 months.  And that&amp;#39;s with 2 hour sessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typing on a cellphone will never equal the speed you can write on paper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had not only paper on which things were written, but a little trash bin next to the comfy armchair, inside a crate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a sense of accomplishment each time I got to throw away a paper that  had events on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also crossing them off as I went.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the witches said you get to burn those pages if you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being the case, I personally recommend small notepads so you get to toss out a sheet more often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ringed at the top kind, where you tear off a little sheet whenever you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also easier to hold in your hand as you are recapping, and a sharpened down halfway  pencil fits nicely in the rings of some of the binders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might keep some nicotine gum in the crate just in case you begin to lose concentration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a reason native americans put tobacco in their pipes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yxu4xzsj5z1c1.png?width=350&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=83b888d0709eadc91926718abad949dd44af628a\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/yxu4xzsj5z1c1.png?width=350&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=83b888d0709eadc91926718abad949dd44af628a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course if you wanted to go high tech you could make a python ap that reads the next line from google notes, and deletes it when you tell it that one is finished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to duplicate &amp;quot;Teddy&amp;quot; from the movie A.I. using a Raspberry Pi 5 to see how slow its responses are so I know if a Tensor Array processing hardware assistant could bring it up to real time interactions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/181jwog/question_on_recapitulation_balancing_the/kad0qnj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1700691754.0, "media_metadata": {"yxu4xzsj5z1c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 145, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yxu4xzsj5z1c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7ee411edba688dbfad4217e513b80ecabd489ba"}, {"y": 290, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yxu4xzsj5z1c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af125e4fb09dfd203e54878b3dbc8f373847e029"}, {"y": 430, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yxu4xzsj5z1c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=515366744aa1b6eb61ba448ed5252cd80ab676ee"}], "s": {"y": 471, "x": 350, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yxu4xzsj5z1c1.png?width=350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b888d0709eadc91926718abad949dd44af628a"}, "id": "yxu4xzsj5z1c1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_181jwog", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 17}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kadit8k", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SignificantResult3", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1700699476.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kad0dew", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_7ipyfg", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I will do away with the phone and print the list for each session.

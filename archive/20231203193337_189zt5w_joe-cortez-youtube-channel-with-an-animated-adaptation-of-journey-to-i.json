It was a secret, but the word was out. \n\nAll of a sudden a limousine passed with blonde guy with light colored eyes  that gave courses in nagualism and usurped the personality of Carlos. She  screamed, \u201cLook, it\u2019s Castaneda!\u201d, and ran out running to the car. But the  guy did not even look at her. He scorned her. The girl returned crying next  to Joe Cortez. He hugged her and counseled her, \u201cCalm down. Don\u2019t you  worry.

His way of life is similar to that of a  recluse. Carlos seems ideally suited for it. His supposed advocacy of drugs  is very wrong. He doesn't smoke or even drink wine. \n\n\"Privacy is part of his persona and his work and his being,\" Nelson  continued. \"Yet he's probably the most open man I've ever met in talking  about his feelings. \n\n\"One facet of his personality is Joe Cortez, the gardener.

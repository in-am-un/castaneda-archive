As an example, I might be looking at a shape that resembles what you would see if you looked at a single celled creature that had been blown up to about 2 feet wide by 1 feet high, and was made entirely out of fibers of light, but with well defined boundaries, perhaps even an encasing membrane.\n\nThe scene seems to end either when I'm disturbed by something in the room, or I wear it out, by getting all the facts I'm going to get..

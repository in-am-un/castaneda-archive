It was filled with wondrous sights.\n\nBut we can't remember back far enough to realize that the amazing sights we saw as infants weren't triggered by any \"suggestions\" or delusions.  It wasn't the power of the imagination causing magic to surround  us.  We knew nothing of this realm!\n\nIn fact it's how reality works.\n\nAs adults, we're so far away from that period in our lives that we can't even imagine what it was like.\n\nBut you can sort of see it by watching where very young children, even up to 1 year old, focus their attention.  Watch what they watch.\n\nThey're almost like the image of the blind monk, gazing around and seeing so much more than the sighted people.\n\nBut we \"train\" them to do tricks for mommy and daddy, insisting they stop gazing off into places in the room which have \"nothing going on\".\n\nIt's embarrassing for the parents if their baby just stares off into space, and won't acknowledge the older humans around it.\n\nAnd so the first significant brainwashing we receive from our social order, is the idea that there are places it's ok to look, and places it's not ok to look.  Or you will be judged.\n\nThe baby who looks the wrong direction for too long comes under assault. Fingers snapped in front of its eyes, hands clapped. A shout from a distance aways, \"Hey baby, look over here!\"\n\nWe don't see it that way at all.  We've been trained to see it as part of a complicated pattern of beneficial behavior.  Grandparent visits with toys and needed cash for the parents.   Neighbors who can watch the kids when needed but not if the kids are \"weirdos\".\n\nI can't name all the fascinating social pressures on us from the very first day we're born.\n\nYou almost have to see those with your own eyes to understand how insidious our brain washing really is.\n\nWhich is ok!  In Silent Knowledge that happens.  Knowledge on any topic, real or phantom, flows to you in response to your curiosity.\n\nOne of my favorite movie characters is Sherlock Holmes.  I like the way he gets a pipe filled with nicotine and smokes himself into a trance while pondering all the facts available to him, trying to rearrange it into the answer to,  who committed the crime?\n\nI acknowledge that his obsession with crimes and wrongdoings isn't helpful to sorcerers.  It's yet more of our oppressive socialization, and could be included in the category of \"Where it's ok to look, and where it's not.\"\n\nBut still, he tries to induce Silent Knowledge using tobacco, or worse.  In some versions he likes to inject himself with narcotics in his pursuit of knowledge.\n\nSilent Knowledge must indeed be very much like his thinking process at times.  And in the books of Carlos, don Juan tells us so.  He explains how \"seeing\" most of the time is just stuff you already ought to have known, were you \"worth  your salt\" as a sorcerer.\n\nKeep that in mind when you have doubts about whether something is silent knowledge or not.  Yes, you should already have known that.  But most  silent knowledge is like that. Except perhaps the rare cases where your silent knowledge focuses on someone else's past.  And so it's easy to verify if it's correct, and easy to see that you had no way of knowing that beforehand.\n\nI believe don Juan says the same about the dreaming emissary.\n\nAnd the \"voice of seeing\".\n\nAll of those are simply more manifestations of the same thing:  Silent Knowledge.\n\nYou might say that silent knowledge is our real \"brain\".  A place where all knowledge is stored, and can never be lost.  A place you can tap into using internal silence.\n\nPlus a hell of a lot of hard work to perfect that ability...\n\nSo out there is the highest achievement of Man. To tap into everything ever known, or perhaps even everything that ever COULD be known.\n\nWe got the example in Star Wars, with Yoda staring off into space searching to see how Anakin is doing.  Anakin being a \"concern\" of his, since in that movie series Anakin is seduced by the dark uses of \"the force\".  Abuse of \"personal power\".\n\nThe Jedi walk a tightrope between developing sorcery super powers, or being seduced by them until your behavior is taken over by an oppressive intelligence which wants to dominate everything around it.\n\nI never did figure out the analogy in that, to our situation. So much else in that movie series was taken directly from the books of Carlos.\n\nBut I can't figure what that \"dark side\" relates to.  We have a very dark side in our community. The greedy pretenders.\n\nBut they have no actual power.\n\nI suppose if \"the fliers\" are real, that's close enough to a dark side influencing humans.\n\nThe main thing here is, Yoda stares off into space where \"there's nothing to see\" and doesn't care.\n\nHe's receiving silent knowledge.  He even turns his  head in various directions, searching the places you aren't supposed to look for specific knowledge he needs.\n\nYou'll be doing that if you keep practicing darkroom!  I prefer to use the recapitulation head sweep movement. Searching the darkness for flickers or speckles.\n\nCarlos called it \"seeing energy\".\n\nSo one might say, the first assault on magic for an infant born here is to train them where it's ok to look and where it is not.  And for how long.\n\nThat oppressive view of how our consciousness works is like shaming children with clothes.\n\nNow, I'm not big on everyone running around naked.\n\nThose Olmec old seer loin clothes?  That's a deal killer for me.\n\nBut we do have our members who are fine with nudity.\n\nIt's just that, clothes are also a bit like that rule on where it's ok for a baby to look.\n\nIt's ok for a baby to look into the eyes of everyone around it, and ignore everything else.\n\nTo ignore it's amazing superpowers to view possibilities outside our normal flow of sensory data.\n\nBut most of all, it needs to learn to ignore the monster in the closet.\n\nThat's perhaps the next significant perceptual rule adults inflict on small children.\n\nTo make sure they can't have any friends, who don't come from around here.\n\nAren't members of our modern social cult.\n\nSo baby is taught where to look, and where it's not ok to look for very long.\n\nThen even when he's supposedly getting ready to sleep at night and the room is darkened, and the social rules ought to be relaxed so that he can prepare for dreaming where no one can control what you perceive, a bit of the dream world escapes into his waking world.\n\nThere's a monster in the closet!\n\nA friend actually.  We may not like fright as adults, but children can get used to it the same as sorcerers do.  And even like it, when it's a supernatural friend hiding in the closet.\n\nSome get hooked on the creepy feeling of dark energy.  The males especially.\n\nI'm not sure how women react to the monster in the closet.   I suspect it's different than that of men.\n\nBut we aren't allowed to have such spirit friends.  It's against the very tenants of our religions.\n\nExcept for those closer to our source,  as hunter/gatherer peoples.\n\nBefore money, there was shamanism.  Proto-religion.\n\nThe pursuit of magical knowledge, without a greedy motivation.\n\nAn honest exploration of \"what is\", rather than what's profitable.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how once money was invented, the truth was doomed.\n\nThe truth of our reality is too vast to control.  There are too many places for baby to look that produce amazing sights.\n\nAnd no way for anyone else to go there with the baby.\n\nSo we forbid those, hoping baby will be pressured to obey or risk not having any friends.\n\nAnd when a child finds magical friends who will disagree with the social rules on where and what it's ok to perceive, we punish it over that discovery.\n\nRemove the possibility of having non-human friends who don't care about our social order.  And who only like to explore all those places baby is not supposed to look.\n\nThe inorganic beings, like the old Olmec seers, prefer to start teaching sorcery to infants.  Who don't resist and only care about how much fun it is to perceive completely new things.\n\nThe first assault on our ability to be sorcerers and witches, explorers of the real reality, is to tell us where it's ok to look and where it's not.\n\nWhile the second is to tell us that spirits are not real and that only the humans, pets, and wildlife around us are real.\n\nThe giant copy of Big Bird who seems obsessed with grabbing the child?\n\nNot real.\n\nLucifer under a pile of clothes creeping closer and closer to your bed, pitchfork ready to strike?\n\nNot real.\n\nIt doesn't matter what you saw!  Or even if you felt it.\n\nIt's not real!!!\n\nEven though the baby can see with it's own eyes that it IS real.  And can even lift him up in the bed to shake him.\n\nOur socialization is a series of assaults on our perceptual freedom.\n\nThe boys quickly accept this, because at some genetic level they're programmed to try to dominate the people around them.\n\nTo grow up to be leader of the tribe.\n\nIt's necessary for survival that the strongest male becomes in charge of the group. It's true in the animal kingdoms too.\n\nThat way groups with the best genetics in their leader, are more likely to survive and reproduce.\n\nHelpling us to evolve to be more and more intelligent and physically capable.\n\nMeanwhile the tribe needs the women to manage social matters, to insure a smooth flow of food and protection to offspring.  And there's something else odd going on with the women, involving \"attractiveness\". The men have to be attracted to their mate, since only the males have the enhanced strength.  They can't exactly wrestle women to find their mate.  It wouldn't be selective since they can dominate all of them with physical strength.\n\nThe women have to be \"attractive\".  Which is also a very positive feature of our genetics.\n\nIt causes us to sort of morph over time, to be better and better looking to the eyes.\n\nI'm not sure what the practical gain of that is, but there's sure to be one.  Maybe it's merely that you have to enjoy life in order to tolerate the ups and downs.  And so the contribution of the women to the gene pool is not so much bigger muscles or better intelligence or figuring out how to capture wild animals for food, but to make the whole thing more relaxing and enjoyable in the off hours.  When raising children.\n\nThe men and women quickly go their separate ways, from a perceptual and behavioral point of view.\n\nAt parties, once their search for mates is over with,  they even stand on opposite ends of the room. Tending to collect together based on shared common interests.\n\nSome of which are biologically motivated.\n\nNow's where this gets a bit weird.\n\nBoth the men and the women grow into full on socialization knowing what's ok, what's not ok, and what kind of behavior gets the most rewards.\n\nSo everything ought to be fine.  For all parties.\n\nBut the women are under assault each month.\n\nTheir biology pushes them into weird realms.\n\nIt's not a big deal.  There's plants all around us which if eaten can propel you into bizarre sorcery like realms.\n\nEven growing in your yard are likely plants that work as well as any street drug.\n\nAnd if you catch a virus, the high fever that results can push you off into very bizarre waking dreams. We call them feverish visions.\n\nThe women are subjected to a tiny bit of that, each month.\n\nSome more than others.\n\nAs a result, their perceptions of the world never quite become \"written in stone\" as do those of the men.\n\nThere's always \"outside stuff\" trying to break in to their consciousness.\n\nWomen are natural witches.  They can never quite fully settle into the social reality we were born into, because their very biology rejects it from time to time.\n\nAnd that can be so unpleasant that they have no choice but to learn to manipulate it.\n\nThey learn to self soothe.\n\nIce cream just isn't going to do it most of the time.  There's the \"ice cream hangover\" for one thing.\n\nSame for drugs.  You can't use those to overcome the monthly pain, without making things worse.\n\nSo they resort to the smelly bath surrounded by candles and flowers, and learn about spells and witchcraft.  Or they just curl up in a ball on the couch, and try to find a path out of the suffering caused by their monthly cycle.  Exploring inside their own consciousness, for  solutions to the \"bad place\" they've fallen into.\n\nIt is 100% inevitable that women are witches.\n\nAnd if our religions hadn't risen up to condemn that activity, it wouldn't sound so silly to make that statement.\n\nCholita had to explain it to me. She said Florinda taught her.\n\nALL WOMEN ARE WITCHES, if they just **know** it.\n\nAnd from personal experience I can tell you, the women who deny that or find it absurd are the ones who crash the hardest later in life.\n\nIf women are like chocolate, the ones with the \"colorful hard candy shell\" melt the worst in the long run.  At least the pure chocolate variety has crystalline structure for withstanding heat a while.\n\nThat's both a reference to M&amp;Ms, and to Born Again Christian women who have a \"loving spiritual marriage\".\n\nThose crash the hardest when they find out it's not real.  How thin the hard candy shell really is.\n\nWhat is a witch anyway?\n\nA witch is a person who seeks to influence things around them, by looking where you aren't supposed to look and communicating with beings you aren't allowed to acknowledge.\n\nThey use \"seeing\", and inorganic beings to enhance their daily existence.\n\nAnd in so doing they discover the very thing that sorcerers seek.\n\nIntent.\n\nIntent is what makes their spells result in magic.\n\nNot often enough of course.  And not reliably.\n\nAnd so in general, the men reject that sort of thing.\n\nAs we've learned from our own magical history, and that of the Daoists, sorcerers are not invulnerable to attack.\n\nThe Olmec seers thought they were.  They could travel freely between worlds. And attack other humans using supernatural spirits.\n\nThe Daoists thought the same and when the communists rose in China and sought to dominate all influences on society, the Daoists stood up to their guns.  Convinced nothing could harm them.\n\nAnd were nearly all killed.\n\nI suppose something similar happened to our Olmecs, driving them off into other civilizations down further into south America.\n\nIf you seek to dominate the tribe, obsession with sorcery is not nearly as effective as physical strength and a well planned attack using ordinary means.  With the mass of a large tribe behind you.\n\nThe male push to take over the tribe runs contrary to the search for knowledge of magic.\n\nBut for the women, it does not.  They're forced to use magic to \"self-sooth\" on a regular basis, and in the process of doing that they discover witchcraft and the fact that it really can alter events around them, through the manipulation of that intelligent force of \"intent\".\n\nThe problem the women have is \"doubt\".  Sorcery realms are filled to the brink with doubt.\n\nIf you work hard at darkroom, you'll learn that lesson the hard way.\n\nSeeking real magic and actually getting it daily but finding it's difficult to remember,  that you can't make it repeat, no one around you is interested in your amazing discoveries, and you can't find a reliable way to use the power you learn in a different reality to alter the events of this reality.\n\nThe only thing that can bridge that gap between and effect in one reality, and the same in another, is perhaps \"intent\".   It can copy over the required glowing emanations.\n\nBut the mastery of intent takes decades.\n\nMeaning, both men and women can stray from the social path they were born into, but the rewards will be long in coming.  Nothing of obvious immediate benefit is contained in sorcery or witchcraft.\n\nSo they're off on the side as weird hobbies for socially awkward people.\n\nNow the men learn to manipulate those around them, with ideas.\n\nAs males they want to take over the tribe.\n\nAnd a big tree branch to smash over the heads of your opponents works great if you are the strongest.\n\nBut at the end of a bloody battle it's nice to have supporters come help you to a hut, so you can heal from your injuries.\n\nSo not only do you have to bash people over the head better than the other guy, but you need others to help you survive the injuries.\n\nAnd one way to insure that is through religion.\n\nYou invent the idea of a supernatural tribal chief even more powerful than all the human rulers in existence.\n\nOne who can reward or punish you forever.\n\nGod.  Shiva.  A flying snake with feathers.\n\nIn the case of the Chinese, they created a heavenly hierarchy which included the emperor.  Giving him \"divine authority\".\n\nEven the British Royal Family is based on the idea that they are direct descendants of the Jewish King David, making them key figures in \"God's Plan\" since he promised there would always be a man to sit on that thorne, until the end of the world.\n\nWhen I was a child on indian reservations, it was the Kachina spirits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Palm Springs Art Museum, just south of where Carlos started his search for don Juan.](https://preview.redd.it/wpxekfwjjtca1.png?width=2290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e8d3673afa8f42a153cc6196c2c75e2b48d2e61)\n\nWhatever the excuse, religions are a very convenient way for a tribal leader to insure loyalty from the people around him.\n\nBut the people need to be convinced the tribal leader really has the facts on this invincible being who rules over all chiefs and has the power to make your future eternally happy, or to punish you forever with endless suffering.\n\nThe tribal leader needs a shaman associate to talk to the people about spirits and Gods. Threaten them really.\n\nAnd how those beings want them to obey the chief. And while they're at it, follow some nice rules the shaman gets to come up with himself. That's his reward in it all.\n\nSuch as, bringing him food in tribute to the Gods.\n\nIf he's a \"Rinpoche\" magic man, bring him gold coins and jewels.  Cholita can tell stories about that type of fraud.\n\nHumans inevitably end up with 2 parasites living off their group efforts.\n\nThe male leaders, and their \"magic man prophets\".\n\nIt's a dirty male oriented business.\n\nThe ordinary women are somewhat familiar with what the crazy drug addict shaman \"prophet\" is doing.\n\nAnd we have to acknowledge that shaman leaders come in both sexes.\n\nBut even the average woman who is not a \"magic leader\" perceives magical realms as a result of her troublesome biology.\n\nMeanwhile the male shaman priest is involved in show business.\n\nHe has to tell stories that don't change.  So that everyone can memorize them, accept them, and pass them on to their children. The easiest ones to brainwash so well they take it to heart.\n\nThe religious leader can't be changing his story from month to month.\n\nRealizing one month that the deity he told them to pay tribute to the last month is not actually what he thought it was.\n\nSomething that naturally occurs over and over again, when REAL magic is being practiced.\n\nIt took thousands of years for the Olmec's magic to reach our level.\n\nBut \"religions\" are cooked up in a single generation.\n\nThe priest has to provide a false sense that spirit realms are like our own socialized realm of acceptable and reliable behavior. That \"over there\", it's very much like over here.\n\nBut it's not like that in other realities!\n\nEach one is different, the rules change, your physical body changes, and it's extremely difficult to learn to \"hold one\" steadily,  long enough to even learn the rules there.\n\nWe have a terrible time teaching sorcery because of that.\n\nA simple technology, very easy to understand and which produces astonishing results if you practice it.\n\nBut it's notoriously unreliable.\n\nNot because it's  imaginary or \"not true\".\n\nBut because of our very nature to travel between tens of thousands of alternate versions of our current reality, including 600 actual alternate copies of our own self out there, into which we can transfer our consciousness and theoretically choose to live there permanently.\n\nI don't know about that permanent part from my own experience, but you can certainly visit.  Even for weeks.\n\nReality is VAST.  It's not so much that there's this one we have, and then there's \"the spirit realm\".\n\nOr \"the heavenly realm\".\n\nWe like to put limits on the madness and the crazy shaman leader of the tribe can't keep telling a different story each week.\n\nPeople want to hear that the spirit realm is just as reliable as this realm, only hidden from their sight.\n\nSo the shaman prophet is forced to lie about what he claims to be able to do.\n\nEven if he sincerely becomes interested in exploring the truth of our endless choices for a reality to perceive, he can't help control the people of a tribe by telling the truth.\n\nThey'll decide he's simply crazy, and not wise at all.\n\nThe shaman leaders, the prophets, and the priests, are all in the business of lying.\n\nThere is no other for them.\n\nIf you fall for their lies, you can't proceed on the path of sorcery.  It's an unresolvable contradiction of the truth of the situation we're in.\n\nBecause reality is infinitely complex.  Not simple, and not at all like this world we were born into.\n\nIn fact, most of what humans can perceive cannot even be translated into words.\n\nIt's off in \"the abstract\".\n\nUnderstand this:  All religions are lies.\n\nThey can't be anything else.\n\nAt least, once you realize that the assemblage point can move and reality itself changes around you, you come to realize that \"meaning\" and \"truth\" are just points in space.  With no value once you stray far from that location.\n\nAnd the priest is in the business of lying about that.\n\nSo here come the two biggest assaults on witches possible.\n\nI'm afraid, I myself am totally guilty of one in regards to Cholita.\n\nShe's a powerful witch, but I'm involved in a battle to save sorcery from attack by religion.\n\nAnd so the symbols of those religions are odious to me.\n\nWhen I get a new follower on social media and see a Yin/Yang symbol in their user id, I know that person is likely going to attack.\n\nThey don't want to read that they're delusional, and have been tricked by the lying priests.\n\nDoesn't matter what symbols. Even if it's Jewish Qaballa or the grinning Buddha man.\n\nAny symbol from the priests means the person displaying it has been taken in by lies.\n\nBrainwashed. And will feel entitled to attack if their religious beliefs are not at least \"respected\".\n\nNot realizing, that kind of thinking prevents the possibility to learn sorcery.\n\nCholita of course is just building a smelly bubble bath with pink champagne and candles all around her.  Filling her environment with reminders that magic exists.\n\nWith her religion's decorations to hint at \"what if\".  Or, \"there's magic in the world\".\n\nSymbols and decorations to remind her that it's possible to explore realms outside our ordinary reality.\n\nAnd I want to instead saddle her with male reasoning saying, \"That shit doesn't work!  Don't you know that's unreliable and has no actual power at all, other than some tiny feel good sensations?\"\n\nIn fact, it's the tiny feel good sensations she seeks in it.\n\nBecause those move her assemblage point, and other realities become visible.\n\nBut the male leaders can't have that sort of tolerant outlook, because their key to power is to control the beliefs of those around them.\n\nThe big tribal chief with the largest muscles actually has no power at all, if his people won't pick him up after battle and help him to heal.\n\nSo the real power rests with the priests.\n\nAnd they don't like to have their \"story\" doubted.\n\nThey don't want to hear any questioning of their authority.\n\nSomeone might ask the priest,  \"But the people off in the yellow lands, have never seen your God of the white sands.  How do you explain that they have a different all powerful guiding spirit?\"\n\n\"They're evil!\", he'll reply.\n\nEven if he's very artful and disguises that message as something else.\n\nThat's the only thing the priest can possibly say.  He has to dismiss objections as a place you aren't supposed to look.  Because if you look away from where he needs you to look, then you have to be considered broken.\n\nUseless.\n\nA baby who stares off into space instead of smiling and doing tricks for the adults around it is a substandard quality baby.  A failure.\n\nThe priesthood creates the lie that the magical realms available to humans are just like this realm. Where the rules never change, and there is nothing beyond that new reality.\n\nIt's the \"top tribe\".  Nothing can ever be above it, or even just as good as it. It has to be exclusive.\n\nAnd to remain in power they have to create the idea that they have permanently figured out the highest truth.\n\nThere can't be more for them to learn, or it adds some doubt to their authority.\n\nThe priest must instill the belief in the people that his attainment of supernatural visions is permanent, the ultimate, and that his word is completely reliable and reflects perfectly the higher truth of our existence.\n\nBut in fact the \"higher truth\" of existence can never be reconciled with our current reality, because the multi-universe is not like that at all.\n\nA \"religion\" itself is a total assault on witches,  who can already perceive hints of the truth. The real truth.\n\nReality is up for grabs!\n\nA religion is an assault on women become it tells them that their very real magic and very real accomplishments in spiritual realms, driven by their need to sooth their troublesome biology, are invalid.\n\nEvil even.\n\nIn fact the priests needed to come up with new laws, to handle women who won't agree with them.\n\n\"Thou Shalt not Suffer a Witch To Live\".\n\nI won't go into the lame excuses Jewish Scholars come up with for that one.  The modern scholars realize that's a souce of shame in their religion.\n\nBut they play word games to make it seem as if it were never part of their \"law\".\n\nExcuses which basically don't hold up to their own religious narrative. Or even to their own religious history of witch burnings.\n\nWhich seems to be nearly universal all over the world.\n\nEven today witches are being burned.  Try Papua New Guinea for examples.   But it happens in small villages all over the world when some random misfortune is blamed on the village witch.\n\nWhat does this all mean?  Why should someone interested in sorcery care?\n\nBecause sorcery is not discovered in the realm of the reliable and repeatable.\n\nThat belief that it could be found there, is a male desire to dominate the tribe as the shaman priest.\n\nWith lies.\n\nThe lies in particular, attack women.\n\nBecause women naturally explore the unknown.  And learn to use it, if given a chance.\n\nCholita's favorite decorations may be pure nonsense, but it doesn't matter because they inspire her as much as the flowers and candles she loves.\n\nAnd she can summon \"intent\"!\n\nThey're part of an effort to make it easier to move her assemblage point, so as to influence the only actual force controlling the entire multiverse.\n\nIntent.\n\nThere is no reliable chief tribal leader or priest like God, over all realms of reality.\n\nVirtually all are not even human.  Some don't even have time or physical matter as we know it.\n\nAnd I've heard that even insects have some very lovely places to live.  And a path to freedom just as we've been granted by the spirit.\n\nAll of that is available to humans for exploring, but only witches naturally do it without having to become a hermit living in the desert for 40 years.\n\nThe achievements and value of women has been delegated to a status of \"evil\" or '\"delusional\" by the priests.\n\nBecause the tribal leader is not sufficiently powerful enough to stop witches.\n\nBut the priests are. They control the lynch mobs.\n\nAnd oddly, their strongest attacks on witches go completely unnoticed in the world of religion.\n\nEven our most powerful religious \"leaders\" are absolutely clueless of the harm they do to witches with their big lies.\n\nHow can it be that the  Dalai Lama, the Pope, and all historical leaders such as the Buddha, Lao Tsu  or Enoch, harm witches with their lies and are oblivious to it?\n\nAnd we accept their claims as sacred and wise?\n\nWhen in fact their two most insidious lies strike at the very heart of our ability to explore magic.\n\nWe first take away the power of infants by teaching them where to look, and that spirits don't exist.\n\nThen the religious leaders seal the fate of witches by teaching that there's a single higher reality.\n\nAnd that the authority to perceive such things is a permanent attainment.\n\nAnd that if you don't agree there's only one higher truth you haven't seen anything worth seeing.\n\nThey teach that what's \"out there\" is just like what's here, and anyone who sees it differently is \"broken\".\n\nWhere to look, which beings are ok for friends, that any attempt to rise above our reality must find a new version that's like this one, and that anyone who does such things successfully reaches that \"high state\" permanently, are the 4 main assaults on witches.\n\nTo berate their accomplishments so thoroughly that no one will listen to them.\n\nSo that they drown away in doubt.\n\nWe ought to try to fix that.\n\nA woman in the bathtub can kick the Dalai Lama's butt all day long.\n\nIn every magical and spiritual way imaginable.\n\nIf we want to undermine the priests and reduce male control, raise the witches up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title":

death as villagers watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was gazing out into the second attention fog just now, and had a series of realizations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For beginners, what happens is that in darkness there&amp;#39;s normally nothing to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over time as you learn to get silent, and also stop thinking about how famous you&amp;#39;ll become once you make this sorcery stuff work, you notice that darkness is never dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t as a child.  It was filled with wondrous sights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we can&amp;#39;t remember back far enough to realize that the amazing sights we saw as infants weren&amp;#39;t triggered by any &amp;quot;suggestions&amp;quot; or delusions.  It wasn&amp;#39;t the power of the imagination causing magic to surround  us.  We knew nothing of this realm!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact it&amp;#39;s how reality works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As adults, we&amp;#39;re so far away from that period in our lives that we can&amp;#39;t even imagine what it was like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can sort of see it by watching where very young children, even up to 1 year old, focus their attention.  Watch what they watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re almost like the image of the blind monk, gazing around and seeing so much more than the sighted people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we &amp;quot;train&amp;quot; them to do tricks for mommy and daddy, insisting they stop gazing off into places in the room which have &amp;quot;nothing going on&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s embarrassing for the parents if their baby just stares off into space, and won&amp;#39;t acknowledge the older humans around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so the first significant brainwashing we receive from our social order, is the idea that there are places it&amp;#39;s ok to look, and places it&amp;#39;s not ok to look.  Or you will be judged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The baby who looks the wrong direction for too long comes under assault. Fingers snapped in front of its eyes, hands clapped. A shout from a distance aways, &amp;quot;Hey baby, look over here!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t see it that way at all.  We&amp;#39;ve been trained to see it as part of a complicated pattern of beneficial behavior.  Grandparent visits with toys and needed cash for the parents.   Neighbors who can watch the kids when needed but not if the kids are &amp;quot;weirdos&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t name all the fascinating social pressures on us from the very first day we&amp;#39;re born.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You almost have to see those with your own eyes to understand how insidious our brain washing really is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is ok!  In Silent Knowledge that happens.  Knowledge on any topic, real or phantom, flows to you in response to your curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite movie characters is Sherlock Holmes.  I like the way he gets a pipe filled with nicotine and smokes himself into a trance while pondering all the facts available to him, trying to rearrange it into the answer to,  who committed the crime?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge that his obsession with crimes and wrongdoings isn&amp;#39;t helpful to sorcerers.  It&amp;#39;s yet more of our oppressive socialization, and could be included in the category of &amp;quot;Where it&amp;#39;s ok to look, and where it&amp;#39;s not.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still, he tries to induce Silent Knowledge using tobacco, or worse.  In some versions he likes to inject himself with narcotics in his pursuit of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge must indeed be very much like his thinking process at times.  And in the books of Carlos, don Juan tells us so.  He explains how &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; most of the time is just stuff you already ought to have known, were you &amp;quot;worth  your salt&amp;quot; as a sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep that in mind when you have doubts about whether something is silent knowledge or not.  Yes, you should already have known that.  But most  silent knowledge is like that. Except perhaps the rare cases where your silent knowledge focuses on someone else&amp;#39;s past.  And so it&amp;#39;s easy to verify if it&amp;#39;s correct, and easy to see that you had no way of knowing that beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe don Juan says the same about the dreaming emissary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;quot;voice of seeing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of those are simply more manifestations of the same thing:  Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might say that silent knowledge is our real &amp;quot;brain&amp;quot;.  A place where all knowledge is stored, and can never be lost.  A place you can tap into using internal silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus a hell of a lot of hard work to perfect that ability...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So out there is the highest achievement of Man. To tap into everything ever known, or perhaps even everything that ever COULD be known.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got the example in Star Wars, with Yoda staring off into space searching to see how Anakin is doing.  Anakin being a &amp;quot;concern&amp;quot; of his, since in that movie series Anakin is seduced by the dark uses of &amp;quot;the force&amp;quot;.  Abuse of &amp;quot;personal power&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jedi walk a tightrope between developing sorcery super powers, or being seduced by them until your behavior is taken over by an oppressive intelligence which wants to dominate everything around it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never did figure out the analogy in that, to our situation. So much else in that movie series was taken directly from the books of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t figure what that &amp;quot;dark side&amp;quot; relates to.  We have a very dark side in our community. The greedy pretenders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they have no actual power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose if &amp;quot;the fliers&amp;quot; are real, that&amp;#39;s close enough to a dark side influencing humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main thing here is, Yoda stares off into space where &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s nothing to see&amp;quot; and doesn&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s receiving silent knowledge.  He even turns his  head in various directions, searching the places you aren&amp;#39;t supposed to look for specific knowledge he needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be doing that if you keep practicing darkroom!  I prefer to use the recapitulation head sweep movement. Searching the darkness for flickers or speckles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos called it &amp;quot;seeing energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So one might say, the first assault on magic for an infant born here is to train them where it&amp;#39;s ok to look and where it is not.  And for how long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That oppressive view of how our consciousness works is like shaming children with clothes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m not big on everyone running around naked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those Olmec old seer loin clothes?  That&amp;#39;s a deal killer for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we do have our members who are fine with nudity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just that, clothes are also a bit like that rule on where it&amp;#39;s ok for a baby to look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s ok for a baby to look into the eyes of everyone around it, and ignore everything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To ignore it&amp;#39;s amazing superpowers to view possibilities outside our normal flow of sensory data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But most of all, it needs to learn to ignore the monster in the closet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s perhaps the next significant perceptual rule adults inflict on small children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make sure they can&amp;#39;t have any friends, who don&amp;#39;t come from around here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aren&amp;#39;t members of our modern social cult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So baby is taught where to look, and where it&amp;#39;s not ok to look for very long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then even when he&amp;#39;s supposedly getting ready to sleep at night and the room is darkened, and the social rules ought to be relaxed so that he can prepare for dreaming where no one can control what you perceive, a bit of the dream world escapes into his waking world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a monster in the closet!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A friend actually.  We may not like fright as adults, but children can get used to it the same as sorcerers do.  And even like it, when it&amp;#39;s a supernatural friend hiding in the closet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some get hooked on the creepy feeling of dark energy.  The males especially.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how women react to the monster in the closet.   I suspect it&amp;#39;s different than that of men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we aren&amp;#39;t allowed to have such spirit friends.  It&amp;#39;s against the very tenants of our religions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except for those closer to our source,  as hunter/gatherer peoples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before money, there was shamanism.  Proto-religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of magical knowledge, without a greedy motivation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An honest exploration of &amp;quot;what is&amp;quot;, rather than what&amp;#39;s profitable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t emphasize enough how once money was invented, the truth was doomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth of our reality is too vast to control.  There are too many places for baby to look that produce amazing sights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no way for anyone else to go there with the baby.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we forbid those, hoping baby will be pressured to obey or risk not having any friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when a child finds magical friends who will disagree with the social rules on where and what it&amp;#39;s ok to perceive, we punish it over that discovery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remove the possibility of having non-human friends who don&amp;#39;t care about our social order.  And who only like to explore all those places baby is not supposed to look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inorganic beings, like the old Olmec seers, prefer to start teaching sorcery to infants.  Who don&amp;#39;t resist and only care about how much fun it is to perceive completely new things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first assault on our ability to be sorcerers and witches, explorers of the real reality, is to tell us where it&amp;#39;s ok to look and where it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the second is to tell us that spirits are not real and that only the humans, pets, and wildlife around us are real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The giant copy of Big Bird who seems obsessed with grabbing the child?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucifer under a pile of clothes creeping closer and closer to your bed, pitchfork ready to strike?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t matter what you saw!  Or even if you felt it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not real!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though the baby can see with it&amp;#39;s own eyes that it IS real.  And can even lift him up in the bed to shake him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our socialization is a series of assaults on our perceptual freedom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The boys quickly accept this, because at some genetic level they&amp;#39;re programmed to try to dominate the people around them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To grow up to be leader of the tribe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s necessary for survival that the strongest male becomes in charge of the group. It&amp;#39;s true in the animal kingdoms too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That way groups with the best genetics in their leader, are more likely to survive and reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Helpling us to evolve to be more and more intelligent and physically capable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the tribe needs the women to manage social matters, to insure a smooth flow of food and protection to offspring.  And there&amp;#39;s something else odd going on with the women, involving &amp;quot;attractiveness&amp;quot;. The men have to be attracted to their mate, since only the males have the enhanced strength.  They can&amp;#39;t exactly wrestle women to find their mate.  It wouldn&amp;#39;t be selective since they can dominate all of them with physical strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women have to be &amp;quot;attractive&amp;quot;.  Which is also a very positive feature of our genetics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It causes us to sort of morph over time, to be better and better looking to the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what the practical gain of that is, but there&amp;#39;s sure to be one.  Maybe it&amp;#39;s merely that you have to enjoy life in order to tolerate the ups and downs.  And so the contribution of the women to the gene pool is not so much bigger muscles or better intelligence or figuring out how to capture wild animals for food, but to make the whole thing more relaxing and enjoyable in the off hours.  When raising children.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The men and women quickly go their separate ways, from a perceptual and behavioral point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At parties, once their search for mates is over with,  they even stand on opposite ends of the room. Tending to collect together based on shared common interests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of which are biologically motivated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now&amp;#39;s where this gets a bit weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both the men and the women grow into full on socialization knowing what&amp;#39;s ok, what&amp;#39;s not ok, and what kind of behavior gets the most rewards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So everything ought to be fine.  For all parties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the women are under assault each month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their biology pushes them into weird realms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a big deal.  There&amp;#39;s plants all around us which if eaten can propel you into bizarre sorcery like realms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even growing in your yard are likely plants that work as well as any street drug.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you catch a virus, the high fever that results can push you off into very bizarre waking dreams. We call them feverish visions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women are subjected to a tiny bit of that, each month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some more than others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, their perceptions of the world never quite become &amp;quot;written in stone&amp;quot; as do those of the men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s always &amp;quot;outside stuff&amp;quot; trying to break in to their consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women are natural witches.  They can never quite fully settle into the social reality we were born into, because their very biology rejects it from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that can be so unpleasant that they have no choice but to learn to manipulate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They learn to self soothe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ice cream just isn&amp;#39;t going to do it most of the time.  There&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;ice cream hangover&amp;quot; for one thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for drugs.  You can&amp;#39;t use those to overcome the monthly pain, without making things worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they resort to the smelly bath surrounded by candles and flowers, and learn about spells and witchcraft.  Or they just curl up in a ball on the couch, and try to find a path out of the suffering caused by their monthly cycle.  Exploring inside their own consciousness, for  solutions to the &amp;quot;bad place&amp;quot; they&amp;#39;ve fallen into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is 100% inevitable that women are witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if our religions hadn&amp;#39;t risen up to condemn that activity, it wouldn&amp;#39;t sound so silly to make that statement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita had to explain it to me. She said Florinda taught her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ALL WOMEN ARE WITCHES, if they just &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And from personal experience I can tell you, the women who deny that or find it absurd are the ones who crash the hardest later in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If women are like chocolate, the ones with the &amp;quot;colorful hard candy shell&amp;quot; melt the worst in the long run.  At least the pure chocolate variety has crystalline structure for withstanding heat a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s both a reference to M&amp;amp;Ms, and to Born Again Christian women who have a &amp;quot;loving spiritual marriage&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those crash the hardest when they find out it&amp;#39;s not real.  How thin the hard candy shell really is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is a witch anyway?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A witch is a person who seeks to influence things around them, by looking where you aren&amp;#39;t supposed to look and communicating with beings you aren&amp;#39;t allowed to acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They use &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot;, and inorganic beings to enhance their daily existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in so doing they discover the very thing that sorcerers seek.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent is what makes their spells result in magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not often enough of course.  And not reliably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so in general, the men reject that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;#39;ve learned from our own magical history, and that of the Daoists, sorcerers are not invulnerable to attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Olmec seers thought they were.  They could travel freely between worlds. And attack other humans using supernatural spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Daoists thought the same and when the communists rose in China and sought to dominate all influences on society, the Daoists stood up to their guns.  Convinced nothing could harm them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And were nearly all killed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose something similar happened to our Olmecs, driving them off into other civilizations down further into south America.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you seek to dominate the tribe, obsession with sorcery is not nearly as effective as physical strength and a well planned attack using ordinary means.  With the mass of a large tribe behind you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The male push to take over the tribe runs contrary to the search for knowledge of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for the women, it does not.  They&amp;#39;re forced to use magic to &amp;quot;self-sooth&amp;quot; on a regular basis, and in the process of doing that they discover witchcraft and the fact that it really can alter events around them, through the manipulation of that intelligent force of &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem the women have is &amp;quot;doubt&amp;quot;.  Sorcery realms are filled to the brink with doubt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you work hard at darkroom, you&amp;#39;ll learn that lesson the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeking real magic and actually getting it daily but finding it&amp;#39;s difficult to remember,  that you can&amp;#39;t make it repeat, no one around you is interested in your amazing discoveries, and you can&amp;#39;t find a reliable way to use the power you learn in a different reality to alter the events of this reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that can bridge that gap between and effect in one reality, and the same in another, is perhaps &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;.   It can copy over the required glowing emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the mastery of intent takes decades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, both men and women can stray from the social path they were born into, but the rewards will be long in coming.  Nothing of obvious immediate benefit is contained in sorcery or witchcraft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they&amp;#39;re off on the side as weird hobbies for socially awkward people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the men learn to manipulate those around them, with ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As males they want to take over the tribe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a big tree branch to smash over the heads of your opponents works great if you are the strongest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the end of a bloody battle it&amp;#39;s nice to have supporters come help you to a hut, so you can heal from your injuries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So not only do you have to bash people over the head better than the other guy, but you need others to help you survive the injuries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one way to insure that is through religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You invent the idea of a supernatural tribal chief even more powerful than all the human rulers in existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One who can reward or punish you forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God.  Shiva.  A flying snake with feathers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Chinese, they created a heavenly hierarchy which included the emperor.  Giving him &amp;quot;divine authority&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the British Royal Family is based on the idea that they are direct descendants of the Jewish King David, making them key figures in &amp;quot;God&amp;#39;s Plan&amp;quot; since he promised there would always be a man to sit on that thorne, until the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was a child on indian reservations, it was the Kachina spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wpxekfwjjtca1.png?width=2290&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8e8d3673afa8f42a153cc6196c2c75e2b48d2e61\"&gt;Palm Springs Art Museum, just south of where Carlos started his search for don Juan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever the excuse, religions are a very convenient way for a tribal leader to insure loyalty from the people around him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the people need to be convinced the tribal leader really has the facts on this invincible being who rules over all chiefs and has the power to make your future eternally happy, or to punish you forever with endless suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tribal leader needs a shaman associate to talk to the people about spirits and Gods. Threaten them really.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And how those beings want them to obey the chief. And while they&amp;#39;re at it, follow some nice rules the shaman gets to come up with himself. That&amp;#39;s his reward in it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as, bringing him food in tribute to the Gods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;Rinpoche&amp;quot; magic man, bring him gold coins and jewels.  Cholita can tell stories about that type of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Humans inevitably end up with 2 parasites living off their group efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The male leaders, and their &amp;quot;magic man prophets&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a dirty male oriented business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ordinary women are somewhat familiar with what the crazy drug addict shaman &amp;quot;prophet&amp;quot; is doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we have to acknowledge that shaman leaders come in both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even the average woman who is not a &amp;quot;magic leader&amp;quot; perceives magical realms as a result of her troublesome biology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the male shaman priest is involved in show business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has to tell stories that don&amp;#39;t change.  So that everyone can memorize them, accept them, and pass them on to their children. The easiest ones to brainwash so well they take it to heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The religious leader can&amp;#39;t be changing his story from month to month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Realizing one month that the deity he told them to pay tribute to the last month is not actually what he thought it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something that naturally occurs over and over again, when REAL magic is being practiced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took thousands of years for the Olmec&amp;#39;s magic to reach our level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But &amp;quot;religions&amp;quot; are cooked up in a single generation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The priest has to provide a false sense that spirit realms are like our own socialized realm of acceptable and reliable behavior. That &amp;quot;over there&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s very much like over here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not like that in other realities!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each one is different, the rules change, your physical body changes, and it&amp;#39;s extremely difficult to learn to &amp;quot;hold one&amp;quot; steadily,  long enough to even learn the rules there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have a terrible time teaching sorcery because of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A simple technology, very easy to understand and which produces astonishing results if you practice it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s notoriously unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not because it&amp;#39;s  imaginary or &amp;quot;not true&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But because of our very nature to travel between tens of thousands of alternate versions of our current reality, including 600 actual alternate copies of our own self out there, into which we can transfer our consciousness and theoretically choose to live there permanently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know about that permanent part from my own experience, but you can certainly visit.  Even for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reality is VAST.  It&amp;#39;s not so much that there&amp;#39;s this one we have, and then there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;the spirit realm&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or &amp;quot;the heavenly realm&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We like to put limits on the madness and the crazy shaman leader of the tribe can&amp;#39;t keep telling a different story each week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People want to hear that the spirit realm is just as reliable as this realm, only hidden from their sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the shaman prophet is forced to lie about what he claims to be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if he sincerely becomes interested in exploring the truth of our endless choices for a reality to perceive, he can&amp;#39;t help control the people of a tribe by telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll decide he&amp;#39;s simply crazy, and not wise at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The shaman leaders, the prophets, and the priests, are all in the business of lying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no other for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you fall for their lies, you can&amp;#39;t proceed on the path of sorcery.  It&amp;#39;s an unresolvable contradiction of the truth of the situation we&amp;#39;re in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because reality is infinitely complex.  Not simple, and not at all like this world we were born into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, most of what humans can perceive cannot even be translated into words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s off in &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Understand this:  All religions are lies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can&amp;#39;t be anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, once you realize that the assemblage point can move and reality itself changes around you, you come to realize that &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; are just points in space.  With no value once you stray far from that location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the priest is in the business of lying about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here come the two biggest assaults on witches possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid, I myself am totally guilty of one in regards to Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s a powerful witch, but I&amp;#39;m involved in a battle to save sorcery from attack by religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so the symbols of those religions are odious to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I get a new follower on social media and see a Yin/Yang symbol in their user id, I know that person is likely going to attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t want to read that they&amp;#39;re delusional, and have been tricked by the lying priests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t matter what symbols. Even if it&amp;#39;s Jewish Qaballa or the grinning Buddha man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any symbol from the priests means the person displaying it has been taken in by lies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brainwashed. And will feel entitled to attack if their religious beliefs are not at least &amp;quot;respected&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not realizing, that kind of thinking prevents the possibility to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita of course is just building a smelly bubble bath with pink champagne and candles all around her.  Filling her environment with reminders that magic exists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With her religion&amp;#39;s decorations to hint at &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot;.  Or, &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s magic in the world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Symbols and decorations to remind her that it&amp;#39;s possible to explore realms outside our ordinary reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I want to instead saddle her with male reasoning saying, &amp;quot;That shit doesn&amp;#39;t work!  Don&amp;#39;t you know that&amp;#39;s unreliable and has no actual power at all, other than some tiny feel good sensations?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#39;s the tiny feel good sensations she seeks in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because those move her assemblage point, and other realities become visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the male leaders can&amp;#39;t have that sort of tolerant outlook, because their key to power is to control the beliefs of those around them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The big tribal chief with the largest muscles actually has no power at all, if his people won&amp;#39;t pick him up after battle and help him to heal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the real power rests with the priests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they don&amp;#39;t like to have their &amp;quot;story&amp;quot; doubted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t want to hear any questioning of their authority.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone might ask the priest,  &amp;quot;But the people off in the yellow lands, have never seen your God of the white sands.  How do you explain that they have a different all powerful guiding spirit?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re evil!&amp;quot;, he&amp;#39;ll reply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if he&amp;#39;s very artful and disguises that message as something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the only thing the priest can possibly say.  He has to dismiss objections as a place you aren&amp;#39;t supposed to look.  Because if you look away from where he needs you to look, then you have to be considered broken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Useless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A baby who stares off into space instead of smiling and doing tricks for the adults around it is a substandard quality baby.  A failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The priesthood creates the lie that the magical realms available to humans are just like this realm. Where the rules never change, and there is nothing beyond that new reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;top tribe&amp;quot;.  Nothing can ever be above it, or even just as good as it. It has to be exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to remain in power they have to create the idea that they have permanently figured out the highest truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There can&amp;#39;t be more for them to learn, or it adds some doubt to their authority.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The priest must instill the belief in the people that his attainment of supernatural visions is permanent, the ultimate, and that his word is completely reliable and reflects perfectly the higher truth of our existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact the &amp;quot;higher truth&amp;quot; of existence can never be reconciled with our current reality, because the multi-universe is not like that at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;religion&amp;quot; itself is a total assault on witches,  who can already perceive hints of the truth. The real truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reality is up for grabs!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A religion is an assault on women become it tells them that their very real magic and very real accomplishments in spiritual realms, driven by their need to sooth their troublesome biology, are invalid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evil even.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact the priests needed to come up with new laws, to handle women who won&amp;#39;t agree with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thou Shalt not Suffer a Witch To Live&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t go into the lame excuses Jewish Scholars come up with for that one.  The modern scholars realize that&amp;#39;s a souce of shame in their religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they play word games to make it seem as if it were never part of their &amp;quot;law&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Excuses which basically don&amp;#39;t hold up to their own religious narrative. Or even to their own religious history of witch burnings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which seems to be nearly universal all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even today witches are being burned.  Try Papua New Guinea for examples.   But it happens in small villages all over the world when some random misfortune is blamed on the village witch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does this all mean?  Why should someone interested in sorcery care?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because sorcery is not discovered in the realm of the reliable and repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That belief that it could be found there, is a male desire to dominate the tribe as the shaman priest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With lies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lies in particular, attack women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because women naturally explore the unknown.  And learn to use it, if given a chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s favorite decorations may be pure nonsense, but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter because they inspire her as much as the flowers and candles she loves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she can summon &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re part of an effort to make it easier to move her assemblage point, so as to influence the only actual force controlling the entire multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is no reliable chief tribal leader or priest like God, over all realms of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Virtually all are not even human.  Some don&amp;#39;t even have time or physical matter as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ve heard that even insects have some very lovely places to live.  And a path to freedom just as we&amp;#39;ve been granted by the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of that is available to humans for exploring, but only witches naturally do it without having to become a hermit living in the desert for 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The achievements and value of women has been delegated to a status of &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; or &amp;#39;&amp;quot;delusional&amp;quot; by the priests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the tribal leader is not sufficiently powerful enough to stop witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the priests are. They control the lynch mobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And oddly, their strongest attacks on witches go completely unnoticed in the world of religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even our most powerful religious &amp;quot;leaders&amp;quot; are absolutely clueless of the harm they do to witches with their big lies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How can it be that the  Dalai Lama, the Pope, and all historical leaders such as the Buddha, Lao Tsu  or Enoch, harm witches with their lies and are oblivious to it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we accept their claims as sacred and wise?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in fact their two most insidious lies strike at the very heart of our ability to explore magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We first take away the power of infants by teaching them where to look, and that spirits don&amp;#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the religious leaders seal the fate of witches by teaching that there&amp;#39;s a single higher reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that the authority to perceive such things is a permanent attainment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that if you don&amp;#39;t agree there&amp;#39;s only one higher truth you haven&amp;#39;t seen anything worth seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They teach that what&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot; is just like what&amp;#39;s here, and anyone who sees it differently is &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where to look, which beings are ok for friends, that any attempt to rise above our reality must find a new version that&amp;#39;s like this one, and that anyone who does such things successfully reaches that &amp;quot;high state&amp;quot; permanently, are the 4 main assaults on witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To berate their accomplishments so thoroughly that no one will listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that they drown away in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ought to try to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A woman in the bathtub can kick the Dalai Lama&amp;#39;s butt all day long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In every magical and spiritual way imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we want to undermine the priests and reduce male control, raise the witches up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived":

directly tied to how you feel about it, rather than to something mysterious and hard to comprehend.\n\nBUT, what we don't realize when we hear that and think that means it's not \"magical\", or \"energy related\", is that all there is in existence (that we know of) is the dark sea of emanations, and blobs of awareness given to living beings, to use for perceiving it.\n\nThus NOTHING is more magical or less magical than anything else.\n\nIt's all the same thing.\n\nThis becomes more clear as you do Tensegrity in silence, and it \"retrains\" how you use your muscles, in relation to how you perceive that.\n\nYou find that using your muscles to move around causes a \"flow\" of awareness.\n\nEspecially on the back!  There's something about arching or stretching the back even slightly, that sends out a sort of \"shield\" of awareness in a forward direction.  One that's visible eventually, as a pinkish dusty light.\n\nI suppose a good analogy would be that you fill a room with mild smoke, maybe that kind they use on rides at Disneyland.   Not harmful to breathe.\n\nThen illuminate that smoke with a dull pink light in a nearly perfectly dark room.\n\nImagine then, you have absolutely no words in your mind, which is a very pleasant relief once it's not hard to hold that state.\n\nAnd you smoothly walk along in your darkroom.  After doing a lot of tensegrity forms, to get a certain feeling of smoothness in your movements.\n\nWearing socks doesn't hurt.\n\nThe smoke swirls and moves around where your body parts passed through it.\n\nLike you were underwater.\n\nAnd because you're silent, anywhere you look that was disturbed has tiny visions or the faces of alien beings, or even whole scenes of foreign landscapes on the ripples of the smoke where it's been pushed to be more concentrated, and thus glow pink more.\n\nSo far my description is just visual.\n\nBut in silence, doing that you begin to feel that what's stirring the smoke is just you moving along.

One that&amp;#39;s visible eventually, as a pinkish dusty light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose a good analogy would be that you fill a room with mild smoke, maybe that kind they use on rides at Disneyland.   Not harmful to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then illuminate that smoke with a dull pink light in a nearly perfectly dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine then, you have absolutely no words in your mind, which is a very pleasant relief once it&amp;#39;s not hard to hold that state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you smoothly walk along in your darkroom.

Doubts and worries from this happening compounding on that, blaming myself for shit. Has gotten to a point where I'm just primarily sad, scared and incredibly fucked up all at once.

What you said to Cholitas bath practices I have been doing to myself about nearly anything at all that doesn't come from a killer intent to make this world right again. Any positive feeling, any \"meaningless\" \"trivial\" little connection, is quashed in favor of this obsession with power and a mind which knows exactly how to use it, when, how much, why, where, to who, on and on to fucking infinity. And it's not that I don't have positive emotion, but it like never builds. It's like something I keep on the shelf to want to stay alive rather than my primary concern.\n\nAnd at 22 I just find myself wanting to drink and play with my dogs, have friends, let all of this cool (what I have defined as heroic and out of reach) \"spiritual mission\" whatever stuff that I keep trying and failing to allow to grow through me, to do anything I want at all!!. To allow ANYTHING. I'm just not even free! My mind is stuck on these needs and fixations. It feels right to try and fix this outcome it's far too great of an outcome, but I have some kind of contradiction in me keeping me from doing it at all, anyway! I want so bad to just live in a society that isn't fucking weak and stupid. It drives me nuts. And I think it's because of my resentment and hatred at this, compounding towards myself from judging my OWN weaknesses, intent to quash it then hurting me, that I then bottle up cause I don't want to fail at this, etc etc etc\n\nI'm so sick and exhausted all the time trying to hide my true beliefs and intentions. I'm facing some God awful shit everyday. Last night I got stoned and performed a chiropractic adjustment on myself before ending up in the bathroom performing some kind of integration of my broken pieces, and promptly being attacked so horrendously thoroughly that I thought from moment to moment that I was the most horrible disgusting creature, that what I just did was an abject failure, that my life itself is, everyone hates me, I can't do anything at all, tensing up again undoing the yoga and massage I did on myself. Fucking hilarious and sad at the same time.\n\nI cant seem to build my experience, connection to self, willingness, positive emotion, to the point that I can do all of the things I want to do how I actually want to. Just numb and thoughtful and expressing my personality.\n\nI seem to really need recapitulation and personal power but at the same time facing my fear of being dejected and broken in front of others may be more useful, since I utterly crush and disdain those behaviors coming from me. I get so insecure and anxious that I like can't even let myself be seen. Maybe that's why I keep going back to being that way when I don't want to.\n\nI don't even know. I guess I'm just trying. I should be excited about all of this but the images of humanity and myself I got last night fucking terrified me. Dead faces with gaping mouths. Some beings doing this and making a mokery of us as they do it. Is it our own most spurned and hated aspects which directly undermine us or is it alien, like fliers???\n\nIf I could have the answer to this one question I would feel much better. I would know why I should be hostile and when, how and where. When unconditional love is the real remedy. But regardless of hostility and the intent to destroy something, capitulation and a density of desired experiences and emotion, presence and belief in the self, willingness, love, seems to be what scatters that influence, the most. And ironically that's where intent seems to want me to go rather than hostility and anger. But it's so cruel because that's my natural reaction to something so horrible that's hurting what I love. What a tricky fuckin bitch of a place this is.\n\nOnce enough people who are aware of what's going on begin to meaningfully apply ourselves together in the world as our daily lives, hiding less, giving more, having more personal power and connection, these systems are going to get terrified, people are going to wonder why they can't seem to live like we do, and shit might hit the fan. Or it might just be incredibly beautiful I don't even know. It probably is going to come down to how much people are willing to love themselves and accept what is true for them. Those that don't will smash against their own resistance towards it... but I don't even freaking know man.\n\nMaybe this doesn't even need to happen as a concentrated effort. Maybe the past few years of my life were mostly a waste lmao. It just seems crazy to me that with how broken and dejected everyone is, it could be possible that people just switch to living how they want and purifying their perception and intent. And start making free connections again all the time, It just seems like there's too much holding us down, but it is our natural desire to be healed and whole sooo.... daaayyyuuummm this place is crazy.

Fucking hilarious and sad at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cant seem to build my experience, connection to self, willingness, positive emotion, to the point that I can do all of the things I want to do how I actually want to. Just numb and thoughtful and expressing my personality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I seem to really need recapitulation and personal power but at the same time facing my fear of being dejected and broken in front of others may be more useful, since I utterly crush and disdain those behaviors coming from me. I get so insecure and anxious that I like can&amp;#39;t even let myself be seen. Maybe that&amp;#39;s why I keep going back to being that way when I don&amp;#39;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even know. I guess I&amp;#39;m just trying. I should be excited about all of this but the images of humanity and myself I got last night fucking terrified me. Dead faces with gaping mouths. Some beings doing this and making a mokery of us as they do it. Is it our own most spurned and hated aspects which directly undermine us or is it alien, like fliers???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I could have the answer to this one question I would feel much better. I would know why I should be hostile and when, how and where. When unconditional love is the real remedy. But regardless of hostility and the intent to destroy something, capitulation and a density of desired experiences and emotion, presence and belief in the self, willingness, love, seems to be what scatters that influence, the most. And ironically that&amp;#39;s where intent seems to want me to go rather than hostility and anger. But it&amp;#39;s so cruel because that&amp;#39;s my natural reaction to something so horrible that&amp;#39;s hurting what I love. What a tricky fuckin bitch of a place this is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once enough people who are aware of what&amp;#39;s going on begin to meaningfully apply ourselves together in the world as our daily lives, hiding less, giving more, having more personal power and connection, these systems are going to get terrified, people are going to wonder why they can&amp;#39;t seem to live like we do, and shit might hit the fan. Or it might just be incredibly beautiful I don&amp;#39;t even know. It probably is going to come down to how much people are willing to love themselves and accept what is true for them. Those that don&amp;#39;t will smash against their own resistance towards it... but I don&amp;#39;t even freaking know man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe this doesn&amp;#39;t even need to happen as a concentrated effort. Maybe the past few years of my life were mostly a waste lmao. It just seems crazy to me that with how broken and dejected everyone is, it could be possible that people just switch to living how they want and purifying their perception and intent. And start making free connections again all the time, It just seems like there&amp;#39;s too much holding us down, but it is our natural desire to be healed and whole sooo.... daaayyyuuummm this place is crazy. Or I am. Probably both.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10f4zgu/the_assault_on_women/j4wvhep/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1674074339.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_10f4zgu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_10f4zgu", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j4wgafi", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j4we7db", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "No, just the latest one, after the texts are \"burnt,\" when she's on another planet training with Princess Leia.\n\nAnd Luke is a force ghost...which can still catch a lightsaber (a physical object) BTW.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j4wgafi", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, just the latest one, after the texts are &amp;quot;burnt,&amp;quot;

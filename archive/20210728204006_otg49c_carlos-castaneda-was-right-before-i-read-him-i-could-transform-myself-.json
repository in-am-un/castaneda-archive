OP's title for this [user-deleted] post, and the content was as follows:\n\nI was born asthmatic, so the struggle to survive as a child rendered me unable to play like other kids, but I kept constantly and unknowingly shifting my assemblage point as a tiny brained kid would be able to do, it was subtle states of trance coupled with heavy breathing due to asthma and inner silence of being secluded in a dormitory hospital, fast forward when I was 15, I had become a champion athlete.\n\nIt was almost as if I was assembling my own body and consciously building it, as opposed to the other kids who weren't athletic, because they had natural bodies, with noo birth defects like myself.\n\nWhen I was 27, I was heavy on Cannabis for 3 days, did not have money and had noo food, and my gf had dumped me, I was in a state of heavy trauma and a hawk fell from the sky and it did something very interesting, as I was wailing, it also started to wail, when I opened my mouth, it also opened its mouth.\n\nIt was as if 99% of my inner soul had been manifested in the hawk and 1% was inside me and I am viewing myself from within myself into another reality, but the other reality was not unreal, the hawk was very much alive, i gave it water and after it had drunk, I re emerged from my state of trance and I walked away.\n\nSo, imagine I attempt the highest form of sorcery, like flight!!. Will I be able to fly? yes, If my energy body fully leaves and transmutes into a hawk and my consciousness becomes the hawk I can. But then all entities have some form of self importance, some for of ego, so my energy body might not fully leave me. Or even if it leaves, can I return back to my original body? do I have the mental discipline?. I could also fly If i conceptualize myself as having large wings and the perfect aerodynamics for flight, but can I conceptualize the pain it would require to grow those wings?, will my self importance allow that?.\n\nI have first hand of shifting assemblage points, so I know all the other practices by Carlos should be right and needs further exploring, which I haven't done. I'm particularly interested in gaining an inorganic ally who can help me out.\n\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20210728184033/https://old.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/otg49c/carlos_castaneda_was_right_before_i_read_him_i/", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kpp43f3", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carlos Castaneda Was Right: Before I read him, I could transform myself into an animal by shifting my assemblage point&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, is the OP&amp;#39;s title for this [user-deleted] post, and the content was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was born asthmatic, so the struggle to survive as a child rendered me unable to play like other kids, but I kept constantly and unknowingly shifting my assemblage point as a tiny brained kid would be able to do, it was subtle states of trance coupled with heavy breathing due to asthma and inner silence of being secluded in a dormitory hospital, fast forward when I was 15, I had become a champion athlete.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was almost as if I was assembling my own body and consciously building it, as opposed to the other kids who weren&amp;#39;t athletic, because they had natural bodies, with noo birth defects like myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was 27, I was heavy on Cannabis for 3 days, did not have money and had noo food, and my gf had dumped me, I was in a state of heavy trauma and a hawk fell from the sky and it did something very interesting, as I was wailing, it also started to wail, when I opened my mouth, it also opened its mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was as if 99% of my inner soul had been manifested in the hawk and 1% was inside me and I am viewing myself from within myself into another reality, but the other reality was not unreal, the hawk was very much alive, i gave it water and after it had drunk, I re emerged from my state of trance and I walked away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, imagine I attempt the highest form of sorcery, like flight!!.

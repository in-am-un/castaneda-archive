That route to don Juan's house.

It was Juan Bandera, she said, who, guided by the spirit itself, organized military units among the Yaquis. Often armed only with bows and arrows, Bandera's warriors fought the Mexican troops for nearly ten years. In 1832, Juan Bandera was defeated and executed.\n\nDelia said that the next leader of renown was Jose Maria Leyva, better known as Cajeme - the one who doesn't drink. He was a Yaqui from Hermosillo. He was educated, and had acquired vast military skills fighting in the Mexican army. Thanks to those skills, he unified all the Yaqui towns. From his first uprising in the 1870s, Cajeme kept his army in an active state of revolt. He was defeated by the Mexican army in 1887 in Buatachive; a fortified mountain stronghold. Although Cajeme managed to escape and hide in Guaymas, he was eventually betrayed and executed. The last of the great Yaqui heroes was Juan Maldonado, also known as Tetabiate rolling stone. He reorganized the remnants of the Yaqui forces in the Bacatete Mountains from which he waged ferocious and desperate guerrilla warfare against Mexican troops for more than ten years.\n\n\"By the turn of the century,\" Delia wrapped up her stories, \"the dictator Porfirio Diaz had inaugurated a campaign of Yaqui extermination. Indians were shot down as they worked in the fields. Thousands were rounded up and shipped to Yucatan to work in the henequen plantations, and to Oaxaca to work in the sugar cane fields.\"\n\nI was impressed by her knowledge, but I still couldn't figure out why she had told me all this.\n\nI said admiringly, \"You sound like a scholar; a historian in the Yaqui way of life. Who are you really?\"\n\nFor an instant she seemed to be taken aback by my question, which was purely rhetorical, then she quickly recovered and said, \"I've told you who I am.

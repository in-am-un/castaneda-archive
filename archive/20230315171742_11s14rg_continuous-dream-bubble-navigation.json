Nothing \"up your sleeve\".\n\nIn fact nothing like what we are perceiving, exists at all.\n\nPhysicists come close to explaining to us what's really going on, with their superstring theory.\n\nThat reality is a series of super strings vibrating.  That the vibrations are reliable, and the interactions in there consistent, gives rise to our belief in a physical reality, and physical matter.  But that's actually just a \"higher level\" illusion, and not the original cause.\n\nThat superstring theory bit the dust at least 20 years ago, and I believe now it's donuts.\n\nMuch better!\n\nSuper donuts.\n\nBut what physicists say doesn't matter. They're still stuck on the idea of solid particles.\n\nThe truth is that reality is created by \"the emanations\".\n\nAnd we don't mess around in sorcery!\n\nI get to see those nightly, for hours.\n\nAnd manipulate them, to watch reality change.\n\nIn ways that break the laws of physics from time to time.\n\nSo by \"suggesting\" their first inorganic being will have a particular look, you have left their latent awareness focused on some of those emanations, which create that appearance.\n\nDoesn't matter if that has anything at all to do with inorganic beings.\n\nIt'll still be there, a latent echo in the \"emanations\", and the resulting appearance will be influenced by that suggestion.\n\nBecause in fact, the inorganic beings are elsewhere. And their physical appearance is not something we can't comprehend as beginners.\n\nIt's too \"alien\".  Meaning, it doesn't even have physical matter as we know it. And both time and space are not the same in their world, as they are here.\n\nDreams are subject to the same influences. Being caused by the emanations also.\n\nSo if you watch \"Jaws\" from the 1970s, you might dream of killer fish that evening.\n\nIt doesn't at all mean, your dreams are totally imaginary and unusable as a substantial reality you can act in.   In fact, the guy who runs around in your dreams is simply \"lost\".\n\nAnd can be guided into this \"real\" world, where you can see him standing beside you!\n\nHe can even move objects here, although my opinion is that he's limited to a few ounces of pushing on stuff.\n\nCholita is. The inorganic beings are.\n\nThe influence of suggestions on stuff like this just means, a \"real\" reality contains trillions of those superstrings sorcerers get to perceive.\n\nAnd some of them are just \"icing on the cake\".\n\nThose are the ones that are up for grabs.\n\nAnd they're also the ones people living in the \"river of shit\" turn into grief, sadness, worry, hatred, and fear.\n\nWe \"inject\" something unreal into our view of reality, and our life goes to shit.\n\nWe barely notice that anymore, we got used to it so thoroughly.\n\nSo take Yoda's advice:\n\n \u201c**Fear is the path to the dark side**. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.\u201d \n\nHe's explaining how the \"optional emanations\" used to build our reality, can really mess things up.\n\nBut if you control that sort of thing, you end up with the force (the emanations and the flow of *intent* across them) as your ally.\n\nAs Yoda said, \n\n\"For my ally is the Force, and **a powerful ally it is**.

Put your mask on and do the movements for about an hour without stopping. No breaks. Slow motions, looking at any possible changes in the darkness and don&amp;#39;t stop even if you don&amp;#39;t see any changes. Would you stop working out even if you don&amp;#39;t see the immidiate result in the mirror?  To see your muscles growing you need at least several months of dedication. Sometimes even a year if you don&amp;#39;t kill your gains with bad habits ( like masturbation, which kills the gains in both :gym and dark room) Go into the dark room with the same attitude. And don&amp;#39;t cut your time, sit in the room even if nothing happens, just for the sake of bringing the inner dialogue down. After an hour of magical passes, rest a bit but get up immediately and do more if the inner dialogue gets activated. Don&amp;#39;t assume it will stop on it&amp;#39;s own. Do more of tensegrity. Slow, with full attention. You will find fun later and your awareness muscles will grow. I hope it helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10hlnxa/a_drop_in_the_bucket/j59yhak/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1674308581.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_10hlnxa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j5dhf2z", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "pinkerton904", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j595r1m", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_p5p3i8a0", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Learning Tensegrity takes some discipline but it's very worth it.

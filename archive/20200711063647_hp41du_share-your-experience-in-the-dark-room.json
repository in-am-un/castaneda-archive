Castaneda's legacy is in danger.\n\nAs he sadly told me just a short while before he died, \"***No one believes me.***\"\n\nThat's why I'm here.\n\nI had no idea what might happen if people enter waking dreaming before recapitulating.\n\nI figured, they just would have a harder time, and I'd have to encourage them more.\n\nNow it seems, moodiness is the result.\n\nI had none of that.\n\nBut I did a doozy of a recapitulation.  Obsessive, and over the top.\n\nSo about the moods during darkness gazing, and the hangover moods.\n\nThose are lateral shifts of the assemblage point.\n\nWhen you force silence, the assemblage point gets looser.\n\nBut if the silence is not perfect, the lingering words can move the assemblage point in a sideways direction.  That produces moods.\n\nTo the left, angels, spirituality, fabulous treasures.\n\nTo the right, anger, physical violence, sex.\n\nWait... How come sex isn't to the left???\n\nBummer.\n\nIt must be why the Taiwanese bosses' son, who's been going to the female dentist a lot lately, told me he just likes the idea that she can kill him at any moment.\n\nI replied, \"Uh.  What????\"\n\nHe said, \"Yea, she can jab me with a scalpel or drill into my head.  I'm totally at her mercy.\"\n\nSo, yea.\n\nShift right = sex I suppose. It might explain \"50 shades of grey\" being popular.\n\nYou'll be plagued by those mood shifts (if you are the wobbly assemblage point type), all the way down to the red line in my dreaming types J curve picture.  I'm putting it here again:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f](https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f)\n\nSee how the red line is all the way down to the assemblage point being on your lower back?\n\nBelow that, you will not be plagued with moods.\n\nThe mood then will be bliss.\n\nThere and above, I suppose some people can shift laterally, due to having a less fixed assemblage point.\n\nBut just fight it off!  The goal is below.\n\nAnd don't expect to \"do something cool\".  That'll make the practice much slower.\n\nYou'll soon get used to purple puffs of color, and be bored with it.\n\nYou forget, the purple is a lighthouse on a distant shore in the dark sea of awareness.\n\nYou're trying to navigate to there, not play with the ripples on the water, which are reflecting that light.\n\nAnd those moods come out in the worst possible way.\n\nI don't mean, you feel like punching someone, when you normally don't.\n\nThat would be easy to ignore.\n\nI mean, you start feeling like you are failing, or wasting your time.\n\nYou want to give up.\n\nJust watch the colors!\n\nDon't stop watching the colors, until you can scoop a large blob up on your hand, move it around right in front of your face, and it stays there.\n\nAt that point, you can look around.\n\nLook for fibers. Dark or light.\n\nLook for an overall glow on things.\n\nSee if you can actually see the bed, despite the room being blackened.\n\nIf you crawl on it, and you absolutely do see the surface, even if what you see isn't the right details for it, you've arrived!\n\nYou are seeing pure energy!\n\nYou could stand in the center of the room, and gaze north.  See what you see. Then turn and gaze south, and see what you see.\n\nJust see the glow!  Don't yet worry about details.\n\nImagine how cool it would be, if you could actually see why Carlos oriented his bed to face north?\n\nUsually that's just bad gossip in a guru world.  The master only sleeps facing north.\n\nYou hear it in any meditation group that has a master.\n\nAnd all you can think is, \"ooohhh.  How spooky. The guy must be so wise...\"\n\nNonsense.\n\nDemand to see why for yourself!\n\nAnd once at that point, look for other activities, all involving the light.\n\nLines, puffs, inorganic being faces, a general glow on all flat surfaces.\n\nYou're trying to finish off the process of luring your assemblage point to the desired destination.\n\nThe purple area at the far end of that J curve.\n\nBut anything in the orange area is pure magic.\n\nIf you keep looking and interacting, in pure silence, you'll get to the start of the purple.\n\nEvery breath will be like a soothing sigh.  No more expensive breathing lessons for you!\n\nNow sit up on the bed.\n\nLater you need to walk around while doing this, but that's too hard.  And scary too.\n\nIt's nice to have the bed between you, and beings which will now manifest in your room.\n\nSitting on the bed, and with the deep silence you will have attained to reach this point, find the images that drive the internal dialogue.\n\nIt's pictures in the mind.\n\nA scene.\n\nA clump of emanations.\n\nThere are great bands of emanations.\n\nThe cheese slices in that J curve image.  The J is oriented inside the human great band.\n\nBut there are bundles of emanations.\n\nThis reality is such a bundle.  But there are many others.\n\nAnd there are the emanations themselves.\n\nAs far as I can tell, we are a bubble on those.  \n\nBut there are also virtual worlds.  Dream worlds with the energy of just one person.\n\nI'll call those \"clumps\", until I forget to do so.\n\nClumps can be fun.\n\nBut they also suck.\n\nMemories form mini-clumps.\n\nYou're all clumpy inside!\n\nYuck.  \n\nThose aren't so hard to get rid of at this point.  You just need to know about them.\n\nUnfortunately, one clump leads to the next, if you haven't recapitulated.\n\nBut you're strong enough to fight that.\n\nStop the clumps.\n\nRid your mind of images of things that bother or excite or worry you.\n\nNothing should be left, but your ability to perceive. \n\nNo words, no images.\n\nMind blank.\n\nNow, sitting there in that manner, the room will be buzzing with magic.\n\nBut only the magic you allow.\n\nThere's the rub. \n\nYou have to cut that out!\n\nYou need to learn, that the universe is your friend.\n\nFor real.\n\nIt's not proof of friendship, if you keep making demands.\n\nEven if you get them!\n\nYou had to ask for your gifts.\n\nHow do you know you're really friends?\n\nStop asking for stuff.  Stop judging if you like what you got.\n\nFind Mr. DoubleTake.\n\nHe's the bastard making the demands.\n\nHe wants to see everything, and decide how he feels about it.\n\nIf he could stop magic, he'd do it.  \n\nBut by now, you've taken away most of his power to do that.\n\nExcept, he's tricky.\n\nAt first, he's like a little Hitler in your head,  forcing you to look where he likes, and not look where he doesn't like you to look.\n\nYou were afraid of him, and he was in full control.\n\nAll the purple puffs you've been playing with, have proven he isn't in charge anymore.\n\nHe couldn't stop them!\n\nBut he's still there, whispering in your ear.  \"I like that!\".  \"Oh, that's not enough.\"\n\n\"What's that over there???\"\n\nHe's a monkey on your back now.\n\nGet him off.\n\nUnlimited power comes from that.\n\nSilvio Manuel level power.\n\nYou won't know what to do with it, but it'll make suggestions.\n\nAll by itself!\n\nAnd now you know, the universe is in fact your friend. I'll make gifts without you having to ask.\n\nThere's a HUGE difference between a free gift, and having to demand them.\n\nIt might scare the shit out of you at this point, but by now you're used to that.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1594663286.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fxy6ndg", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced information about this technique.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, you really should recapitulate before doing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My bad...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m experimenting on all of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an emergency!

The J is oriented inside the human great band.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there are bundles of emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This reality is such a bundle.  But there are many others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there are the emanations themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, we are a bubble on those.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there are also virtual worlds.  Dream worlds with the energy of just one person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll call those &amp;quot;clumps&amp;quot;, until I forget to do so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clumps can be fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they also suck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Memories form mini-clumps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re all clumpy inside!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yuck.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those aren&amp;#39;t so hard to get rid of at this point.  You just need to know about them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, one clump leads to the next, if you haven&amp;#39;t recapitulated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;re strong enough to fight that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop the clumps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rid your mind of images of things that bother or excite or worry you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing should be left, but your ability to perceive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No words, no images.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mind blank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, sitting there in that manner, the room will be buzzing with magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But only the magic you allow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s the rub. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to cut that out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to learn, that the universe is your friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not proof of friendship, if you keep making demands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you get them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You had to ask for your gifts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you know you&amp;#39;re really friends?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop asking for stuff.  Stop judging if you like what you got.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find Mr. DoubleTake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s the bastard making the demands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wants to see everything, and decide how he feels about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he could stop magic, he&amp;#39;d do it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But by now, you&amp;#39;ve taken away most of his power to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, he&amp;#39;s tricky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, he&amp;#39;s like a little Hitler in your head,  forcing you to look where he likes, and not look where he doesn&amp;#39;t like you to look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You were afraid of him, and he was in full control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the purple puffs you&amp;#39;ve been playing with, have proven he isn&amp;#39;t in charge anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He couldn&amp;#39;t stop them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he&amp;#39;s still there, whispering in your ear.  &amp;quot;I like that!&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Oh, that&amp;#39;s not enough.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s that over there???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s a monkey on your back now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get him off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlimited power comes from that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silvio Manuel level power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t know what to do with it, but it&amp;#39;ll make suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All by itself!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now you know, the universe is in fact your friend. I&amp;#39;ll make gifts without you having to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a HUGE difference between a free gift, and having to demand them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might scare the shit out of you at this point, but by now you&amp;#39;re used to that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hp41du/share_your_experience_in_the_dark_room/fxy6ndg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1594661791.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_hp41du", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fxujr1h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fxugkxm", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I don't know.\n\nI'd like to follow her one day, but I don't have the ability yet.\n\nIf Fairy can find people, and I could follow her, that would be pretty cool.\n\nDon Juan could obviously do that with Carlos.\n\nMy best guess is, the inorganic beings have energy in their home, but they can project energy also, and so they have a double too.\n\nI'd have to be able to locate one in its home, at the same time its projection was near me.

If we have a question and want to find out some information, it\u2019s so that we can use it to change or improve something in our lives. We don\u2019t have a lot of use for just storing up stuff we might know and comparing it to other stuff we or others know and, idk, just having it in our heads. What\u2019s the point? Carlos used to talk to us in the woman\u2019s workshops about this. I remember him saying to let the men categorize and mess around with information. To just not concern ourselves with that. Mostly we don\u2019t, either, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s why male dominated forums, which is most of them, I think, have not so many women hanging around. The endless manipulation of concepts is pretty boring to us, no matter how lofty those subjects seem. I always feel slightly betrayed when I read a fairly interesting question and it\u2019s answered and/or addressed in some way and then I eagerly look to see where this has lead us and find it has lead nowhere. It was just an exercise in knowing some more stuff. \n\nI must say though, thank you big time to Dan. For fascinating, entertaining writing that has an actual, not to mention magical goal in mind as well as real experiences to communicate. This will draw the women. And definitely a sense of community will draw them. If they\u2019re like me, they love men so much, but just can\u2019t hang around with too much of the mental stuff. \nThe reason the women who are around communicate very little (except me; I have a strong masculine side), is that they\u2019re busy actually doing and can\u2019t see that talking about it would further anything. In my view, we\u2019re generally not really as good at doing and accomplishing things as men are, no doubt due to our absolute lack of focus, and that\u2019s one thing that makes men so fascinating. To us, they appear to be operating without a full deck. Something seems to be missing and I think it\u2019s that natural link to the Nagual. They have to fight for it where it comes naturally to us. Dan is of course right. It\u2019s because our A.P. is pretty wobbly, plus we naturally get info in an immediate way from the spirit. This is the inverted cone Florinda spoke about. As a result, we\u2019re not totally coherent in the tonal. Thank god men are around to help! And that\u2019s what we, or at least I, really admire about men. There they are, wandering around, unaware of part of reality, and yet......And yet, they accomplish wonders in this world. It\u2019s partially because they\u2019re masters of the tonal, but it takes more than that. It\u2019s no good without intent, and I suppose that\u2019s where their focusing ability comes in.

In rereading your advice here, I just remembered that yesterday ( I think it was yesterday) I was thinking to myself that there MUST be a less labor intensive way of dealing with the inner dialogue. I swear I was envisioning some place where it must all be generating from. One must be able to pull the plug somehow. Even temporarily, as you said. Wow! Somebody read somebody\u2019s mind! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, thanks for giving me a place to start. Maybe my basic laziness can have a use after all. I do remember that as a small child, largely ignored by my mother, I would often just sit and gaze at those little dust particles you could watch through the beam of sunlight coming through the window. Don\u2019t think there was much thought there as, as far as I knew, I didn\u2019t have a past or future. I was happy just sitting for hours. My mom never bothered me. It was only later when I had to go out and play with the neighbor kids and go to school, that I realized I was a hopeless loser since, although I could speak quite well, I didn\u2019t understand  the weird syntax of what seemed like a harsh, uncaring world to me. I resolved never to join forces with all that, and for the most part have not, not caring much that I remain a weirdo in many senses of the word. But yeah, still one does need to fit in to some degree to make one\u2019s way in the world. Don\u2019t remember seeing much weird stuff though except one time an IOB from a dream chased me through the house. Just the once and I told no one. But I do remember, even while he chased me, convincing myself it was all in my imagination. May have been a turning point. Silly kid!

You'll drift closer to the light house just by watching it, and it'll get brighter.\n\nAnd so here's the question everyone will ask: how long does that take?\n\nI don't know. 3 days for me.  But I'd been seeing colors with eyes close, for decades.\n\nI suppose it depends on how fixed the assemblage point is.\n\nAnd so, women will have an advantage. Due to their period, it never fully fixates.\n\nNot everyone is writing their experiences in here. \n\nSome want to keep them to themselves, as don Juan advised us.  And the dzogchen people always advise not to share.\n\nHowever, the Castaneda community is in crisis, so sharing seems reasonable to me.\n\nAnd the \"losing power\" thing seems to me to simply be noisy internal dialogue, stirred up by telling your experiences.\n\nSo force that off!  You have to anyway, and if it gets stirred up because you bumped up against a petty tyrant, so much the better.\n\nEven so, if people want to keep it to themselves, you might not have to fight off the internal dialogue as hard, some nights.\n\nAnd there's a talented woman or two in here, who don't share.\n\nTook them 1 or 2 nights to see cool stuff.\n\nNote: Cool stuff won't fully convince you.  You pretty much have to walk through your bedroom wall into another world, before you'll be satisfied.\n\n&gt; I do note tiny flashes of bright white\n\nI've always seen those in blue, but practicing gazing in darkness, I now see mostly white.  I've also seen red and yellow.  And a single green one.\n\nSomeone else practicing this technique right now sees white.\n\nIt's possible to increase the frequency of those, by pandiculating the right way.  See \"The Pandiculations of Zoltar\" for an explanation of that term.\n\n&gt;and my bedcovers would seem to be similar to these colors and moving in a chaotic, nauseating way. \n\nThat's the \"Readers of Infinity\" technique, except that as a child, you seem to have been good at lateral shifts.  That's the nausea.  But if you had calmly watched the noise you would have eventually assembled another world on the flat surface you were viewing.\n\nGazing at darkness should cause the assemblage to move downwards, along the same line as normal. I suppose that means, in the center of the thickness of the cheese slice, since when Carlos traced the path of the J curve, he only moved left or right 1 inch from the middle. And he kept his finger in the middle when he wasn't straying off.\n\nBut even gazing in darkness can end with a lateral shift, and I have noticed a \"nausea\" barrier, around 1/4th of the total distance of the J curve.\n\nIt's just before bliss.\n\n&gt; it\u2019s always a periwinkle blue and off to the side. \n\nIt's called, \"The Blue Pearl\" by yogis.  Muktananda and Yogananda people know about it. It's the last in the series of \"inner lights\", summoned by Patanjali's sutra.\n\n&gt; are those of our twin world the only ones we deal with?\n\nNope.  The Little Smoke is from the center of the universe.\n\nBut I suppose everyone here is paired off with a local IOB at birth.\n\nOr maybe most people.\n\nSo kids are almost born, with a monster in the closet.\n\n&gt;Or am I talking third attention here?\n\n3rd attention is automatically attained if you practice gazing at colors in darkness each day, and move your assemblage point to the end of the J curve (as evidenced by a new world assembling on your walls).\n\nFakers get obsessed with the \"bad ass\" sounding things from Carlos' books and make up their own additions, to impress others.\n\nIf you hear anyone say they know what the 3rd attention is, run.\n\nWho knows how mentally ill they really are.  They could be dangerous.\n\nThe third attention is automatic.  Put it out of your mind.\n\nThe old sorcerers didn't discover it, because they used rituals to move the assemblage point.\n\nLike all the stuff in Carlos' earlier books.  Old sorcerers stuff.\n\nBut we want to learn to move it manually, with no outside help. Just our gaze.\n\nSince you're a woman, I hope you find a male inorganic being!  They do exist.\n\nBut Cholita has convinced Minx to be male most of the time. He calls himself, \"baybay\".\n\nProbably our lineage only has female ones, because those like men, and men seem more likely to experiment with dangerous things.\n\nIn don Juan's party, there's no mention of any of the women having allies.\n\nBut at least 3 of the men did.  At least 7 total.\n\nBy the way, I have to mention that lately we are getting more women who seem inclined to practice.\n\nI wonder if we didn't go from male dominated inventory expert discussions, based around inspirational quotes, to an actually community here, which has the promise of a better future.\n\nAnd as a result, we'll get more women?\n\nWatching Carlos with his women,  and having Cholita around, and from what the witches said, especially Carol, that might be the general way things go.\n\nThe women like to join a lifestyle, more than they want secret powers so they can dominate other people.\n\nI sure hope so.

But I&amp;#39;d been seeing colors with eyes close, for decades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it depends on how fixed the assemblage point is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so, women will have an advantage. Due to their period, it never fully fixates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is writing their experiences in here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some want to keep them to themselves, as don Juan advised us.  And the dzogchen people always advise not to share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the Castaneda community is in crisis, so sharing seems reasonable to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;quot;losing power&amp;quot; thing seems to me to simply be noisy internal dialogue, stirred up by telling your experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So force that off!  You have to anyway, and if it gets stirred up because you bumped up against a petty tyrant, so much the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even so, if people want to keep it to themselves, you might not have to fight off the internal dialogue as hard, some nights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s a talented woman or two in here, who don&amp;#39;t share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Took them 1 or 2 nights to see cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: Cool stuff won&amp;#39;t fully convince you.  You pretty much have to walk through your bedroom wall into another world, before you&amp;#39;ll be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I do note tiny flashes of bright white&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always seen those in blue, but practicing gazing in darkness, I now see mostly white.  I&amp;#39;ve also seen red and yellow.  And a single green one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone else practicing this technique right now sees white.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible to increase the frequency of those, by pandiculating the right way.  See &amp;quot;The Pandiculations of Zoltar&amp;quot; for an explanation of that term.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and my bedcovers would seem to be similar to these colors and moving in a chaotic, nauseating way. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;Readers of Infinity&amp;quot; technique, except that as a child, you seem to have been good at lateral shifts.  That&amp;#39;s the nausea.  But if you had calmly watched the noise you would have eventually assembled another world on the flat surface you were viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gazing at darkness should cause the assemblage to move downwards, along the same line as normal. I suppose that means, in the center of the thickness of the cheese slice, since when Carlos traced the path of the J curve, he only moved left or right 1 inch from the middle. And he kept his finger in the middle when he wasn&amp;#39;t straying off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even gazing in darkness can end with a lateral shift, and I have noticed a &amp;quot;nausea&amp;quot; barrier, around 1/4th of the total distance of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just before bliss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;it\u2019s always a periwinkle blue and off to the side. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s called, &amp;quot;The Blue Pearl&amp;quot; by yogis.  Muktananda and Yogananda people know about it. It&amp;#39;s the last in the series of &amp;quot;inner lights&amp;quot;, summoned by Patanjali&amp;#39;s sutra.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;are those of our twin world the only ones we deal with?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope.  The Little Smoke is from the center of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I suppose everyone here is paired off with a local IOB at birth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe most people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So kids are almost born, with a monster in the closet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or am I talking third attention here?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3rd attention is automatically attained if you practice gazing at colors in darkness each day, and move your assemblage point to the end of the J curve (as evidenced by a new world assembling on your walls).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fakers get obsessed with the &amp;quot;bad ass&amp;quot; sounding things from Carlos&amp;#39; books and make up their own additions, to impress others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you hear anyone say they know what the 3rd attention is, run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who knows how mentally ill they really are.  They could be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The third attention is automatic.  Put it out of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old sorcerers didn&amp;#39;t discover it, because they used rituals to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like all the stuff in Carlos&amp;#39; earlier books.  Old sorcerers stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we want to learn to move it manually, with no outside help. Just our gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since you&amp;#39;re a woman, I hope you find a male inorganic being!  They do exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Cholita has convinced Minx to be male most of the time. He calls himself, &amp;quot;baybay&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably our lineage only has female ones, because those like men, and men seem more likely to experiment with dangerous things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In don Juan&amp;#39;s party, there&amp;#39;s no mention of any of the women having allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at least 3 of the men did.  At least 7 total.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, I have to mention that lately we are getting more women who seem inclined to practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder if we didn&amp;#39;t go from male dominated inventory expert discussions, based around inspirational quotes, to an actually community here, which has the promise of a better future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as a result, we&amp;#39;ll get more women?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching Carlos with his women,  and having Cholita around, and from what the witches said, especially Carol, that might be the general way things go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women like to join a lifestyle, more than they want secret powers so they can dominate other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sure hope so.

Been reading the reddit on the Dark Room practice for a while now and been attempting to see the colors in the dark with not much of results.  I used a welders mask to be able to get full darkness while keeping my eyes open. If sort of helped with the meditation part but still no colors.\n\nThen yesterday as I was meditating during the day I got a idea. What do you think, is this the way to go?\n\nI've been meditating for decades, so I usually do not close the eyes. That time it was daytime with shades down, so quite bright just not direct light. When I was a kid I used to play with my vision by stopping the gaze and unfocusing the attention. The result was that the vision of the world was disappearing in a whitish grayish fog. As kid I did this as it was entertaining at least for me. Later as I got older I started seeing waves in that fog and after I got some QiuGong \"education\" I started seeing a swirl of red and black \"spots\" going in a circular dance exactly like the Ying-Yang diagram. This got so normal and usual to me so I kind of stopped paying attention to this. Until yesterday when I was doing some guided meditation trying to follow some Buddhist visualization practices (Blue Buddha).\n\nVery usual beginning: cross legged pose with erect body; focus on breath; settle down the mind (this is very literal instruction, to move the energy from head to throat and then down to the heart). As result your mind calms down and my typical fog appears. When I was studying QuiGoing standing like a post (aka Horseman stance), I learned to notice that after you see the fog, you can see something crawling on the ground. Like a foggy spot that moves on it's own independently of the eye movemnt. This time I was sitting but saw the same spot just next to my legs.\n\nFrom that moment I didn't listen to the instructions in the headphones. I started to improvise. I focused on my lower Dantian and started breathing that spot in, and on exhale retaining the energy. The spot felt warm and dissolved in a few breathing cycles. I stopped breathing and went silent again, so the waves I mentioned before appeared again. Started breathing these in to my Dantian while retaining the energy on exhale. The waves dissolved too and what was there was just unusually even and calm grayish fog. There were couple more cycles one of them was a series of semaphore-like \"flashes\" from the left and right. Breathed these in too. Gray calmness. Silence.\n\nAfter awhile a bit darker spot showed up in the center of my view. I started watching it when suddenly I got \"thinking\", \"Man, it's pulsating with a very very light purple-blue and warm moon like yellow! What if I massage it with my hand?\" Again, it's day time with in shadow level light on a sunny day.\n\nI started doing that \"harp playing\" movement on the spot with my right hand. Bum, it's purple now! Kept doing it and the whole floor went purple... I'm experienced enough to not get excited but made a few descriptive thoughts so I can remember this later. Got back to silence and as the spot started to rotate I followed the rotation with my hands (one at a time) making it brighter. Eventually the light dissolved. Though the spot stayed.\n\nLater in the day I repeated the same procedure as above, while in twilight. I had vision of dim \"fake light\" to the right of me, so I breathed that in too. :) When the spot showed up again in the calm fog, this time after some short time of harping it, I started to scoop it towards my lower Dantian. All the floor got purple. And as I was scooping some areas were getting colorless, so I scoped the areas with colors.\n\nWhile my palm was going to the torso I saw something like a strip of light on the palm. After it happened for 3 times in the row, just to be sure that is not some light from a closet with doors closed but with the lights on that I was sitting next to, I used normal way of looking and looked at the palm while doing the same movement. There was no accidental light falling on to it. Though even with my \"fog seeing yes\" I didn't see the flashed anymore. Just to see the effect I used my left hand now and first followed the swirl direction (it's counterclockwise always) and then started scooping it again towards my torso. Bum! It's red now! The spot wasn't orange red like Zuleika's preference but slightly yellower than normal red. I kept scooping it until it dissolved again.\n\nWhen the spot showed up again, I did something else. I tried to harp it again while doing light fanning movements by the palm so the spot while there would move closer to my body. This time... I felt something moving inside of my Dantien. Exactly like it was described in the books, so this time I got excited and all of it went away. The feeling was like if you we touching some nerve with your hand, sharp and quick.\n\nI went silent and starred and scooped the lights for a bit more and ended the session. I have a problem with my limbs getting so sleepy that I have to massage my legs before harm could be done (I'm getting a Zen pillow or a bench for that). The whole second session lasted about 40 mins. And while I did the massage I realized that I got tired and hot while that session. That is not usual, I had to lay down to relax.\n\nDoes this look like what all of you are doing here with the Dark Room practice? Is it the same practice if done not in daylight or twilight? For some reason the total darkness or a mask gave me no results.\n\nThank you all for inspirations, special thanks to Dan!\n\nEDIT: I didn't remember the final part actually. Even though I do describe what is going on to help with remembering it took me until I got to bed and started my usual routine of staring in to the 3D void in front of my eyes.\n\nThe final part: as you noticed each time the colors dissolved I was experiencing more and more calm vision of the fog. That last time the was a orange-red blob/bindu in the center. I focued on it and tried to \"enter\" it or pull it closer. It got bigger and in it's lower right quadrant some more intense patch of red color appeared. It resembled a Y with two prongs on the left and almost forming a vertical line with the third one on the right.\n\nI kept staring at this. Suddenly the patch changed in to a vertical slit of darkness on the stell red background. It was still not in the center but in the lower right quadrant. I still tried to enter the blob or pull it closer. After some time all surroundings got red and the slit disappeared. I knew that it didn't work this time, so I ended the session.

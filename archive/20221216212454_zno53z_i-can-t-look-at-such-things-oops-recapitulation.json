With Carlos waiting at the gates of heaven, like Saint Peter.\n\nAnd no magic will come out of the practice. But it\u2019s quite simply \u201cgood for your soul\u201d.\n\nClearly that\u2019s not right if you read this. And it seems from what I read (not all out of a sense of guilt at having been told not to), that recap is just an alternate path to darkroom results.\n\nTo the mastery of moving the assemblage point!\n\nI felt a little surge of \"book deal pride\" when I read that he considers the assemblage point:\n\n\"One of the most elusive subjects of sorcery\".\n\nNot in the subreddit it isn't!!!\n\nMaybe because, we have inorganic being assistance?\n\n\\*\\*\\* From The \"Magical Passes\" Book \\*\\*\\*\n\nOne of the most important findings of the shamans of don Juan\u2019s lineage was that, like everything else in the universe, our world is a combination of two opposing, and at the same time complementary, forces.\n\nOne of those forces is the world we know, which those sorcerers called the world of organic beings. The other force is something they called the world of inorganic beings.\n\n\u201cThe world of inorganic beings,\u201d don Juan said, \u201cis populated by beings that possess awareness, but not an organism. They are conglomerates of energy fields, just like we are. To the eye of a seer, instead of being luminous, as human beings are, they are rather opaque. They are not round, but long, candlelike energetic configurations. They are, in essence, conglomerates of energy fields which have cohesion and boundaries just like we do. They are held together by the same agglutinating force that holds our energy fields together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is this inorganic world, don Juan?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIt is our twin world,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt occupies the same time and space as our world, but the type of awareness of our world is so different from the type of awareness of the inorganic world that we never notice the presence of inorganic beings, although they do notice ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre those inorganic beings human beings that have evolved?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNot at all!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cThe inorganic beings of our twin world have been intrinsically inorganic from the start, the same way that we have always been intrinsically organic beings, also from the start. They are beings whose consciousness can evolve just like ours, and it doubtlessly does, but I have no firsthand knowledge of how this happens. What I do know, however, is that a human being whose awareness has evolved is a bright, luminescent, round inorganic being of a special kind.\u201d\n\nDon Juan gave me a series of descriptions of this evolutionary process, which I always took to be poetic metaphors. I singled out the one that pleased me the most, which was total freedom. I fancied a human being that enters into total freedom to be the most courageous, the most imaginative being possible. Don Juan said that I was not fancying anything at all\u2014that to enter into total freedom, a human being must call on his or her sublime side, which, he said, human beings have, but which it never occurs to them to use.\n\nDon Juan described the second, the pragmatic goal of the recapitulation as the acquisition of fluidity. The sorcerers\u2019 rationale behind this had to do with one of the most elusive subjects of sorcery: the assemblage point, a point of intense luminosity the size of a tennis ball, perceivable when sorcerers see a human being as a conglomerate of energy fields.\n\nSorcerers like don Juan see that trillions of energy fields in the form of filaments of light from the universe at large converge on the assemblage point and go through it. This confluence of filaments gives the assemblage point its brilliancy. The assemblage point makes it possible for a human being to perceive those trillions of energy filaments by turning them into sensorial data.\n\nThe assemblage point then interprets this data as the world of everyday life, that is to say, in terms of human socialization and human potential.\n\nTo recapitulate is to relive every, or nearly every, experience that we have had, and in doing so to displace the assemblage point, ever so slightly or a great deal, propelling it by the force of memory to adopt the position that it had when the event being recapitulated took place. This act of going back and forth from previous positions to the current one gives the shaman practitioners the necessary fluidity to withstand extraordinary odds in their journeys into infinity. To the Tensegrity practitioners, the recapitulation gives the necessary fluidity to withstand odds which are not in any way part of their habitual cognition.\n\nThe recapitulation as a formal procedure was done in ancient times by recollecting every person the practitioners knew and every experience in which they had taken part. Don Juan suggested that in my case, which is the case of modern man, I make a written list of all the persons that I had met in my life, as a mnemonic device. Once I had written that list, he proceeded to tell me how to use it. I had to take the first person on the list, which went backwards in time from the present to the time of my very first life experience, and set up, in my memory, my last interaction with that first person on my list. This act is called arranging the event to be recapitulated.\n\nA detailed recollection of minutiae is required as the proper means to hone one\u2019s capacity to remember. This recollection entails getting all the pertinent physical details, such as the surroundings where the event being recollected took place. Once the event is arranged, one should enter into the locale itself, as if actually going into it, paying special attention to any relevant physical configurations. If, for instance, the interaction took place in an office, what should be remembered is the floor, the doors, the walls, the pictures, the windows, the desks, the objects on the desks, everything that could have been observed in a glance and then forgotten.\n\nThe recapitulation as a formal procedure must begin by the recounting of events that have just taken place. In this fashion, the primacy of the experience takes precedence. Something that has just happened is something that one can remember with great accuracy. Sorcerers always  count on the fact that human beings are capable of storing detailed information that they are not aware of, and that that detail is what the  dark sea of awareness is after.\n\nThe actual recapitulation of the event requires that one breathe deeply, fanning the head, so to speak, very slowly and gently from sideto side, beginning on one side, left or right, whichever. This fanning of the head was done as many times as needed, while remembering all the details accessible. Don Juan said that sorcerers talked about this act as breathing in all of one\u2019s own feelings spent in the event being recollected, and expelling all the unwanted moods and extraneous feelings that were left with us.\n\nSorcerers believe that the mystery of the recapitulation lies in the act of inhaling and exhaling. Since breathing is a life-sustaining function, sorcerers are certain that by means of it, one can also deliver to the dark sea of awareness the facsimile of one\u2019s life experiences. When I pressed don Juan for a rational explanation of this idea, his position was that things like the recapitulation could only be experienced, not explained. He said that in the act of doing, one can find liberation, and that to explain it was to dissipate our energy in fruitless efforts. His invitation was congruous with everything related to his knowledge: the invitation to take action.\n\nThe list of names is used in the recapitulation as a mnemonic device that propels memory into an inconceivable journey. Sorcerers\u2019 position in this respect is that remembering events that have just taken place prepares the ground for remembering events more distant in time with the same clarity and immediacy. To recollect experiences in this way is to relive them, and to draw from this recollection an extraordinary impetus that is capable of stirring energy dispersed from our centers of vitality, and returning it to them. Sorcerers refer to this redeployment of energy that the recapitulation causes as gaining fluidity after giving the dark sea of awareness what it is looking for.\n\nOn a more mundane level, the recapitulation gives practitioners the capacity to examine the repetition in their lives. Recapitulating can convince them, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that all of us are at the mercy of forces which ultimately make no sense, although at first sight they seem perfectly reasonable; such as being at the mercy of courtship.\n\nIt seems that for some people, courtship is the pursuit of a lifetime. I have personally heard from people of advanced age that the only ideal  that they had was to find a perfect companion, and that their aspiration was to have perhaps one year of happiness in love.\n\nDon Juan Matus used to say to me, over my vehement protests, that the problem was that nobody really wanted to love anybody, but that every one of us wanted to be loved. He said that this obsession with courtship, taken at face value, was the most natural thing in the world to us. To hear a seventy-five-year-old man or woman say that they are still in search of a perfect companion is an affirmation of something idealistic,  romantic, beautiful. However, to examine this obsession in the context of the endless repetitions of a lifetime makes it appear as it really is: something grotesque.\n\nDon Juan assured me that if any behavioral change is going to be accomplished, it has to be done through the recapitulation, since it is the only vehicle that can enhance awareness by liberating one from the unvoiced demands of socialization, which are so automatic, so taken for granted, that they are not even noticed under normal conditions, much less examined.

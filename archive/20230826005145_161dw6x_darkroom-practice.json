I do Darkroom, and that is where I started when I discovered this site. I can only talk of my own experiences because what may work for one may not work for another. I do everything sober, wide-awake, and eyes open.\n\nLearning sorcery is impossible as far as me telling you some 'technique' to quiet your Internal Dialogue, or some way of looking at the puffs. \n\nThink of when you were a child. There are no rules. You can try anything to find what works for you personally.\n\nTo get started: you should learn a few simple tensegrity moves like Zuileca's Pass, Life Saving Pass, parts of Running Man, or parts of The First Series for Preparing Intent. \n\nAs long as you can do one or two movements to keep from falling asleep, you can get started. Don't use learning some complex tensegrity as an excuse to put off getting started. \n\nOnce you know a tensegrity move or two, go into the Darkroom and stop that Internal Dialogue. That means no thoughts, no music, no images, no descriptions, no going, \"wow! What did I just see??\" Because all of that pulls you right back to the Blue Line and starts up your Internal Dialogue. \n\nYou will KNOW you became Silent because you will literally see a moving purple puff! That is your proof of Silence.\n\nNow if you go, \"Wow!\" when you see one, and it WILL happen, just patiently start again. At first, you are just looking for purple puffs. \n\nYou do some tensegrity movements, you stop and gaze, you change positions, you play around, and you do it all again. Don't turn it into a timed exercise, but remember, you are trying to follow the Intent of the long lineage of sorcerers who have been practicing down the ages. They didn't use timers, trust me. Just get into the Dark and play like when you were a child!!!\n\nAt first, you are looking for singular purple puffs because they are part of your energetic body... they move away because they are repulsed by your self-pity, but have come out to see why you are doing tensegrity in the dark. They are curious! They are sentient, and they are part of you!!\n\nOne will come and go, then another! Look on the map! It says as much! Now treat them as real! Try to manipulate them with your hands. Try eating them! The more you treat them as real the brighter they become! They can be felt! And they are in much more important than an IOB at first.\n\nWhat you are looking for in the dark. Is made clear in the J-curve map. That map is your chart for how far you are progressing because most everyone who has gone into the dark and achieved silence of their Internal Dialogue will see many of these very same things. It's a like a test to confirm if you are hooking into the right Intent. Step by step, Station by Station. There is a big difference between the Blue Zone and the Green, and an even more amazing difference between the Green Zone and the Red.\n\nYou cannot say you made it to the Red Zone without going through the Green Zone. And you can't say you made it to the Green zone without seeing the puffs!!!\n\nIf you are talking to IOB's your first weeks or even before you have put an hour into the Darkroom practice, without moving along the J-curve diagram, you are pretending or fantasizing. \n\nIf the scenes in the Darkroom are like dreams... complex, you may have drifted off to sleep, and none of what you see matters at all to Darkroom practice. \n\nSo let's not get ahead of ourselves with stories of poodles or crows and stick to what you are doing awake, sober, and with your eyes open in the Darkroom.\n\nFollow the map of the J curve stations which tells you exactly what you should be able to see each step. Some go faster than others, but no one skips the basics, not even women.\n\nThe Darkroom Technique was given to us by Little Smoke, Carlos's IOB and verified by not only Dan, but by other hard-working men and women on this site that are trying so hard to convince you that sorcery is possible not pretend. \n\nThe J Curve map is the product of all of these people verifying these steps. It is like a BS meter. If you aren't following the steps, you can tell. It is actually scientific. And believe me, you will be so amazed when the first real magic puff appears that you will go \"wow!\" And end up right back at the Blue Line. \n\nYou have to train yourself not to react so you can keep stringing longer and longer strands of Silence together. First a few seconds, maybe a minute. All training like lifting weights.\n\nOf course, there is much more to see than just the purple puffs. This is for the absolute beginner starting at the Blue Line.\n\nFollow the Directions!! This is Technology!! Not a religion or believe system of New Agey feel-good kumbaya. You HAVE to follow the steps... especially the men, but even the women. I hope this makes things clear for the starting sorcerers.

If you are male the process will, generally (Unless you have a female with a lot of energy around, then it\u2019s a bit faster.), be very slow and it will take a lot of work and time. If you are a female you can do this in a week or three. \n\nThe whole point of these techniques is to get the internal dialogue (ID from now on) to be quiet. Getting the ID to be quiet is the starting point for everything, the [Gateway to Infinity](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gateway-to-infinity_b_8066966) (for those of you who just *need* a distraction - I just knew someone had written something with that title!).\n\nThe basic ways of doing that are by increasing your sensory input, overloading the part of the brain that the ID uses for processing, by the pretzel technique or by combining them. If you have others please feel free to share. If you know all of these consider this a refresher. \n\nThe Pretzel Technique\n\nAt first, this appears to be the easy one: You get into the lotus position and you stay still until you become or force yourself to turn off your ID. This is only easy from a cultural perspective, obviously. We've come to accept the pretzel technique and associate it with Yogis and all kinds of wise men/people (for those of us who like Tilda Swinton) so it makes sense we would go for it. \n\nThe way of the pretzel technique are few: You sit (however you want really, it doesn't have to be a lotus position at all) and close your eyes. Having a sleep mask or some such that allows total/near total darkness (some sleep masks let you do this with your eyes open which is better. After buying a few the one that works for me is the [Manta Sleep Mask / Eye Mask / Best Sleeping Mask - 100% Blackout](https://mantasleep.com/products/manta-sleep-mask)) is helpful but not necessary at first. Make the ID be quiet. You can force it, sometimes, by moving your consciousness such that it's quiet. You move your consciousness (your Assemblage Point) by remembering how it felt the last time it was quiet.  This works the same way a really bad or annoying memory will make your heart go faster. Or a really good memory will slow it down. Your thoughts affect your body and your consciousness. I\u2019m pretty sure there have been studies that show this.\n\nA prerequisite to forcing the ID to be silent, for me, is having been quiet previously. I generally let it rant. Give it time and it will give you moments of silence; half a second here, a second there. After enough hours (say 100 hours) of practice you will notice these moments of silence and the ID will flare up immediately, \u201cI\u2019m being silent! Haaaaaaa!\u201d  Once you notice it enough times you will have an idea as to how you feel when your ID is silent and it will become possible for you, by remembering that feeling, to force your ID to be silent. Simple? Look at the 100 hours in parenthesis. If you take a break you will forget. It becomes easier with a lot of practice. The memory of silence is fleeting. \n\nForgetting is your enemy here.  If you can only practice one hour a day a good trigger would be counting down once you sit. Once you reach zero you will remember to trigger the memory. With practice this will cause your ID to stop going crazy. It helps if you relax.  You have to hold the feeling for a minute or two and you might get a second or three of silence. If you can force silence a few times a week, practicing every day (hours a day), in a few months you might get to two or three or four seconds at a time. Then you\u2019ll be doing better than me. \n\nThe ID is a part of you. It knows you. It will be very easy for you to come up with a good reason to skip practice one day, then two.   Before you know it you will go a week or two, a month or three without practice. Then you will have to begin over again. After months (or years) of starting and stopping you will have a good idea of the feeling. (Waaaait - I just got an opportunity to practice Silence! I\u2019ll be back.)\n\nI've had fleeting success (I would be surprised if I have been able to become quiet for more than a few seconds at a time, one or two - three seconds at the most.) with it though and am persistent as it requires the least amount of space and preparation - I just find a sofa or bed corner or the floor. Finally, while I consider myself a failure with it, I have done it so much over the years that I am comfortable with it so I default to it 99% of the time - to the point of just forgetting to do the other techniques. \n\nOh, and, of course non-ID related things have happened so it's not a total failure: I've been able to get into dreaming from it, grab an IB (Inorganic Being) that kept showing up looking exactly like me  \u2013 like a 3D hologram mirror (the electric shock was mild so disappointing - I expected it to shake my bones and tingle my brain, it didn't.) My \"Third Eye\" opens once in a while. That\u2019s interesting. I discovered I could direct where I looked (so, not the Third Eye in the way some people think). But, to me, it seemed more of a very aware dream where I could control what I was looking at \u2013 an exact copy of the room I was in -   rather than just seeing the apartment through what appeared to be the center of my forehead while my eyes were closed. Both the first and second times this happened I had not been practicing silence at all - more on that later as it may be a good way of getting the same thing. And there are the other known effects of \"meditating\": lower heart rate, increased focus/IQ (Yes, I measured many, many times \u2013 with a test that changed every time so each test was different.), better memory the calm, contented feeling Buddhist Monks carry around most times. And there is the normal high you get if you practice enough. That was one of the first things I noticed. Lately I\u2019ve experienced a ton of energy and faster reading.  And seeing energy, even with my eyes closed: so far only purple.  \n\nSensory Overload\n\nAnything that will do that will overwhelm your processing capacity and the ID will shut down. This is actually the best way to be silent as it doesn\u2019t have that \u201cI\u2019m being QUIET!!!\u201d thought which kicks you out of it after half a second or so. Since this is not something we find \u201cnormal\u201d we just forget to do it. So that\u2019s the difficulty of it. \n\nThere are many ways of getting this one done. If you are walking you normally look at whatever\u2019s directly in front of you and that\u2019s it. Unless we see unexpected movement we pretty much don\u2019t bother with the rest. In this particular case you want to take in/be aware of as much information as you can until the ID shuts down. It\u2019s a bit different because most people think their ID only becomes active when they close their eyes. If you get it to be silent while walking/having your eyes open you will see the difference. \n\nStep by step: you notice the people in front of you. You notice those closest to you and then the details you need to get past them. In this case you will take in every detail of as many people/obects/threes/animals as you can, notice things in your peripheral vision, adding one at a time until you make the ID silent while you walk. This is not so difficult. You are only able to keep track of a certain amount of things at one time. Once you reach that point the brain has to use any useless processing power (ID) to keeping the visual tracking going. I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing it while driving as I\u2019ve never tried it and don\u2019t know what happens. There are absolutely no problems while walking.  \n\nHave you noticed that we, sometimes, don\u2019t pay attention to the background sounds while walking? Once you decide they are \u201cnormal\u201d they are not important and can be tuned out. Tune them in. Actively listen and see if you can distinguish as much of it as you can. Along with looking at everything this adds to the processing load. But they can be done independently, this works particularly well in the NYC subway. The first time I was silent for a few seconds happened there. And it works indoors where you are walking in hallways even when there is very little noise.  \n\nA different way of doing it, the Power Walk: Look at where you will step next and make sure your feet land there. It\u2019s easier when walking on stones or bricks. Or if you are walking behind someone you know. Notice where they stepped and try to step exactly where they did.  This works pretty well in beach sand. Wasn\u2019t this one in a CC book? \n\nCombining sensory overload with the Pretzel Technique \n\nWhile sitting and practicing silencing the ID and it\u2019s talking nonsense at you visualizing will overload the ID\u2019s resources. It\u2019s not complete silence but it\u2019s a good beginning when you are deciding what to visualize. I don\u2019t mean replay a memory that way leads the ID to manipulate it and trouble ensues. Visualizing something simple, like a tennis ball, will do. Then, like walking, you load up some more, a pineapple and a tennis ball rotating around each other and so on. How many can you juggle before the ID can\u2019t talk? I can do three, sometimes four. You can also load multiple senses. See a pineapple (orange, apple, banana, screwdriver, car), in 3D of course, rotate it so you can see everything about it and add the smell of it. Add a soundtrack ([(245) 2001: A Space Odyssey Theme song - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwxYiVXYyVs))\n\nVisualize Pineapple, smell the pineapple or the oil from the car or the apple. Multiple sensory overload will get you quiet enough for you to go from there. \n\nAfter enough practice with silence the purple clouds show up. Mine are always moving, slowly, sometimes more of them sometimes less. Nothing more than that has happened though. Then there\u2019s the Taking Opportunity \u2013 I forgot if there\u2019s a name for that. I suspect there is. Opportunities will become more obvious so you will be able to take action immediately - like earlier while I was writing paragraph seven I had an opportunity to go and practice silence for a bit and had to take it. There\u2019s no longer something that stops you from doing what you decide to do so it becomes easier.

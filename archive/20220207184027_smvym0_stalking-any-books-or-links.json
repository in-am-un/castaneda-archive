He has a whole delusional path he's trying to pretend, a segment from the books that he didn't understand at all. He wants to copy that with the least work, so he can brag to himself and others.\n\nLittle Smoke designed darkroom, based on the idea that we needed to stop people from lying to themselves.\n\nSo the first thing is, you won't see nicely formed puffs, unless you really do learn to be silent.\n\nJust watching them will get your assemblage point to move down the center of the back, to halfway down to the red line.\n\nScooping the puffs causes your assemblage point to shift sideways a bit, because you are now treating them as \"real\".\n\nThat gives you some valuable memories, to help convince you this isn't all just in your head.\n\nAnd placing them there  on the torso amuses your double. I can see him saying, \"Oh, so that's how it is now?  Cool!!!\"\n\nHe can remote view anywhere in the universe, and actually has no  use for a body.\n\nIn fact, each puff is a piece of him, capable of viewing a different dream, all at once.\n\nWhen you gather them and place them on the pouches they stick, and you \"build an energy body\".\n\nOut of his awareness!\n\nThose \"pouches\" are sticky for that kind of energy. It will remain there, somewhat.\n\nAnd when you mix that with tensegrity, which was designed to \"fascinate\" your double, he might actually pretend to be a copy of you, just so he can do the movements too.\n\nNow you're developing a friendship with him. He'll think it's funny to make his arm \"real\", and stick it next to your real hands, which are doing tensegrity.\n\nHe's a prankster!\n\nAnd his \"eyes\" are magical.\n\nYours are crummy.\n\nToo much shit from the river of shit, was thrown in your eyes.\n\nSo having the double's eyes, increases the amazing sights you see, dragging your assemblage point to the \"shift below\".\n\nTo the place of super amazing \"dark magic\".\n\nWhen you get there, ask again!\n\nBut, if you have an AMAZING purple puff in the air, and you can put  your hand under it, try making it \"swirl\" by scooping up any yellow you see, to stuff in the middle of that puff.\n\nOr if you see swirls of jet blackness, use your hands to cause it to flow around the puff.\n\nIf you keep emphasizing silence, it'll be easier to remove the remaining traces of  the internal dialogue, and you can end up turning that purple puff into a \"power object\".\n\nIt's actually an \"evil\" process, but I'll let you figure out why it's evil.\n\nJust gaze at the power object, to figure out what it's used for.\n\nAt the very least, most power objects made from puffs, can be used as a \"lantern\" to shine light on the room, one part at a time, so you can see what's \"hiding\" in it.\n\nBut accept anything as an object, don't look for bats or something concrete.\n\nFor example, maybe the wall is now made out of cracked mud.  Or maybe you can \"shine\" your power object on the bedspread, and remote view anywhere in the world.\n\n(You can!)\n\nNow, if you do that, don't do it daily.  You'll learn the \"doing\" of the red zone, and it will be hard to move out of it, to the front.  Your stomping around on the wild plants and grass will \"wear a flat spot\".\n\nAnd your attention will always flock to that spot, as you \"pass through the red zone\".  You'll get stuck and need a witch like Cholita to rescue you.\n\nFlorinda had to rescue Miles once, back in the 90s.\n\nAnother thing  you can do with the puffs, is \"stretch them\".\n\nStretch it as wide as you can, like taking a pizza still in it's dough form, and pulling it from each side, as far as it can go, without breaking.\n\nThen lay that flat on the air, in front of you.\n\nIf it remains, you can use your hands to \"smooth it larger\".\n\nI like to stretch it into a road. It becomes a very real road, running through the middle of the room.\n\nOnce you realize it does in fact look like a road, you get to find out what \"kind of road\" it is.\n\nThat's a \"gift\" from the spirit.\n\nThis technique is \"repeatable\".\n\nI've stretched it into a dirt road, so I could dig with my fingers along the way, and \"shapeshift\" as a result.\n\nCholita likes to decorate her road with an old wooden fence and landscaping behind it, and then link it to hell.  So it becomes, \"the road to hell\".\n\nLet's face it.  Heaven is more boring than Hell.\n\nNice decorations up there however.  I think they shop at \"Pier 1 imports\".\n\nBut you could make it into the road leading up to the Gates of heaven if you had a catholic upbringing.\n\nI'm not sure if you'd find Saint Peter at the gate, but you might.  If you do, asking him who he thinks he's fooling with that \"Lucifer\" myth?\n\nBut my favorite thing of all, is to use the road to play with one of my inorganic beings.\n\nIt's a \"complex\" activity, requiring multiple skills all at once.\n\nThe first time, I asked Fancy \"Hey, look it's a road!  Let's pretend it's the freeway going North out of Tokyo.\"\n\n\"You go steal one of those small blue trucks that runs on diesel, drive  up on it, and we'll let the freeway be elevated above the forest.  Like in the real forest above Tokyo.\"\n\n\"Ok\", she replied.\n\nThen I added, \"But would you mind having the brakes go out, and  you crash off the side of the freeway overpass, tumble down 100 feet, and burst into flames at the bottom? In the middle of a cleared area in the forest so I can stand there and see when you hit the ground?\"\n\nI felt bad, but Fancy just said, \"Let's do it!\"\n\n\"I'll get a film crew\", I answered.  Just to make it seem justified.  But I forgot that detail, the instant I saw a tiny truck way up high, driving down the highway north of Tokyo, and 100 feet above my dark room.\n\nThe \"film crew\"  just slipped my mind.\n\nI suppose the best answer to your question is, you haven't gone far enough or it would be a lot more fun, and you'd be suggesting things others might want to try.\n\nThat's what Juann was posting about a few days ago.  That if we want to be safe in here, and not keep losing people, we need to get  them to where Julian and La Catalina liked to play.\n\nAnd, keep in mind.\n\nYour double is the only one who can do the coolest stuff I just described.\n\nBut you never lay down, never go to sleep, never close your eyes.\n\nThere's no sign at all that you just mutated into your dreaming body.\n\nI could walk over to the lights to the darkroom, while watching Fancy burn in agony inside an old Japanese truck, in the forest.\n\nThen switch on the lights and go to the bathroom.\n\nSo why are we plagued with new people who want to \"fold in half\", so they can complete a tiny story from Zuleica's passages?\n\nBecause, those people are obsessed with other people. Not with learning sorcery.\n\nBut they see that this subreddit is unique, due to the pictures.\n\nSo why they behave so badly, is beyond me.\n\nMental illness, perhaps.", "edited": 1645827033.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hyfi9c3", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very difficult question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll answer it, but I think you won&amp;#39;t understand completely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The puff is a &amp;quot;lie detector&amp;quot; for people who make up success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Believe me, that&amp;#39;s nearly the entire community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go read pesky tiger eye&amp;#39;s posts.

He&amp;#39;ll think it&amp;#39;s funny to make his arm &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;, and stick it next to your real hands, which are doing tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s a prankster!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And his &amp;quot;eyes&amp;quot; are magical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yours are crummy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too much shit from the river of shit, was thrown in your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So having the double&amp;#39;s eyes, increases the amazing sights you see, dragging your assemblage point to the &amp;quot;shift below&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the place of super amazing &amp;quot;dark magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you get there, ask again!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, if you have an AMAZING purple puff in the air, and you can put  your hand under it, try making it &amp;quot;swirl&amp;quot; by scooping up any yellow you see, to stuff in the middle of that puff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if you see swirls of jet blackness, use your hands to cause it to flow around the puff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you keep emphasizing silence, it&amp;#39;ll be easier to remove the remaining traces of  the internal dialogue, and you can end up turning that purple puff into a &amp;quot;power object&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually an &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; process, but I&amp;#39;ll let you figure out why it&amp;#39;s evil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just gaze at the power object, to figure out what it&amp;#39;s used for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the very least, most power objects made from puffs, can be used as a &amp;quot;lantern&amp;quot; to shine light on the room, one part at a time, so you can see what&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;hiding&amp;quot; in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But accept anything as an object, don&amp;#39;t look for bats or something concrete.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, maybe the wall is now made out of cracked mud.  Or maybe you can &amp;quot;shine&amp;quot; your power object on the bedspread, and remote view anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(You can!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if you do that, don&amp;#39;t do it daily.  You&amp;#39;ll learn the &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot; of the red zone, and it will be hard to move out of it, to the front.  Your stomping around on the wild plants and grass will &amp;quot;wear a flat spot&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And your attention will always flock to that spot, as you &amp;quot;pass through the red zone&amp;quot;.  You&amp;#39;ll get stuck and need a witch like Cholita to rescue you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Florinda had to rescue Miles once, back in the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing  you can do with the puffs, is &amp;quot;stretch them&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stretch it as wide as you can, like taking a pizza still in it&amp;#39;s dough form, and pulling it from each side, as far as it can go, without breaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then lay that flat on the air, in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it remains, you can use your hands to &amp;quot;smooth it larger&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to stretch it into a road. It becomes a very real road, running through the middle of the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you realize it does in fact look like a road, you get to find out what &amp;quot;kind of road&amp;quot; it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;gift&amp;quot; from the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This technique is &amp;quot;repeatable&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve stretched it into a dirt road, so I could dig with my fingers along the way, and &amp;quot;shapeshift&amp;quot; as a result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita likes to decorate her road with an old wooden fence and landscaping behind it, and then link it to hell.  So it becomes, &amp;quot;the road to hell&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s face it.  Heaven is more boring than Hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nice decorations up there however.  I think they shop at &amp;quot;Pier 1 imports&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you could make it into the road leading up to the Gates of heaven if you had a catholic upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if you&amp;#39;d find Saint Peter at the gate, but you might.  If you do, asking him who he thinks he&amp;#39;s fooling with that &amp;quot;Lucifer&amp;quot; myth?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my favorite thing of all, is to use the road to play with one of my inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;complex&amp;quot; activity, requiring multiple skills all at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time, I asked Fancy &amp;quot;Hey, look it&amp;#39;s a road!  Let&amp;#39;s pretend it&amp;#39;s the freeway going North out of Tokyo.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You go steal one of those small blue trucks that runs on diesel, drive  up on it, and we&amp;#39;ll let the freeway be elevated above the forest.  Like in the real forest above Tokyo.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ok&amp;quot;, she replied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I added, &amp;quot;But would you mind having the brakes go out, and  you crash off the side of the freeway overpass, tumble down 100 feet, and burst into flames at the bottom? In the middle of a cleared area in the forest so I can stand there and see when you hit the ground?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt bad, but Fancy just said, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s do it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll get a film crew&amp;quot;, I answered.  Just to make it seem justified.  But I forgot that detail, the instant I saw a tiny truck way up high, driving down the highway north of Tokyo, and 100 feet above my dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;film crew&amp;quot;  just slipped my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose the best answer to your question is, you haven&amp;#39;t gone far enough or it would be a lot more fun, and you&amp;#39;d be suggesting things others might want to try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what Juann was posting about a few days ago.  That if we want to be safe in here, and not keep losing people, we need to get  them to where Julian and La Catalina liked to play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your double is the only one who can do the coolest stuff I just described.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you never lay down, never go to sleep, never close your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no sign at all that you just mutated into your dreaming body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could walk over to the lights to the darkroom, while watching Fancy burn in agony inside an old Japanese truck, in the forest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then switch on the lights and go to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why are we plagued with new people who want to &amp;quot;fold in half&amp;quot;, so they can complete a tiny story from Zuleica&amp;#39;s passages?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because, those people are obsessed with other people. Not with learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they see that this subreddit is unique, due to the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why they behave so badly, is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mental illness, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_smvym0", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/smvym0/stalking_any_books_or_links/hyfi9c3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1645823028.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1645823028.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hyez56t", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "bjjmike69", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hw0gub3", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_5v5stbcb", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Are you supposed to focus on the pink and purple puffs?

Always closed eye, falling asleep, exaggerating his ordinary dreams into magic.\n\na bad man...\n\n\\&gt;Is this an exact replica of the room or a mental construction of it or neither?\n\nReality as perceived by the double is like a series of film frames, stacked up.\n\nIf you look closely, each one has a slight change in it.\n\nThe double wanders around in ordinary dreams, and we're all familiar with that process.  He goes randomly between frames in the film, some so different from the last, it's hard to imagine he can feel any actual \"flow\" of time.\n\nWe just don't realize, that's the same \"double\" as everyone wants to bring out with 4 gates dreaming. It's the coolest accomplishment.\n\nAnd  yet, we go inside them every night.\n\nHe's just lost in endless phantom copies of the world.  Or anywhere in the universe, including abstract locations we couldn't even withstand.\n\nWhen he comes out in the darkroom, for something magical like shapeshifting, and you turn  yourself into an animal of some kind, it feels like \"you\".  You don't notice anything odd.\n\nWhat you don't realize is, you just changed over to him.\n\nYou go outside, and the world is empty.  There's no people when there should be!\n\nBut otherwise, there's absolutely no way (at the time) to tell it's not your actual neighborhood, minus the people.\n\nIt even hurts like hell, if your witch roommate puts some sharp pebbles in your path.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be an empty world.\n\nHe could have put you into the \"precise same\" copy of reality, as your tonal is  using.\n\nSame with seeing the room with  your eyes close.\n\nMight be the actual room.  Might be a slightly different copy.\n\nMight be the fancy Men's rest room at the   Four Seasons in LA.\n\nBut you'd think it was \"your room\".\n\nYou'd be looking at the stack of clean white towels next to the shiny gold plated water faucets for washing up, thinking, \"Yes, that's absolutely my room.  Every detail is precise.\"\n\nUnless you read around a lot in here, you won't understand this statement and might take it as an insult.  But if you learn what we have available, it'll just make you laugh.\n\nYou got book dealed.  Your expectations for the type of magic we do, are tainted by the made up pretend kind, everyone else is selling.\n\nAt first, you'll learn new \"rules\" and start to understand them.\n\nYou'll lose most of that book deal mind.\n\nAnd you'll have darkroom successes!\n\nYou've overcome the first enemy, fear, and now you have clarity.\n\nOr maybe it's still just sobriety.\n\nSoon you'll know all the rules of what's what and how it works, and realize,  some of what we do would be considered \"invalid\",  by most people.\n\nLike, if it's the bathroom at the Hilton, that means you really **didn't** see the room with your eyes closed.\n\nExcept you forget.  That's dreaming awake!\n\nWho the hell can do that?\n\nNot even the Buddha or  he wouldn't have made up so many things.\n\nIf he could dream with his eyes open, or see where he was with \"remote viewing\", he couldn't do it on a regular basis, and certainly not for hours a night. Or he would have evolved, and destroyed the church that was growing up, as harmful to others. He was never \"wise\". Just book dealed.\n\nBut then as you come to accept \"invalid\" perceptions, \"stuff happens\". Like you dream up your phantom Hilton bathroom  thinking,  \"Ok, this is not a real place. But at least it's entertaining.\"\n\nAnd then, you wake up in the Hilton.\n\nOr you find Cholita there too, and she shows you a picture on her cellphone, which she repeats the next day, when you are \"awake\".\n\nAnd then you can't explain how that's possible.\n\nBut that's not the end of it. At some point the whole thing starts to be filled with irrational things.\n\nSuch as \"abstract translocation\".\n\nWhere the phantom room you see, is impossible to describe.\n\nNot even a word!\n\nAnd yet, you just got through swimming in it and exploring, for a full hour.\n\n\\&gt;I've found myself in my room after going to sleep but wasn't there long enough to confirm this.\n\nYou brought out your \"second attention\".  That's all that matters there.\n\nIt's like I said, at first we're all ruined by the book deal mind.\n\nSo hidden in that sentence of yours, is worry about being punished for making a mistake.  Got to \"get things right\", or Mommy will punish us.\n\nSorcerers are different.\n\nAnything you can perceive, is real.\n\nDoesn't matter what or how.\n\nWe don't censor ourselves.\n\nAnd don't worry, plenty of \"laws of physics\" defying stuff happens over the years.\n\nNot on demand, but how often do you have to break the laws of physics, to be willing to perceive anything you can perceive?\n\n...\n\nNo, really.  I'm actually asking.\n\nHow many times???\n\nI'd love to know that myself.\n\nIt \"comes up\". You'll see.\n\nAt one point you completely realize, what do I care what other people think about all this???", "edited": 1644360812.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hw59pzi", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Does that interfere with your sleep or is part of it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re married and expected to lay in bed next to another person at least 6 hours a night, yes it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just do 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, any beginner who claims to do 3  hours, as I&amp;#39;ve been recommending, is expected to lie and only do 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Juan and I can get to the red zone in 5 minutes these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Techno hits the green line in less than a minute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I believe Juan was implying, somewhere in here, that he thought the long sessions were very important for a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The implication being, once you get to the deep red, you could cut back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But any time at all during which  you force silence, and increase how long you can do that, by even 1 second, is a very good thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The witches were  pretty lenient on how long people needed to practice, and how serious they needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, not a single person learned enough magic to look like they weren&amp;#39;t just repeating what any Buddhist or Hindu can do with meditation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing happened, to prove Carlos didn&amp;#39;t just make it all up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;#39;d fully realized how the reputation of Carlos was going to be completely trashed, and everything in his books on the road to being lost as make believe, I hope they wouldn&amp;#39;t have behaved like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was just reading workshop lecture notes, and I was HORRIFIED by the things they said to workshop crowds.

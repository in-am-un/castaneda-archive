It never happened. Just keep that in mind.\n\nOne of Carlos' students ran into a double woman.   She was helping people understand the self-checkout terminals in a retail store. She figured he was a confused old man who couldn't understand computers, and came over asking if he needed help to work the terminal.  Actually, he'd been studying the machine to try to figure out if it was windows or Linux based.\n\nHe looked up to see who had asked, and discovered she was a double woman.  \"I always need help!\", he told her.\n\nHe spent a year figuring out how to get her to hang out around him, so he could see what could come of it.   The energy given off by a double woman is very useful.\n\nHe discovered that she had 4 or 5 close friends she commonly went bar hoping with, all of whom were of complementary personality types. Together with her as the center, it was a complete group of witches.\n\nHe spent the next 2 years trying to get them all together at once with him around. That was difficult, because they were all at least 30 years younger than him and only interested in partying.  They had learned to use the energy of the double woman to attract men (and trouble) in bars, and when she lost energy and started to crash, they all surrounded her and propped her back up, using their own energy.\n\nThey had already formed an energetic group on their own.  Getting them together to redirect their energy towards something better seemed like a promising idea.\n\nHe succeeded, but while they were together all the omens were wrong. They got lost, they fought, some made passes at him, and then they got jealous of each other, and the group fell apart.\n\nIf he'd just gone with their tendency to try to figure out who's considered more desirable, the main concern they had in life, they might have been able to hold up.\n\nCarlos merely created a social structure that could hold up, seeing as how he didn't have all of don Juan's cohorts at his disposal, to form personal bonds with the apprentices.\n\nThat didn't work out for the sorcerer in this imaginary story, but years later he told me that during the course of the evening with the 5 women, he saw an omen that held the answer for how to perpetuate Carlos' teachings.\n\nAny time you \"jump\", and try something farfetched, which only a sorcerer would attempt,  *intent* is likely to support you.

He started to wonder how on earth he could keep 5 young women entertained so that he could repeat this, should it be a success.\n\nHe looked over to where the women were sitting, and all of their faces were bathed in a bright blue light.   They were literally glowing!  They seemed to be hypnotized, not moving at all. They were all looking down towards their feet,  and in no further need of entertainment.\n\nHe'd never seen such a sight in his life!

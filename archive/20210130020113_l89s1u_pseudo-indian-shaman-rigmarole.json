They either show up, or they don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you do the &amp;quot;ritual&amp;quot;, they show up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the value of the rigmarole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can explore that yourself, once you gain an IOB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even my new IOB, &amp;quot;Mystery&amp;quot;, turns out to like the rituals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She shows up every time I do my &amp;quot;fishing&amp;quot; technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night she was already floating in the air, when she saw I was preparing to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her (but she looks sort of like a male most of the time), &amp;quot;You have to be down on the floor, as a fish.  Otherwise this won&amp;#39;t work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she obeyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After fishing and &amp;quot;catching&amp;quot; her, I did an extension to the fishing.  Catch and release.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I released her, she began to tell me stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very odd stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s quite different from Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the rituals also help to figure out how to deal with each type you gain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose the very elaborate rituals to summon little smoke using the mushrooms, and how much time it takes to prepare, really just serves to get little smoke into that mode he&amp;#39;s been in before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t dismiss the rituals.  Don Juan might not have needed them to teach Carlos, but Carlos ended up learning them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And maybe, all that was for our benefit too.

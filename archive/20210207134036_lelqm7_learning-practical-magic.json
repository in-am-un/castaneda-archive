I can show you something.\"\n\nIt's more like, you find that you can toss a pink puff at the wall, and it smashes into multicolor pieces.\n\nYou try it again, and the largest piece, more purple,  has her face on it.  Which makes  you try it again.\n\nAt that point, she moves from purple puff to purple puff only.  Seemingly randomly, but it's always the purple ones.\n\nShe's \"teaching\" you.  You probably won't figure out what, for weeks.\n\nBut, she can also simply talk and say, \"I'll teach you pink to purple puffery.\"\n\nThey only seem to talk to me, when they are VERY real looking.  Which is not as often as I'd like.\n\nIn tiny head mode, they only \"show\" you, and it's hard to believe that is really going on, until you see the results.\n\nTheory: It's hard for them to look that real. It's not an easy coincidence involving only you.\n\nThey use up steam doing that.\n\nDepending on the position of your assemblage point.\n\nIt's natural for them to be very real when it's far down.\n\nBut they can \"reach up\" energetically to help when your assemblage point hasn't dropped low enough.\n\nFor a while.

Just like we can't say how far down the assemblage point can move in ordinary dreams.  You and I can both testify, it doesn't make it to heightened awareness or you'd wake up with the breathing changed, in bliss. \n\nInstead, you wake up grumpy.  But while in there, it can move quite far down (resulting in very bizarre dreams).\n\n3 ) I don't know.  Scooping onto the abdomen does in fact help bring the double out.  Carlos didn't emphasize it for no reason.\n\nIt really does, \"build the energy body\".  \n\nZuleica said, you have to pull the light closer to the center.\n\nBut I suspect those are just tricks. If focuses the attention in the direction of perceiving the energy body. \n\nSo that Silvio's method  to change bodies can work. The one where you simply glance down at it.\n\nThat's my story and I'm sticking to it for now.  Could be proven wrong later.\n\nBut for sure, there's a lot of trickery in what we read.\n\nFor example, you feel peanut butter on your hands while doing the \"claw technique\".\n\nDon Juan says, \"Yes, that's the peanut butter of infinity!  Exactly what we were after.\"\n\nHe's just trying to add some \"intent\" to the situation. Make it seem more normal and real.\n\nPutting puffs on the abdomen will help the dreaming body come out.\n\nLooking in the puffs at dreams might make it interested, which would also help lure the dreaming double out.\n\nYou can get it interested!  It's alive and aware, and slightly naughty.\n\nIf it's interested, it shows up.  Or \"comes out\" if you like.  \n\nHowever, it becomes visible at the position of silent knowledge, at the end of the J curve.\n\nIt can come out, before that.\n\nVisible and \"comes out\" are not the same thing.\n\nYou should investigate for us whether studying the details of the puffs is  better than simply placing them on the abdomen.\n\nOn the other hand, you could look for those Disneyland pins people collect, so they can put them all over their coat on a visit.\n\nFind those in the puffs, and when you place them on your torso, let them remain in place.\n\nThat's deviant practical magic.  Going a little too far, but perfectly possible.\n\nWhen the double fully comes out, I'll predict it won't be what you expected. There will be some \"anomalies\".\n\nIt's not as simple as you and it, standing far apart.\n\nAnd it's not as simple as, if it comes out it sees the same things you do, 100% of the time.\n\n4 ) Yes, absolutely.\n\nAnd wave your arms in the air, to see the dark ripples or echoes.\n\nAnd look at the whitish light you can see on surfaces, but on something only a couple of feet away.\n\nFeel the silent static electricity feeling.  As if looking at that sight, and the ripples, causes some weird silence that feels like a Van-De-Graff making your hair stand up.\n\nBut without actually moving.\n\nThose are what I can feel, when the fibers around the waist become fully visible.\n\nThe stuff you are describing is like the \"shell\" for those, and they come out from that.\n\nI have the advantage of Cholita, who's shown me it in full resolution, several times.\n\nWhen I ask if she knows she did that, she gets angry.\n\nWhen she does it, she laughs.\n\nWitches...\n\nGotta love them.

Make it seem more normal and real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Putting puffs on the abdomen will help the dreaming body come out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking in the puffs at dreams might make it interested, which would also help lure the dreaming double out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can get it interested!  It&amp;#39;s alive and aware, and slightly naughty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s interested, it shows up.  Or &amp;quot;comes out&amp;quot; if you like.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it becomes visible at the position of silent knowledge, at the end of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can come out, before that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Visible and &amp;quot;comes out&amp;quot; are not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should investigate for us whether studying the details of the puffs is  better than simply placing them on the abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you could look for those Disneyland pins people collect, so they can put them all over their coat on a visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find those in the puffs, and when you place them on your torso, let them remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s deviant practical magic.  Going a little too far, but perfectly possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the double fully comes out, I&amp;#39;ll predict it won&amp;#39;t be what you expected. There will be some &amp;quot;anomalies&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not as simple as you and it, standing far apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s not as simple as, if it comes out it sees the same things you do, 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 ) Yes, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And wave your arms in the air, to see the dark ripples or echoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And look at the whitish light you can see on surfaces, but on something only a couple of feet away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel the silent static electricity feeling.  As if looking at that sight, and the ripples, causes some weird silence that feels like a Van-De-Graff making your hair stand up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But without actually moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are what I can feel, when the fibers around the waist become fully visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stuff you are describing is like the &amp;quot;shell&amp;quot; for those, and they come out from that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have the advantage of Cholita, who&amp;#39;s shown me it in full resolution, several times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I ask if she knows she did that, she gets angry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she does it, she laughs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Witches...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gotta love them.

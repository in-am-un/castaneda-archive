Never change ANY of your bad habits, or lifestyle.\n\nUNTIL you actually see the reason for doing so, in terms of supernatural events no one would believe even if you told them.\n\nOtherwise you'll turn yourself into some kind of ugly \"pious saint\" type.  An annoying \"Yoga Man\" who washes his nose out with salt water 3 times a day, and \"retains sperm\".\n\nA pretender.\n\nIf you engage in pretending to be saintly, you'll never actually get around to working hard to learn for real.\n\nYou'll just \"pacify\" yourself and remain clueless until you die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Some Attackers of Carlos", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Flyers (counter intent)"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"0i3pe71qlzic1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0i3pe71qlzic1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18f22b05b3d8a4706c5e655b7767b9ddbbe8eaee"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0i3pe71qlzic1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d65cc42970112aff16f5af596c4d368e57d140e"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0i3pe71qlzic1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ffdd1cf9d6249695b8f66ae58bace74f62cf014"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0i3pe71qlzic1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=902d2ba0bc0fabb3fd076b593f8fec48b83cfa39"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0i3pe71qlzic1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75323405d8c3b9cccdd4e4ba36416ff1c9dfa9e9"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0i3pe71qlzic1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=989ed07909695848bc327b137e8d75671db5fbc5"}], "s": {"y": 3072, "x": 3072, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/0i3pe71qlzic1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37f2c6e1a0d439109f3c98b5d241b2d61f262a11"}, "id": "0i3pe71qlzic1"}, "l063ng53qyic1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 67, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l063ng53qyic1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a72a057275c51c106dfb48f16f6bf21fde0fedb"}, {"y": 135, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l063ng53qyic1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2bcb4d7ca5512fcace621d271ed4d7b3eb29005"}, {"y": 200, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l063ng53qyic1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9746257b18985815745b86e538e1a2e1d223026f"}, {"y": 400, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l063ng53qyic1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dfdeaf0de0084f72b5347c96c2dc3355c173cf0"}, {"y": 600, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l063ng53qyic1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=278d6c25e04f778efa42dfaaa9235e08b8820ae6"}, {"y": 676, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l063ng53qyic1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f6aa526d80dc6a109ceea43a950b188ceac9d29"}], "s": {"y": 1091, "x": 1743, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l063ng53qyic1.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed8dcecf71a04bd0a3f093d9fff05d48a30d7dee"}, "id": "l063ng53qyic1"}}, "name": "t3_1asarmp", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Flyers (counter intent)", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/8GNLSbaR6nb2AwMXIuJDMHf7Jl-cXzegwQgV3gx_6hs.jpg", "edited": 1708106549.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1708095913.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0i3pe71qlzic1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=37f2c6e1a0d439109f3c98b5d241b2d61f262a11\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/0i3pe71qlzic1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=37f2c6e1a0d439109f3c98b5d241b2d61f262a11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, I admit it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only made this because I finally found a giant 1990s camcorder to put into the hands of &amp;quot;Shaman Bob&amp;quot;.

After having made it burp twice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once they burp, the water pressure is relieved, and unless someone jumps up and down on the floor, a cooler won&amp;#39;t burp again until someone takes water out from the faucet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even having it burp three times, didn&amp;#39;t convince people Carlos was telling us the truth that the allies were over there hanging out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so when he gave them to us, I seem to be the only one who got visited by them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until Cholita put an end to that a year or two ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still don&amp;#39;t know how she did that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bu1t5kuo71jc1.jpeg?width=5376&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=73ded15a107b079aaaa81192b9baf20362d90c13\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bu1t5kuo71jc1.jpeg?width=5376&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=73ded15a107b079aaaa81192b9baf20362d90c13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1asarmp", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1asarmp/some_attackers_of_carlos/kqrfkv9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1708126329.0, "media_metadata": {"bu1t5kuo71jc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpeg", "p": [{"y": 54, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bu1t5kuo71jc1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec43079236aaf467be4c88c84c525fb39d8d1c68"}, {"y": 108, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bu1t5kuo71jc1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a54463f2908a51392c96a7cddb4c06c327d410b5"}, {"y": 160, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bu1t5kuo71jc1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3712a6aa37a4d87fefddd862d3666020d318db20"}, {"y": 320, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bu1t5kuo71jc1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b32f3012e2b134525616e7c2486a50ce83f75d00"}, {"y": 480, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bu1t5kuo71jc1.jpeg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=042c3b55872a1fcb4e01910a892d3964c93f17cd"}, {"y": 540, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bu1t5kuo71jc1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15436f54bb89027c68e5ff79e4f0a7114d58bca5"}], "s": {"y": 2688, "x": 5376, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bu1t5kuo71jc1.jpeg?width=5376&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73ded15a107b079aaaa81192b9baf20362d90c13"}, "id": "bu1t5kuo71jc1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kqr4mxu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "aumuaum", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1708122185.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1asarmp", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_tofhuk7r", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "does it really say yoga and virtual reality on that building?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kqr4mxu", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;does it really say yoga and virtual reality on that building?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1asarmp/some_attackers_of_carlos/kqr4mxu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1708122185.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1asarmp", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}]

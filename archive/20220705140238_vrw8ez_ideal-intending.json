Mostly.  As it turns out, stories are often better for teaching sorcery because they \"frame\" the context in such a way that our own self interests are not provoked.\n\nSo you can set up a \"probe\" of reality which is in theory only.  Not anything someone would be concerned about.  So that no one gets their feathers ruffled, and you can let the story proceed to teach what you want to teach.\n\nIf telling the story to little girls, don't choose one about \"a beautiful princess\".\n\nNot a good choice for that audience, if you don't want them worrying about the story in ways that cause them to miss the point you wanted to convey.\n\nDon't tell the boys a story about the big school bully.\n\nI suppose you could say that the story needs to be \"neutral\".    So that no one \"cares\" about the framework.\n\nMy stories of the Wuwonians are good examples.  No one even knows who those are, so you don't get any \"sympathy\" or anger about them.  No one has been cheated by them, or rewarded.\n\nAnd their life is so weird, it doesn't align to ours at all.\n\nIt doesn't proke distractions.\n\nBy the way, I'm waiting for another.  But can't reach full on SK lately.  It should be a great story, if I can become empty enough.\n\nThe Wuwonian's niece slips into a crack in an old haunted house her uncles are investigating.  They keep searching the outside walls for openings, but the niece crawls in a crack and slides along boards traveling behind the walls at all angles, until she drops right into the living room of the house, then walks over and unlocks the door for her uncles.\n\nIt's a story about the difference between witches and male sorcerers.\n\nBut I don't have that one.  I couldn't create it myself. Only Silent Knowledge could get that story right.\n\nMy stories are crude.\n\nThe tensegrity is like that.  Each tensegrity move actually contains the makings of a \"story\".  In a crude form, but the story is still in there.\n\nAnd it's at a level that won't get us fussed up.  Just a \"piece\" of meaning, without enough context to be upsetting or thrilling.  Or thought provoking even, but that's dangerous waters when designing a new tensegrity pass.\n\nI'm sort of \"dancing around the issue\" here and about to blow it, but hopefully this will clarify it.\n\nA story.\n\nThere's a Genie.\n\nNot evil. Not a Jin.  But also has no desire to \"bless\" anyone, or create any \"happy endings\".\n\nIt exists to support reality.  Like a \"worker bee\".\n\nIt's never bored, never ambitious.  It has a job, and it does it.  No complaints, no regrets.\n\nThis Genie's job is to create reality for each human.\n\nAs it turns out in this Genie's' world, reality doesn't last very long.  It runs until it \"wears out\", and then a person experiencing that reality will fall into blankness. Inactive, with nothing to do, nothing to perceive.\n\nThey fall into \"the void\".\n\nThat costs the Genie's boss, an Eagle, to lose money.  He's on a tight schedule collecting memories.\n\nNo one knows why the eagle wants those.  Let's just assume that the Eagle isn't actually the boss of the whole affair.\n\nBut we'll probably never know why the eagle is so driven. To get memories.\n\nEven don Juan didn't know. As he said, sorcerers have no idea why the emanations create sensory data for humans, giving them the impression of a real place, with solid matter, laws of physics and such.\n\nIn fact, there's only sensory information.  No actual fixed reality.\n\nThere's too many emanations to use them all to create a reality!\n\nSo they're \"selected\".  By the Genie.\n\nSensory information is then radiated to us by the effect of our awareness focusing on the selected bundles of emanations.\n\nIt's a projected \"virtual reality\".\n\nBut it's so good we'll never believe that. It \"feels so real\"!\n\nWe'll surely never know why the Eagle (the emanations) does that.\n\nMeanwhile the Genie is just a worker and isn't driven by anything.\n\nExcept, he has to please the Eagle.  That's his one \"issue\".\n\nSo he checks out something humans can't.  How the eagle \"feels\" about something.\n\nWhen he has a choice for which reality to build, he'll tend to favor those which tickle the fancy of the eagle.  Make the eagle smile.\n\nPeople run out their piece of reality often.  The Genie  then makes them a new reality bubble, but the clock is still ticking and it runs down quickly.\n\nNeeding the Genie to make the next one.\n\nThe Genie has his hands full for sure!\n\nWhen he encounters someone who's \"gone blank\", he does his best to restore a reality bubble for them as fast as possible.\n\nAs you'll find out doing darkroom, he's not always there in time.  We go blank often when practicing darkroom.  And it's nearly impossible to tell for how long.  We estimate it by noticing we didn't fall over and bump our head on the floor.\n\nBut otherwise, we have no idea.\n\nNot that anything bad is ever likely to happen. When people \"go blank\", they're safe.  They aren't perceiving anything at all, so they just stand or sit there oblivious to everything.\n\nAnd since we're talking about \"reality\" here, nothing is going to damage them just because they aren't paying attention.  The whole thing is sort of \"shut down\".  Not entirely I suppose, but well enough to avoid harm.\n\nDid I mention the Genie's name is \"Intent\"?\n\nSo Intent finds a blanked out human.  He studies their clothes.   He studies the last reality bubble they came from.  He replays the last few seconds of it, to see if the human voiced any preferences.\n\nUsing anything at all, he tries to find a basis for the next reality bubble to give to that human.\n\nIt's never a problem, unless he runs into a sorcerer.\n\nSorcerers are tricky.  They're on to the Genie.\n\nThey've learned the rules the Genie uses when searching for criteria to use in the next reality bubble.\n\nAnd they can eliminate all of it.  Leaving just \"one\" thing for the Genie to find.\n\nKeep in mind, the Genie uses EVERYTHING it can find.\n\nIt'll even reach back into the past to find criteria.   If the human was obsessed with something in the past, and the Genie's supply of information from the present is low, it'll use the past.\n\nBut sorcerers learned to blank out even their past, using various techniques we can't afford to go into here because this story would no longer be \"neutral\".  It would mess up my attempts to show the \"heart of the matter\", when it comes to manipulating the Genie known as \"Intent\".\n\nI don't know why, but this reminds me of something humorous in the life cycle of babies.\n\nAnd I believe it won't cause anyone to get fussy, if this is mentioned in the course of this story.\n\nBabies like to be held, and will even cry if left on the carpet too long.\n\nAnd since they love to be held, mothers have learned amazing skills of carrying them around, nearly effortlessly.\n\nI suppose they prop the baby against their hip when necessary, to free an arm for doing something.\n\nBut at some point, babies only want transportation.  Not to be carried all the time.\n\nSo they learn how to \"get off\", even against the mother's will.\n\nAs best I can figure out, they arch their backs so that the mom has nothing to prop against her hip.\n\nOr wherever she wedges them with, to prevent sliding off.\n\nNot only do they arch their back the wrong way, so that there's nothing on their torso or butt to catch a bump on the mother and hold the baby in place, but they actually stick their arms up high, so those will slide through any grip also.\n\nThey turn into a smooth rod that can't be grabbed or supported on any curve or bend it has.\n\nThey just learn how to \"slip off\".\n\nThat's what sorcerers do.  They remove anything the Genie can find, to support his next reality bubble.\n\nExcept for one single thing.  The thing they want the Genie to use.\n\nSo that they can control Intent.\n\nIt's not as easy as it sounds!\n\nDid you ever know a little kid who was pulling a prank on his mom, but couldn't keep from giggling?\n\nOr looking over at the Dad to get a smile, because they were both in on the gag?\n\nMom isn't going to be fooled.  The kid just can't hide his own behavioral evidence of the coming prank.\n\nIn fact, while speaking to the mom to set up the prank, the kid can barely finish a sentence without giggling.\n\nEven Carlos did that a few times, when wanting to tell a dirty joke in private class.\n\nHe couldn't get it out, without laughing first.\n\nOr that seemed to be what was going on.  More likely is, he was setting us up.\n\nThat's us.\n\nNot the ones planning it as Carlos likely did.\n\nWe're like that kid who can't control himself.\n\nSome worse than others.\n\nThe bad players who come in here stink of the giggling child who is pranking someone.\n\nAnyone who's been reading in here a while can easily spot a bad guy coming here to steal or  cause trouble.\n\nThat person will never be able to do what sorcerers do, making themselves so empty that the Genie can't find any criteria to create the next reality bubble other than what the sorcerer wants him to find.\n\nThe bad players are excluded from ever seeing what sorcerers are doing, because they're too fussy to find such a thing.\n\nAnd so without ever seeing it, even a tiny bit, there's no hope for them to \"wake up\" and start to remove their wrong behavior.\n\nThey just give in to it, hoping to demand what they want from the Genie, using force, blackmail, threats, or self-pity.\n\nInstead of being like the smart baby, who knows how to turn himself into a greased glass rod with nothing for the mom to hold onto. Guaranteeing he'll slip from her grip.\n\nThe bad player babies just cry and make a fuss, and try to annoy the mom so much she'll obey their demands and set them down on the floor.\n\nWhich I suppose would be ok as far as this subreddit goes. Let them play in the dirt.\n\nThe problem is, they insist the mother has to watch them play.\n\nSo the instant she does what they want and sets them down, her day is ruined.  She has to give them 100% of her attention, or they'll start crying again. If that doesn't work, they throw a tantrum.\n\nAngry babies can't be allowed to build up in this subreddit, or the whole quest is over.\n\nIt's why there's no magic in the world. The percentage of fussy babies is too high to allow a place where people can observe and learn to do what the sorcerers do.\n\nEmpty themselves, so that only one single clue remains for Intent to find when it goes to create the next reality bubble.\n\nI posted a long time ago how this subreddit was wondering if it was possible to use a sleeping mask, instead of a dark room, and suddenly while walking along I found a brand new sleeping mask in my path.\n\nI had to avoid stepping on it!\n\nI wasn't walking along thinking, \"I should figure out where you buy sleeping masks, so I can try that out for others!\"\n\nOr even , \"Man, I got to do everything?   I have to actually wear that awful thing, when I have a perfectly nice dark room?\"\n\nI didn't even remember I wanted a mask.\n\nBut there was some discussion in here prior to me finding one,  where I suggested I'd look into it.\n\nAnd laziness had put it off until I totally forget.\n\nIntent did not.  For whatever reason, when it created my \"go for a walk\" reality bubble that day the sleeping mask element was included.\n\nAnd included brilliantly!  That Genie is quite intelligent.\n\nA sleeping mask at the start of my walk would have been a burden.  Can you put sleeping masks into your pocket?  Won't they bend and no longer be light tight?\n\nDid I want to carefully carry the mask by it's rubber band, so it wouldn't get wet from my sweaty hands?\n\nI'd probably be motivated to ignore it as too much trouble.\n\nMy original desire was to find one somewhere, maybe at the grocery store in the sleep products section.\n\nAnd just stick it in my shopping cart for later.\n\nSo the Genie did a very good job with the sleeping mask part of the reality bubble.\n\nHe placed  it where I couldn't possibly miss it, and only 20 feet from the door of my business.\n\nSo that all I had to do was pick it up, and walk back to my desk.  Set it down by my car keys, and my intent to acquire a sleeping mask was fulfilled.\n\nIt was an \"accidental perfect intend\".\n\nI don't know why that worked so well, but possibly it's because the Eagle smiled in such a way that Intent was guided to \"emphasize\" that request it found in my memory.  And do an extra good job with that one.\n\nIt was very poor intending on my part, but I \"got lucky\".\n\nA real sorcerer empties everything, until there's only one thing left for Intent to find.  A guaranteed reality bubble to the liking of the sorcerer.\n\nBut sorcerers also have to intend things on behalf of the apprentices.\n\nSo they learned how to \"tickle the fancy\" of the eagle.  To get him to help emphasize the elements that the Intent Genie might normally consider less important than all the other stuff the apprentice has going on.\n\nI suppose the story of Julian casting don Juan into a river to drown is a good example.\n\nDon Juan's \"reality bubble\" was about to expire as Julian lifted him, and started to speak.\n\nDon Juan had no idea what Julian was about to do.  But as usual, he suspected some cool magic was going to happen.\n\nThe last thing he heard before Julian tossed him into the raging river, was Julian's effort to sway the eagle towards don Juan surviving, instead of drowning.\n\nBoth were possible, in the new reality bubble Julian forced off on don Juan.\n\nIntent,  the Genie,  still had to form that reality bubble.\n\nBut Julian boldly exclaimed, knowing the Eagle was watching, \"For goodness sake, don't hate the river!\"\n\nThe Eagle found that amusing.\n\nSo while nearly drowning, don Juan's double came out to rescue him and don Juan ended up \"not hating\" the river.\n\nIn fact, it became the ride of his life!\n\nHe learned about his double.\n\nDon Juan had all sorts of nonsense flowing around inside him at the moment the Intent Genie had to create his reality bubble.\n\nWithout the help of Julian's exclamation to the Eagle, don Juan's chances to survive were slim indeed.\n\nBut he \"inserted\" an element into the information the Genie used to create the new reality bubble.\n\nWasn't much.  But Don Juan heard what he said.  So it became part of the awareness and history of don Juan.\n\nThe Genie only uses that.  From the human for which the bubble is being made.\n\nIt's only when there's absolutely nothing to go by, that the Genie will examine outside stuff.\n\nFor instance, we try to pick up the intent trails of the old seers.   My latest is trying to pick up the shapeshifting feeling they liked, so it is used by the affection for the energy body pass, when the form ends and the Genie creates a new reality bubble.\n\nWe darken the room, to remove as many \"intent influences\" as possible.\n\nIt's a pretty simple trick!  Less \"choices\" for the Genie.\n\nThe darkness, and my ability to remove my internal dialogue, allows me to \"feel\" the feelings of the old seers from the past, so the Genie causes that tensegrity form to shapeshift me.  At the end, when that reality bubble runs out.\n\nTensegrity creates reality bubbles.  Which guide how the Genie makes the next one when the form ends.\n\nDuring the form, the assemblage point is drifting.\n\nAfter the form, you get to see \"the results\".\n\nOf course, the results are visible all along the way if you can see energy.  But at the end of the form, there's also a potential \"result\".  One that will only come into being, in absolute silence.\n\nSo Julian, being a masterful sorcerer, could completely \"empty\" himself of any criteria the Genie might use to create the next reality bubble for Julian. Except the \"one thing\" Julian wanted him to find.\n\nIt's what sorcerers do!\n\nBut he could also \"add that\" to the many elements don Juan had available for the Genie to use, and Julian could add it in such a way that it made the eagle smile.\n\nAnd so when the Genie formed the bubble, and was deciding what the chances were for don Juan not to drown, he caught the Eagle smiling at the element of \"don't hate the river!\"\n\nSo the Genie said, \"Ok boss. He won't hate it.  I'll see to that.\"\n\nSo what's to gain from this story?  For a beginner.\n\nSorcery is \"The Mastery of Intent\".\n\nIt's not a book deal.  You can't possibly learn it, if the Intent Genie finds that desire inside you.\n\nHe's not going to \"judge\" you as a bad guy.\n\nI might, but he won't.\n\nHe'll just create a reality bubble that leads you along that path too.\n\nAnd the elements inside you which might have given you a chance to actually learn sorcery, will be buried by your greed.\n\nYou won't learn!  If you think you can do both, you're really clueless.\n\nSorcery is like drowning in the raging river.\n\nIf don Juan had been thinking how cool it would be to end up on the front of the \"Mexico City Press\" newspaper in the morning, as a sad drowning victim, with the story of his wonderful life also printed so that readers would feel real sorrow at his drowning, he'd be screwed. He'd drown.\n\nThat \"element\" would have been too strong and the Intent Genie would have selected that reality bubble.\n\nThe same happens to bad players in here.  There's no way they're going to learn.  Because learning sorcery is not important to them.  They want attention.\n\nAnd so the Genie will create a reality bubble for them, which does not have the goal of helping them learn sorcery.\n\nTo learn sorcery, you have to \"intend\" it.\n\nThe way sorcerers do.  By emptying themselves of all other goals and desires, but the single one they need the Genie to use next, to make their reality bubble.\n\nApprentices can't manage that, so sorcerers give them \"techniques\".\n\nLike tensegrity.\n\nThe tensegrity contains some \"intending elements\" that the Genie will notice.\n\nThen by insisting the apprentices do the forms perfectly, and over and over, the sorcerer gives his apprentices many chances to be \"accidentally empty\" one day, and have the Genie select what the sorcerers hid in a specific form.\n\nThe apprentice then might notice that magic happened, and be motivated to work harder to learn to empty themselves.\n\nI'm afraid the emptying goes so deep, that a beginner can't comprehend the depths of the emptiness of sorcerers.\n\nThey don't even \"notice\" reality at times.  That's a tricky word to come up.  How sorcerers become so empty, even their interaction with reality doesn't become an element for the Genie to use.\n\nLet's say the sorcerer is in a reality bubble with a box of fresh donuts on the conference table at work.\n\nIf the sorcerer \"notices\" them, and thinks \"Man, I LOVE donuts\", then his next reality bubble might contain the element of chomping down on some fresh donuts.\n\nIt's tainted his intent.\n\nSo sorcerers might see the box of donuts, but they have absolutely no reaction to it.\n\nIt's no more important than the coffee near the table with the donuts.\n\nOr the receptionist in eye's view, wearing a miniskirt.\n\nOr the hot rods zooming around the parking lot outside.\n\nThe sorcerer perceives it all. Maybe even more of it than the average person.  But he has no desires towards any of it, so as to eliminate all but what he wants from the elements the Genie might find to dictate the form of the next reality bubble.\n\nOnly absolute internal silence allows this.  Any words in the mind of the sorcerer will influence the flow of his awareness, in the current situation.  And give too much emphasis to some element of the current reality bubble.\n\nSo a sorcerer must remain silent.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Ideal Intending", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 73, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"dmlvvi2y7r991": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 56, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dmlvvi2y7r991.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=826252087e60eca71234c9bb9ac85a9bd2bb86ac"}, {"y": 113, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dmlvvi2y7r991.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e44c4c3607f6de1f860ebbde99c2fe1d6ed5cf45"}, {"y": 168, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dmlvvi2y7r991.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7264086f3223ae8f472298f6b722c6ff227cee37"}, {"y": 336, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dmlvvi2y7r991.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c203a622858462105d37e0401c5ab731471f4dd"}, {"y": 504, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dmlvvi2y7r991.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32451215e73112ede0a0d1f7a9eb3a0dcd6c23ab"}, {"y": 567, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dmlvvi2y7r991.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b027a955de8ccba8561e36c94866a987dde3f298"}], "s": {"y": 630, "x": 1200, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/dmlvvi2y7r991.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e69a4f3e8aec223579e2c2d249289a12246c0baf"}, "id": "dmlvvi2y7r991"}}, "name": "t3_vrw8ez", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 35, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 35, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wMmNyzF6obVwc7ZDqKm-_uR1oWql52JyHSSF_skJfAY.jpg", "edited": 1657031537.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1657022558.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/dmlvvi2y7r991.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e69a4f3e8aec223579e2c2d249289a12246c0baf\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/dmlvvi2y7r991.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e69a4f3e8aec223579e2c2d249289a12246c0baf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t think of a title for this which is not &amp;quot;too ambitious&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in being too ambitious, carries the opposite of what this post is supposed to convey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just so you can follow this, I&amp;#39;ll use a story.

But can&amp;#39;t reach full on SK lately.  It should be a great story, if I can become empty enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Wuwonian&amp;#39;s niece slips into a crack in an old haunted house her uncles are investigating.  They keep searching the outside walls for openings, but the niece crawls in a crack and slides along boards traveling behind the walls at all angles, until she drops right into the living room of the house, then walks over and unlocks the door for her uncles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a story about the difference between witches and male sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t have that one.  I couldn&amp;#39;t create it myself. Only Silent Knowledge could get that story right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My stories are crude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity is like that.  Each tensegrity move actually contains the makings of a &amp;quot;story&amp;quot;.  In a crude form, but the story is still in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s at a level that won&amp;#39;t get us fussed up.  Just a &amp;quot;piece&amp;quot; of meaning, without enough context to be upsetting or thrilling.  Or thought provoking even, but that&amp;#39;s dangerous waters when designing a new tensegrity pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sort of &amp;quot;dancing around the issue&amp;quot; here and about to blow it, but hopefully this will clarify it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a Genie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not evil. Not a Jin.  But also has no desire to &amp;quot;bless&amp;quot; anyone, or create any &amp;quot;happy endings&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It exists to support reality.  Like a &amp;quot;worker bee&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s never bored, never ambitious.  It has a job, and it does it.  No complaints, no regrets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This Genie&amp;#39;s job is to create reality for each human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it turns out in this Genie&amp;#39;s&amp;#39; world, reality doesn&amp;#39;t last very long.  It runs until it &amp;quot;wears out&amp;quot;, and then a person experiencing that reality will fall into blankness. Inactive, with nothing to do, nothing to perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They fall into &amp;quot;the void&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That costs the Genie&amp;#39;s boss, an Eagle, to lose money.  He&amp;#39;s on a tight schedule collecting memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one knows why the eagle wants those.  Let&amp;#39;s just assume that the Eagle isn&amp;#39;t actually the boss of the whole affair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#39;ll probably never know why the eagle is so driven. To get memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even don Juan didn&amp;#39;t know. As he said, sorcerers have no idea why the emanations create sensory data for humans, giving them the impression of a real place, with solid matter, laws of physics and such.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, there&amp;#39;s only sensory information.  No actual fixed reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s too many emanations to use them all to create a reality!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;selected&amp;quot;.  By the Genie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sensory information is then radiated to us by the effect of our awareness focusing on the selected bundles of emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a projected &amp;quot;virtual reality&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s so good we&amp;#39;ll never believe that. It &amp;quot;feels so real&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll surely never know why the Eagle (the emanations) does that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the Genie is just a worker and isn&amp;#39;t driven by anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, he has to please the Eagle.  That&amp;#39;s his one &amp;quot;issue&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he checks out something humans can&amp;#39;t.  How the eagle &amp;quot;feels&amp;quot; about something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he has a choice for which reality to build, he&amp;#39;ll tend to favor those which tickle the fancy of the eagle.  Make the eagle smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People run out their piece of reality often.  The Genie  then makes them a new reality bubble, but the clock is still ticking and it runs down quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needing the Genie to make the next one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Genie has his hands full for sure!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he encounters someone who&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;gone blank&amp;quot;, he does his best to restore a reality bubble for them as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#39;ll find out doing darkroom, he&amp;#39;s not always there in time.  We go blank often when practicing darkroom.  And it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to tell for how long.  We estimate it by noticing we didn&amp;#39;t fall over and bump our head on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But otherwise, we have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that anything bad is ever likely to happen. When people &amp;quot;go blank&amp;quot;, they&amp;#39;re safe.  They aren&amp;#39;t perceiving anything at all, so they just stand or sit there oblivious to everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And since we&amp;#39;re talking about &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot; here, nothing is going to damage them just because they aren&amp;#39;t paying attention.  The whole thing is sort of &amp;quot;shut down&amp;quot;.  Not entirely I suppose, but well enough to avoid harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I mention the Genie&amp;#39;s name is &amp;quot;Intent&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Intent finds a blanked out human.  He studies their clothes.   He studies the last reality bubble they came from.  He replays the last few seconds of it, to see if the human voiced any preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using anything at all, he tries to find a basis for the next reality bubble to give to that human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s never a problem, unless he runs into a sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers are tricky.  They&amp;#39;re on to the Genie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve learned the rules the Genie uses when searching for criteria to use in the next reality bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they can eliminate all of it.  Leaving just &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; thing for the Genie to find.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, the Genie uses EVERYTHING it can find.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll even reach back into the past to find criteria.   If the human was obsessed with something in the past, and the Genie&amp;#39;s supply of information from the present is low, it&amp;#39;ll use the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But sorcerers learned to blank out even their past, using various techniques we can&amp;#39;t afford to go into here because this story would no longer be &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot;.  It would mess up my attempts to show the &amp;quot;heart of the matter&amp;quot;, when it comes to manipulating the Genie known as &amp;quot;Intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why, but this reminds me of something humorous in the life cycle of babies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I believe it won&amp;#39;t cause anyone to get fussy, if this is mentioned in the course of this story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Babies like to be held, and will even cry if left on the carpet too long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And since they love to be held, mothers have learned amazing skills of carrying them around, nearly effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose they prop the baby against their hip when necessary, to free an arm for doing something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at some point, babies only want transportation.  Not to be carried all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they learn how to &amp;quot;get off&amp;quot;, even against the mother&amp;#39;s will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As best I can figure out, they arch their backs so that the mom has nothing to prop against her hip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or wherever she wedges them with, to prevent sliding off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only do they arch their back the wrong way, so that there&amp;#39;s nothing on their torso or butt to catch a bump on the mother and hold the baby in place, but they actually stick their arms up high, so those will slide through any grip also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They turn into a smooth rod that can&amp;#39;t be grabbed or supported on any curve or bend it has.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just learn how to &amp;quot;slip off&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what sorcerers do.  They remove anything the Genie can find, to support his next reality bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except for one single thing.  The thing they want the Genie to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that they can control Intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not as easy as it sounds!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you ever know a little kid who was pulling a prank on his mom, but couldn&amp;#39;t keep from giggling?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or looking over at the Dad to get a smile, because they were both in on the gag?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mom isn&amp;#39;t going to be fooled.  The kid just can&amp;#39;t hide his own behavioral evidence of the coming prank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, while speaking to the mom to set up the prank, the kid can barely finish a sentence without giggling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Carlos did that a few times, when wanting to tell a dirty joke in private class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He couldn&amp;#39;t get it out, without laughing first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or that seemed to be what was going on.  More likely is, he was setting us up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the ones planning it as Carlos likely did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re like that kid who can&amp;#39;t control himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some worse than others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bad players who come in here stink of the giggling child who is pranking someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone who&amp;#39;s been reading in here a while can easily spot a bad guy coming here to steal or  cause trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That person will never be able to do what sorcerers do, making themselves so empty that the Genie can&amp;#39;t find any criteria to create the next reality bubble other than what the sorcerer wants him to find.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bad players are excluded from ever seeing what sorcerers are doing, because they&amp;#39;re too fussy to find such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so without ever seeing it, even a tiny bit, there&amp;#39;s no hope for them to &amp;quot;wake up&amp;quot; and start to remove their wrong behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just give in to it, hoping to demand what they want from the Genie, using force, blackmail, threats, or self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of being like the smart baby, who knows how to turn himself into a greased glass rod with nothing for the mom to hold onto. Guaranteeing he&amp;#39;ll slip from her grip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bad player babies just cry and make a fuss, and try to annoy the mom so much she&amp;#39;ll obey their demands and set them down on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I suppose would be ok as far as this subreddit goes. Let them play in the dirt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, they insist the mother has to watch them play.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the instant she does what they want and sets them down, her day is ruined.  She has to give them 100% of her attention, or they&amp;#39;ll start crying again. If that doesn&amp;#39;t work, they throw a tantrum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Angry babies can&amp;#39;t be allowed to build up in this subreddit, or the whole quest is over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s no magic in the world. The percentage of fussy babies is too high to allow a place where people can observe and learn to do what the sorcerers do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Empty themselves, so that only one single clue remains for Intent to find when it goes to create the next reality bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I posted a long time ago how this subreddit was wondering if it was possible to use a sleeping mask, instead of a dark room, and suddenly while walking along I found a brand new sleeping mask in my path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to avoid stepping on it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t walking along thinking, &amp;quot;I should figure out where you buy sleeping masks, so I can try that out for others!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or even , &amp;quot;Man, I got to do everything?   I have to actually wear that awful thing, when I have a perfectly nice dark room?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t even remember I wanted a mask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there was some discussion in here prior to me finding one,  where I suggested I&amp;#39;d look into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And laziness had put it off until I totally forget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent did not.  For whatever reason, when it created my &amp;quot;go for a walk&amp;quot; reality bubble that day the sleeping mask element was included.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And included brilliantly!  That Genie is quite intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sleeping mask at the start of my walk would have been a burden.  Can you put sleeping masks into your pocket?  Won&amp;#39;t they bend and no longer be light tight?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I want to carefully carry the mask by it&amp;#39;s rubber band, so it wouldn&amp;#39;t get wet from my sweaty hands?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d probably be motivated to ignore it as too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My original desire was to find one somewhere, maybe at the grocery store in the sleep products section.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And just stick it in my shopping cart for later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the Genie did a very good job with the sleeping mask part of the reality bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He placed  it where I couldn&amp;#39;t possibly miss it, and only 20 feet from the door of my business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that all I had to do was pick it up, and walk back to my desk.  Set it down by my car keys, and my intent to acquire a sleeping mask was fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was an &amp;quot;accidental perfect intend&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why that worked so well, but possibly it&amp;#39;s because the Eagle smiled in such a way that Intent was guided to &amp;quot;emphasize&amp;quot; that request it found in my memory.  And do an extra good job with that one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was very poor intending on my part, but I &amp;quot;got lucky&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A real sorcerer empties everything, until there&amp;#39;s only one thing left for Intent to find.  A guaranteed reality bubble to the liking of the sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But sorcerers also have to intend things on behalf of the apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they learned how to &amp;quot;tickle the fancy&amp;quot; of the eagle.  To get him to help emphasize the elements that the Intent Genie might normally consider less important than all the other stuff the apprentice has going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose the story of Julian casting don Juan into a river to drown is a good example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;reality bubble&amp;quot; was about to expire as Julian lifted him, and started to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan had no idea what Julian was about to do.  But as usual, he suspected some cool magic was going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last thing he heard before Julian tossed him into the raging river, was Julian&amp;#39;s effort to sway the eagle towards don Juan surviving, instead of drowning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both were possible, in the new reality bubble Julian forced off on don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent,  the Genie,  still had to form that reality bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Julian boldly exclaimed, knowing the Eagle was watching, &amp;quot;For goodness sake, don&amp;#39;t hate the river!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Eagle found that amusing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while nearly drowning, don Juan&amp;#39;s double came out to rescue him and don Juan ended up &amp;quot;not hating&amp;quot; the river.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it became the ride of his life!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He learned about his double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan had all sorts of nonsense flowing around inside him at the moment the Intent Genie had to create his reality bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without the help of Julian&amp;#39;s exclamation to the Eagle, don Juan&amp;#39;s chances to survive were slim indeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he &amp;quot;inserted&amp;quot; an element into the information the Genie used to create the new reality bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;#39;t much.  But Don Juan heard what he said.  So it became part of the awareness and history of don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Genie only uses that.  From the human for which the bubble is being made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only when there&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing to go by, that the Genie will examine outside stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, we try to pick up the intent trails of the old seers.   My latest is trying to pick up the shapeshifting feeling they liked, so it is used by the affection for the energy body pass, when the form ends and the Genie creates a new reality bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We darken the room, to remove as many &amp;quot;intent influences&amp;quot; as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a pretty simple trick!  Less &amp;quot;choices&amp;quot; for the Genie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The darkness, and my ability to remove my internal dialogue, allows me to &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; the feelings of the old seers from the past, so the Genie causes that tensegrity form to shapeshift me.  At the end, when that reality bubble runs out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity creates reality bubbles.  Which guide how the Genie makes the next one when the form ends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the form, the assemblage point is drifting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the form, you get to see &amp;quot;the results&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, the results are visible all along the way if you can see energy.  But at the end of the form, there&amp;#39;s also a potential &amp;quot;result&amp;quot;.  One that will only come into being, in absolute silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Julian, being a masterful sorcerer, could completely &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; himself of any criteria the Genie might use to create the next reality bubble for Julian. Except the &amp;quot;one thing&amp;quot; Julian wanted him to find.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s what sorcerers do!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he could also &amp;quot;add that&amp;quot; to the many elements don Juan had available for the Genie to use, and Julian could add it in such a way that it made the eagle smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so when the Genie formed the bubble, and was deciding what the chances were for don Juan not to drown, he caught the Eagle smiling at the element of &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t hate the river!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the Genie said, &amp;quot;Ok boss. He won&amp;#39;t hate it.  I&amp;#39;ll see to that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s to gain from this story?  For a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is &amp;quot;The Mastery of Intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a book deal.  You can&amp;#39;t possibly learn it, if the Intent Genie finds that desire inside you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s not going to &amp;quot;judge&amp;quot; you as a bad guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might, but he won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;ll just create a reality bubble that leads you along that path too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the elements inside you which might have given you a chance to actually learn sorcery, will be buried by your greed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t learn!  If you think you can do both, you&amp;#39;re really clueless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is like drowning in the raging river.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If don Juan had been thinking how cool it would be to end up on the front of the &amp;quot;Mexico City Press&amp;quot; newspaper in the morning, as a sad drowning victim, with the story of his wonderful life also printed so that readers would feel real sorrow at his drowning, he&amp;#39;d be screwed. He&amp;#39;d drown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That &amp;quot;element&amp;quot; would have been too strong and the Intent Genie would have selected that reality bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same happens to bad players in here.  There&amp;#39;s no way they&amp;#39;re going to learn.  Because learning sorcery is not important to them.  They want attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so the Genie will create a reality bubble for them, which does not have the goal of helping them learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To learn sorcery, you have to &amp;quot;intend&amp;quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way sorcerers do.  By emptying themselves of all other goals and desires, but the single one they need the Genie to use next, to make their reality bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices can&amp;#39;t manage that, so sorcerers give them &amp;quot;techniques&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity contains some &amp;quot;intending elements&amp;quot; that the Genie will notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then by insisting the apprentices do the forms perfectly, and over and over, the sorcerer gives his apprentices many chances to be &amp;quot;accidentally empty&amp;quot; one day, and have the Genie select what the sorcerers hid in a specific form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The apprentice then might notice that magic happened, and be motivated to work harder to learn to empty themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid the emptying goes so deep, that a beginner can&amp;#39;t comprehend the depths of the emptiness of sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t even &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; reality at times.  That&amp;#39;s a tricky word to come up.  How sorcerers become so empty, even their interaction with reality doesn&amp;#39;t become an element for the Genie to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say the sorcerer is in a reality bubble with a box of fresh donuts on the conference table at work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the sorcerer &amp;quot;notices&amp;quot; them, and thinks &amp;quot;Man, I LOVE donuts&amp;quot;, then his next reality bubble might contain the element of chomping down on some fresh donuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s tainted his intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So sorcerers might see the box of donuts, but they have absolutely no reaction to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no more important than the coffee near the table with the donuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the receptionist in eye&amp;#39;s view, wearing a miniskirt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the hot rods zooming around the parking lot outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sorcerer perceives it all. Maybe even more of it than the average person.

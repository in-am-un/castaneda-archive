I guess that&amp;#39;s a male obsession.  Keeping control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you do in fact have to &amp;quot;cheat&amp;quot; if you want to see the hardcore magical stuff.  Like shapeshifting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To do that, you move the assemblage point all the way to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many in here have done it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You stay in the middle to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What many in here have a hard time with, is shifting slightly to the right while at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where the &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot; of your energy body can be formed into any object you can conceive of, and you yourself can mutate into strong beasts  or turn into insects and fly off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t mess around in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of that is the goal however.  We seek to duplicate that &amp;quot;Nagual&amp;#39;s blow&amp;quot; you see in the picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then go there every single night, where according too don Juan, &amp;quot;Real learning takes place&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You even get a new teacher from time to time, who gives you a lecture on a specific topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a lecture on &amp;quot;naked&amp;quot; last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I won&amp;#39;t repeat in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of naked anyway...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_lt7p01", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lt7p01/new_j_curve_diagram/jk8axxj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1684153488.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jk7231o", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "scot20004", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1684119997.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_lt7p01", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_b85tfnv3l", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "wow really nice stuff!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jk7231o", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;wow really nice stuff!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lt7p01/new_j_curve_diagram/jk7231o/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1684119997.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_lt7p01", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

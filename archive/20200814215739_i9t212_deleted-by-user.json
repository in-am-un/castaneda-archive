Castaneda used this word &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; as sentimental spoken jargon, as an allegory for the miraculous and indescribable something; the word &amp;quot;magician&amp;quot; he does not use at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got confused, forgetting the origin of words and concepts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The magician is the priest of the religion of Ancient Iran. From him came an occupation - magic, that is, priesthood. In Plato&amp;#39;s Dialogues, it is in this sense that he speaks of the study of magic. Later the word &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; began to denote charlatans and fortune-telling, and in the 20th century it degenerated into the designation of magicians in the circus and on shows, or became an artistic image or allegory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do not find  it correct historically, etymologically or semantically with the word &amp;quot;magician&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot;. Why is it needed? To make people laugh when they think you&amp;#39;re playing a character like Harry Potter or an illusionist in a circus? :)))&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_i9t212", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/i9t212/deleted_by_user/g1jsnuw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1597479190.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g1htk33", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "monkeyguy999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1597445162.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g1hdqv4", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_14w1ssx0", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "LOL. fall over on floor!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now you have met DAN,", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g1htk33", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOL. fall over on floor!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now you have met DAN,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_i9t212", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/i9t212/deleted_by_user/g1htk33/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1597445162.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g1norr7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g1n4mm9", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Cholita draws amazing pictures of that.\n\nShe has them riding in a ship on the river of filth.

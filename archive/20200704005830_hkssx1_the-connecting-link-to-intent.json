Yet, after I had coughed and choked a few times, my nasal passages opened and I found myself taking deep, soothing breaths. I had such a feeling of well being that I was not even annoyed at him for his blow, which had been hard as well as unexpected.\n\nThen don Juan began a most remarkable explanation. Clearly and concisely, he gave me a different and more precise definition of sorcery. I had entered into a wondrous state of awareness! I had such clarity of mind that I was able to comprehend and assimilate everything don Juan was saying. He said that in the universe there is an unmeasurable, indescribable force which sorcerers call intent, and that absolutely everything that exists in the entire cosmos is attached to intent by a connecting link. Sorcerers, or warriors, as he called them, were concerned with discussing, understanding, and employing that connecting link. They were especially concerned with cleaning it of the numbing effects brought about by the ordinary concerns of their everyday lives. Sorcery at this level could be defined as the procedure of cleaning one's connecting link to intent. \n\nDon Juan stressed that this \"cleaning procedure\" was extremely difficult to understand, or to learn to perform. Sorcerers, therefore, divided their instruction into two categories. \n\nOne was instruction for the everyday-life state of awareness, in which the cleaning process was presented in a disguised fashion. \n\nThe other was instruction for the states of heightened awareness, such as the one I was presently experiencing, in which sorcerers obtained knowledge directly from intent, without the distracting intervention of spoken language.\n\nDon Juan explained that by using heightened awareness over thousands of years of painful struggle, sorcerers had gained specific insights into intent; and that they had passed these nuggets of direct knowledge on from generation to generation to the present. He said that the task of sorcery is to take this seemingly incomprehensible knowledge and make it understandable by the standards of awareness of everyday life.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen I get home today, I'm going to complain to Fairy that she can't hit hard enough, or else I could use her to help you guys.\n\nHer strongest punch is only 2 ounces of force.  \n\nSo you're forced to get to heightened awareness on your own.\n\nTalking to your buddies isn't going to cut it.\n\nBeing impeccable is only a viable path for people who have a don Juan bringing them to heightened awareness when they aren't paying attention.\n\nNo heightened awareness, no magic.\n\nOnly talking.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Connecting Link to Intent", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_hkssx1", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1593817110.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspirational quote time.

you could appreciate.\n\nWe can't remember what goes on when the assemblage point moves too far, because there's no \"links\" to it.  Thus my thumbs up technique. When you do that to signal a really cool event you don't want to forget,  like for example big bird  just materialized on the ceiling and winked at you (I'm making fun of that Walker Texas Ranger shamanistic screeching eagle flying over head image), a lot of information gets stored with it.\n\nWhere were you in the room when you gave yourself a thumbs up?  Was your butt hurting from sitting on the coils on the edge of your bed?  Was it cold, so that raising up your arm wasn't all that pleasant because you had to remove it from under a blanket.\n\nThose are \"memory indexes\".  Like, \"Look up the computer record for when you didn't want to take your hand from under the blanket to give a thumbs up, and find all available info from that moment in time.\"\n\nThat's how the thumbs up works.  It's just an added \"database index\".\n\nBut way way out there in assemblage point movement, that doesn't work either.\n\nAnd I've been told by my inorganic beings, I'll remember it when I need it.  Until then, it's just inventory obsession.  Latent book deal mind concerns.\n\nSo what about \"the abstract\"?  How come you can't even formulate a single word to describe it, seconds after you experience it?\n\nAnd when you do experience it, it's a concrete thing at times.  Something you're looking at thinking, \"that's cooler than usual!\".  A perfectly normal thing you can \"experience\".  Even stare at a bit, although staring will move the assemblage point and make it go away.  Same as you can't stare at a dreaming phantom.\n\nWhy can't  you find even a single word to explain or describe it?  You search your memory, there it is, you can see it, but when you try to make a word to go with it, it changed already.\n\nThe memory of it changes as you try to find a word to describe it.\n\nIt can mutate in your memory.\n\nSo in fact, you could describe it.  But as you try to, it changes to another thing.\n\nSort of  similar to how a dream phantom mutates.  But the memory of a dream phantom does not.  Those are fixed.\n\nPerhaps the abstract is still, \"active\" in memory.  Being in memory doesn't file it away as unchangeable, the way it does with non-abstract things.\n\nI even interacted with an abstract object, or maybe it was a scene, because now I can't find even a word to describe it.\n\nBut at the time, I didn't realize there was anything out of the ordinary, other than it couldn't possibly be there fully lit in sunlight, in my darkroom.\n\nPerhaps, in the abstract it's always \"now\".  So it keeps doing whatever the abstract does for fun, even in your memory.\n\nAbout that double coming out.\n\nMy memory suggests it was battling a giant red caterpillar.\n\nBut now I believe, it was trying to hold back my organic matter from imposing itself on it.\n\nIt had come out, but it was in danger of being sucked back.\n\nBeginners:  Please forget all this!  If I see someone pretending it, I'll have to be more cautious about what I say over here.\n\nWe've got 3 people right this minute, willing to pretend their experiences.\n\nRapists is how I see them.  People who take what they want from others, even if it's  temporary pleasure, and don't care what happens to the person they took it from.\n\nOr at least, I wouldn't let my daughter sleep in the same room with them, if I had a daughter.\n\nWhile I'm on a bizarre analogy, beginners, please don't include me in your nightmares.\n\nEven if I could, I wouldn't visit any of you. You still suck big time.  Until you move your assemblage point to the other side, you're completely insane.\n\nYou'll have to make your own companions for that sort of thing.\n\nI'm wrong generation anyway.\n\nBut if you keep going you'll get some who will!.\n\nJust don't imagine them to get attention for yourself.\n\nYou'll end up in shared dreams for real so no need to pretend it, and have guilt over it in the future.\n\nEven Taisha said you will.  I wish someone would research that topic, of dreams with other practitioners, after you practiced for the evening.\n\nI think lecture notes is where you'd find it, not in the books.\n\nDon Juan even wanted us to pay attention to those!\n\nHe said that any dream which starts from silence, which those do because you were forcing silence to move the assemblage point, is \"real\".\n\nAlso, I saw this, this morning.\n\nYou can reach \"silent knowledge\" in dreaming.\n\nInstead of wandering around trying to figure out what's going on, or what you should do next, you get the voice of seeing helping you ought.\n\nBut don't take the \"voice\" part literally.\n\nThat's a lateral shift.

When the double puts on his Sunday finest to look real.\n\nI never thought of putting it that way, that the phantom room and the body are the same, but I did come to that conclusion also.  In a more mechanical way.\n\nMy thought is that the phantom room is just a \"film\" of the double, that you can't completely scoop off the walls, as you can  the puffs.\n\nLike a \"sheet of purple puff\" clinging to the inside of our shell.\n\nAnd so those allow you access to the double's eyes, and you get a phantom room.\n\nI'll elaborate, but this is mostly speculation.\n\nWhen you are in a phantom room you are \"inside\" the double in some odd way. He can still be there, fully visible, and even leave to go explore.\n\nBut the walls are made from him.\n\nWhen you wiggle your fingers in the air, to stimulate a little dream,  you're catching his interest.\n\nYou \"summon\" more of him to where your fingers are wiggling, and so you can have a full color little dream scene.  For beginners, phantom rooms are usually monochrome,  and rather blurry.\n\nI'll have to check that out tonight.  Does the phantom room get less clear, when you form that full color dream scene?\n\nAs if you sucked a bit too much of him off the walls, to get that concentration there?\n\nWhen you summon an entire perfect translocation, in full color, all around you, I'd like to try to figure out where you got the stuff needed to do that.

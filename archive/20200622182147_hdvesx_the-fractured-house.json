But not strong enough to cause damage.\n\nAnd so last night around 2AM, when I heard a crash so loud it sounded like Cholita had ripped a door off and slammed it on the floor, I wasn\u2019t too surprised.\n\nExcept by the intense energy I felt as a result.\n\nMy assemblage point had been jarred by the noise, and moved very far.\n\nIt was a creepy feeling, similar to the one you get when an inorganic being is present in a dream, and you first become aware of them.\n\nI tried to go back to sleep, but the intense fright and the strange sensation that an inorganic being was about to attack, made me worry that Cholita might actually break down my bedroom door.\n\nI needed to get up and see what was happening.\n\nI sat up in bed, not noticing that it wasn\u2019t actually the bed I went to sleep in. This one had light colored sheets and a blanket. My real bed has a quilt.\n\nBut I was awake, and a little fuzzy. I rolled off the bed and slid my legs to the floor, only to find that I could barely move them. They were stiff and hard to use. It reminded me of a lizard who hasn\u2019t had a chance to sun on the rock, and is too cold to crawl fast.\n\nI failed to notice that my feet barely reached the floor. I\u2019d shrunk 2 feet in height. But I was more worried about falling from being unable to move my legs fast enough, so I had a subconscious thought that it was a good thing I had in fact shrunk.\n\nI stood up and started to walk around the bed. The room was pitch black. That was odd, because when I first awoke the room was bathed in a completely even white light.\n\nI scanned my head around the dark room, trying to figure out where the bed I\u2019d awakened in had gone.\n\nI had infinite gazing power. Everywhere I glanced was something interesting to see.\n\nThat didn\u2019t surprise me. With Cholita run away I\u2019ve been able to practice 6 hours a day, perhaps the optimum amount for rapid progress.\n\nDid you hear that?  6 hours is optimum for just about any sorcery practice.  It's enough to keep your daily gains, despite the 18 hours of folly for the rest of your day.\n\nMy feet began to work better with each step. I also seemed to have grown back to my normal height.\n\nI gazed across the room, trying to figure out what was going on.\n\nThere was absolutely no sound from Cholita\u2019s room. Or even any part of the rest of the house and yard.\n\nCholita just wasn\u2019t there.\n\nI looked at the north wall, and noticed it was covered in very old roots from gigantic trees.\n\nIt was a pleasing sight. I\u2019d assembled a world on my walls, and it actually had parts of old trees growing into the room.   It was no longer flat on the wall.\n\nI could have touched those roots!\n\nOn the south wall I noticed it now stretched up hundreds of feet. It was like the inside of an ancient temple ruin that had been overgrown through the centuries. Around 50 feet up was a large window. A man was looking out from it.\n\nMy picture isn't accurate, but the roots and the general color are the same.  This temple had a very tall flat wall, like the ones in Raiders of the Arc type movies.\n\nI sensed that there were such windows all around the room, and remembered the first time Carlos deliberately attempted to see under don Juan\u2019s direction. He saw a \u201ctableau\u201d with characters in each window.\n\nThat's what I was seeing.  A tableau.\n\nIt reminded me that every part of Carlos\u2019 books is also part of a map of *intent*, and liable to repeat for us.\n\nPlease remember: *Intent* is not your spiritual intentions. Anyone speaking like that has no sorcery knowledge.  It's both internal, external, and very much aware.\n\nTurning to the left, I caught sight of the little smoke entity. I\u2019ve come to recognize some fixed form it can appear in, rather than the scary forms it took on when Carlos first lent it to his private class.\n\nIt was staring at me, hidden between some pink vertical bars of light and dark.\n\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d, I commented.\n\nThe bars slid together, blocking my view.\n\nTurning to the east, I ran into Fairy.\n\nShe was right there, in great detail, floating or standing near the east wall.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be protecting Cholita!\u201d, I commented.\n\nHer head turned left, and she frowned.\n\nI left the room to search the house and yard for Cholita, but she was not there.\n\nReturning to my bedroom, I sat up on the bed to figure out what had happened.\n\nAs best I could figure, I was asleep in a dreaming copy of my bedroom, in a dreaming copy of my house.\n\nAn inorganic being who was hanging out in the house copy had made the sound, in order to jar me out of sleep.\n\nExcept, I was laying in a dream bed, not my real one.\n\nI woke up from that dream, into my real room.\n\nExcept I was still in my dreaming body.\n\nEach step transferred me back to my \u201creal\u201d body, until everything was normal.\n\nI seem to have reversed the normal procedure of switching from waking body to dreaming body, which happens automatically if you enter a dreaming portal to another world.\n\nI had emerged from a dream, and changed into my Tonal.\n\nI had a sudden revelation.\n\nThe power spot in Carlos\u2019 house!\n\nRumors had gone out that Miles crossed it, and became trapped in the second attention. One of the witches had to go in there to bring him out.\n\nI\u2019d heard a similar story regarding Grant, but couldn\u2019t remember the details.\n\nOne thing I knew for sure, Carlos wanted me to see that beam.\n\nWhen it was well known he was dying, he invited me to his Pandora complex, I was led to that beam in the small room that connects pieces of the house, and given ample opportunity to cross behind that beam alone, while Carlos prepared half a pear to serve me.\n\nIt was a parting message.  A Chinese symbol.  Half a pear.  The master is separating from you.\n\nThinking about the beam, I seemed to recall that I\u2019d heard rumors it led to a dreaming place you could pass into.\n\nCould it have been a copy of the Pandora complex, created by having multiple sorcerers dreaming and practicing in the same house?\n\nNyei seems to imply this, in a recent interview on her dreaming practices.  She mentions dreaming together with someone in the same place, but separated in different rooms.  It encourages shared dreaming.\n\nIt makes sense. There are some odd things going on in the account of Zuleica teaching Carlos to scoop colors in darkness. In a couple of accounts he seems to wake up in a different room, one that is well lit. With someone watching him. As if he were also there all along.\n\nBut if a house can fracture like that, producing a copy in the second attention simply because sorcerers are living together there, that might mean the same has happened to Cholita and me.\n\nFor the last few days before Cholita had run away, I\u2019d found her in dreaming with Minx, running around a dream copy of our living room together. Minx pretending to be a young person.\n\nMinx!\n\nThat\u2019s who woke me up, I thought to myself.\n\nI sat up on the bed to try to sense the extra rooms. I was looking east, but the phantom bedrooms and living room were behind me. One time I\u2019d successfully entered my dreaming double and projected it there, by \"turning around\" in the dreaming body.\n\nThose of you who have done a lot of 4 gates dreaming will likely have \"turned around\" in your dreaming body, while trying to enter from waking.\n\nNyei even mentions in her dreaming interview, that sleeping on the stomach may help promote lucid dreaming.\n\nI suggest, it's better to start out on your back, and \"turn around\" only in your dreaming body.\n\nIt can be found, \"separated\", and both can be there at the same time while you lay in bed.\n\nYou \"turn around\" the dreaming one so that you can walk away, without the distraction of the first attention body's eyes.  Their forward gaze.\n\nUsing \"turning around\", I had projected my dreaming body into the living room, while still fully awake and sitting up on pillows in my own bed.\n\nAt the time I thought I was in the \u201creal\u201d living room in my dreaming body, but being unable to move I now realize, it was a copy of the living room created by Cholita. It even had some traps put there by Cholita.  Attention traps.\n\nGazing at the east wall,  trying to summon a vision of the other rooms so I could turn around and enter them,  I felt a sudden movement of my assemblage point.\n\nIt was accompanied by a flash of heat on my cheeks.  A rapid movement of the assemblage point can produce tingling, but it can also cause your face to flush.  In that case, I supposed it's a much faster movement.\n\nAfter all, you \"burn with the fire from within\" using a rapid movement of the assemblage point.\n\nJust speculation...\n\nAs a result of the heat on my face, the east wall transformed in an instant into a perfect view of sky scraper like structures, in darkness. They were spaced so far apart, they stood out as odd.\n\nTypically sky scrapers are all bunched together.\n\nIt must have been another world. Or the past. They were somewhat primitive.\n\nThe view was amazing, in all of the details.\n\nThe purple mist around me intensified, and yellow streaks started to swirl, along with jet black.\n\nThe city was gone.\n\nYou can determine the depth of the assemblage point from effects like that.  When we get more who can do it, we can try to map  it out.\n\nI spent the rest of the night trying to travel to the other bedroom.\n\nBut I kept getting into an argument about it, with a being from over there.\n\nHe wanted to come to my bedroom instead.\n\nIt required some strange negotiation as to where he was to sit, since I was already sitting on the edge of the bed.\n\nHe was concerned we couldn't both be in the same place but I couldn't understand why.\n\nI patted my hand on the bed to my right, to suggest why not just sit there?\n\nThe room started to spin, and I found myself coming out of a blank out.\n\nI realized, having a dreaming copy of your house is a great aid!\n\nJust focusing on it moves the assemblage point quickly.\n\nPlaying with colors in darkness is a great, but nothing compared to a fractured house.\n\nI realized, all sorcerers live in fractured homes.  It\u2019s inevitable.\n\nCholita's bench, to test if more than one pic is ok.\n\n[Cholita's Bench](https://preview.redd.it/nbl0xxrg2a751.jpg?width=1172&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a370971d92bb6879518c4e618e0f1cc6398213e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited five times\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Fractured House", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"nbl0xxrg2a751": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 51, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nbl0xxrg2a751.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04c1945e7a2abed69b7b31c2d4c45a4f46a86393"}, {"y": 102, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nbl0xxrg2a751.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96eb1625396fdf297b73e4e7bb64f7c95784a0c1"}, {"y": 151, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nbl0xxrg2a751.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07519b9416f317023377bfb3df4a2773a3a3e5c2"}, {"y": 302, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nbl0xxrg2a751.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd4dc6a6545b4ea8db9bd4ad693e4bddb3767597"}, {"y": 453, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nbl0xxrg2a751.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c40e2c16979fe4d54937e76ba8566de3848d896"}, {"y": 510, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nbl0xxrg2a751.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80654f3744832d81a6118266268d3dab78bb8d5b"}], "s": {"y": 554, "x": 1172, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nbl0xxrg2a751.jpg?width=1172&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a370971d92bb6879518c4e618e0f1cc6398213e"}, "id": "nbl0xxrg2a751"}, "bqdb0tsdnh651": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdb0tsdnh651.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5981312cbdd527d536fc2f6b1867c8d79c815478"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdb0tsdnh651.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9244a8a7f624da46944c6199a6e912a33aceed26"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdb0tsdnh651.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acfe35d987fa364c2c46eaa7291a5f0f29328c54"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdb0tsdnh651.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c65a8f045bdff26c9e860374da47737367e6147e"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdb0tsdnh651.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26c3f2ddf85cc22c9cf8416fd184b51dfe70a02d"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdb0tsdnh651.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5f29d38f7b8baaaf3b4dc6a4ade1fecad5993b9"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bqdb0tsdnh651.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bfa1a7e4cfd65e4bd6eaf94fb569a58a22f1140"}, "id": "bqdb0tsdnh651"}}, "name": "t3_hdvesx", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/vm7qVeDMcTffxoz4hreKMKpGh8OCDBx6tyExDJhreaQ.jpg", "edited": 1593187370.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1592842907.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bqdb0tsdnh651.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5bfa1a7e4cfd65e4bd6eaf94fb569a58a22f1140\"&gt;\\&amp;quot;Readers of Infinity\\&amp;quot; publication can explain those cities.

As if he were also there all along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if a house can fracture like that, producing a copy in the second attention simply because sorcerers are living together there, that might mean the same has happened to Cholita and me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the last few days before Cholita had run away, I\u2019d found her in dreaming with Minx, running around a dream copy of our living room together. Minx pretending to be a young person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s who woke me up, I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat up on the bed to try to sense the extra rooms. I was looking east, but the phantom bedrooms and living room were behind me. One time I\u2019d successfully entered my dreaming double and projected it there, by &amp;quot;turning around&amp;quot; in the dreaming body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those of you who have done a lot of 4 gates dreaming will likely have &amp;quot;turned around&amp;quot; in your dreaming body, while trying to enter from waking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nyei even mentions in her dreaming interview, that sleeping on the stomach may help promote lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest, it&amp;#39;s better to start out on your back, and &amp;quot;turn around&amp;quot; only in your dreaming body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can be found, &amp;quot;separated&amp;quot;, and both can be there at the same time while you lay in bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You &amp;quot;turn around&amp;quot; the dreaming one so that you can walk away, without the distraction of the first attention body&amp;#39;s eyes.  Their forward gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using &amp;quot;turning around&amp;quot;, I had projected my dreaming body into the living room, while still fully awake and sitting up on pillows in my own bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time I thought I was in the \u201creal\u201d living room in my dreaming body, but being unable to move I now realize, it was a copy of the living room created by Cholita. It even had some traps put there by Cholita.  Attention traps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gazing at the east wall,  trying to summon a vision of the other rooms so I could turn around and enter them,  I felt a sudden movement of my assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was accompanied by a flash of heat on my cheeks.  A rapid movement of the assemblage point can produce tingling, but it can also cause your face to flush.  In that case, I supposed it&amp;#39;s a much faster movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all, you &amp;quot;burn with the fire from within&amp;quot; using a rapid movement of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just speculation...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result of the heat on my face, the east wall transformed in an instant into a perfect view of sky scraper like structures, in darkness. They were spaced so far apart, they stood out as odd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typically sky scrapers are all bunched together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It must have been another world. Or the past. They were somewhat primitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The view was amazing, in all of the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The purple mist around me intensified, and yellow streaks started to swirl, along with jet black.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The city was gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can determine the depth of the assemblage point from effects like that.  When we get more who can do it, we can try to map  it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the night trying to travel to the other bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I kept getting into an argument about it, with a being from over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wanted to come to my bedroom instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It required some strange negotiation as to where he was to sit, since I was already sitting on the edge of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was concerned we couldn&amp;#39;t both be in the same place but I couldn&amp;#39;t understand why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I patted my hand on the bed to my right, to suggest why not just sit there?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room started to spin, and I found myself coming out of a blank out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, having a dreaming copy of your house is a great aid!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just focusing on it moves the assemblage point quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Playing with colors in darkness is a great, but nothing compared to a fractured house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, all sorcerers live in fractured homes.  It\u2019s inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s bench, to test if more than one pic is ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nbl0xxrg2a751.jpg?width=1172&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2a370971d92bb6879518c4e618e0f1cc6398213e\"&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s Bench&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited five times&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d442824c-6005-11ea-b1ec-0ebd57ae4429", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "hdvesx", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 36, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hdvesx/the_fractured_house/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/hdvesx/the_fractured_house/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1592842907.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fvv8wa2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fvv5qz9", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I suspect those are only in the fractured copy of the house, but I'll have to check where that sledge hammer she has hidden in the yard has gone to.

That position of the assemblage point is far away, and you have to be able to move back and forth to remember things like that.\n\nIn your own case, you\u2019re probably only remembering what you told yourself on waking, or shortly there after.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can rate the likelihood it was \u201creal\u201d.\n\nYou never dream about that person, then suddenly a bunch of it.\n\nOr if not a bunch, the dream is very vivid, and all kinds of weirdness is in there. Weirdness is always there, but you see it more clearly.\n\nThe two of you in the same place increases the strength of the intent.\n\nBut a warning:  Don\u2019t placebo yourself by thinking you\u2019re making progress, based on normal dreams.\n\nThe loss to you is too great for pretending!\n\nAs you\u2019ll see.\n\nCholita\u2019s been on a fixing binge lately, with an artistic bent.\n\nLazy she is not.\n\nShe hauled a heavy concrete yard bench through the house at 3AM, and I found it a day or two later, covered in mosaic tile.\n\nIt had a totally Mexican look to it.\n\nShe\u2019s had a couple of successes like that which are pretty obvious, so yesterday we were not enemies for the first time in as long as I can remember.\n\nBut she\u2019s a shower hog. Likes to take her shower during the time spot I have for getting ready for work.  She \"blocks\" me, when she's angrier than usual.\n\nI had to skip a shower yesterday, so this morning it was crucial I beat her into the bathroom.\n\nI\u2019d been trying to enter the dreaming copy of the house for hours, unsuccessfully.\n\nI hadn\u2019t yet realized, to enter the dreaming copy, at least with my skill level, you have to go to sleep.\n\nYou can pass from that dream back to the real world with no apparent transition. But going in seems to require sleeping.\n\nSitting up on the bed around 5AM, I could get a hint of the dream house, but I just couldn\u2019t seem to get in.\n\nI didn\u2019t know the procedure to enter. I\u2019d only done it once before, by accident.\n\nAround 6AM I decided I\u2019d better sleep a while. Cholita would take over the bathroom soon, and it\u2019s easier to wait and see if she gives it up soon enough, while you\u2019re sleeping.\n\nAround 7AM I opened my eyes, and began to suspect the power was off.  I cover all the lights in my room, but some LEDs always leak out. There was nothing, and the fan I usually keep running was silent.\n\nI got up to try the light switch, and found out the power was in fact off.\n\nCholita used to blow the power all the time, so I opened the door to my room to go see what had happened.\n\nOpening the door revealed enough sunlight streaming in, so that I could see that Fairy was laying safely on my bed.\n\nShe was particularly real looking.\n\nI should have noticed, she was animating at full speed. She wasn\u2019t a flickering image that changes only twice a second, as IOBs tend to be when you're doing waking dreaming.\n\nShe was full speed.\n\nShe sat up and smiled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go check the power\u201d, I told her.\n\nI walked into the living room. It was also very dark.\n\nI heard the sound of little claws scurrying slowly across the wooden floor. I thought to myself, Cholita always leaves the door open, and now we have a rodent of some kind.\n\nI left the living room and walked down the 2 concrete steps into Cholita\u2019s garden, just outside the door. Cholita was watering plants in the morning sunlight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t smile at me, but she wasn\u2019t crazy angry either.\n\nShe allowed me to go over to the power panel, mounted on the back wall of the house.\n\nYep, the fuse was blown.   The main fuse this time. That was  unusual.\n\nI restored it.\n\nCholita now had a shovel, and was bent over provocatively, digging a hole.\n\nShe likes to do that.  But it\u2019s ok by me!\n\nWhen I got back in the house I noticed the rodent was in fact a rather cute squirrel.  It had what looked like a big grin, and seemed to be begging for nuts.\n\nI shouted to Cholita in the back yard, \u201cWe have a squirrel in here!\u201d\n\nI headed to check the status of the bathroom. Did Cholita have clothes hanging, or could I use the shower?\n\nOn the way I ran into a boy with amazing red hair. He was like the ultimate Irish boy, very fair skin tending to blush pink, smooth full red hair, and he had on a multi color beanie like a nerd might wear at google, but with a hole in the top for his bright red hair to show.\n\n\u201cOh, I know you!\u201d, I said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Cholita\u2019s little friend. I heard of you. \u2018Baby\u2019 was it?\u201d\n\nThe creature replied, \u201cBay Bay\u201d.\n\n\u201cBebe?\u201d, I repeated.\n\nHe repeated his name again, but there was something impossible to pronounce in it.   The sound seemed to sink away, like a memory, before his voice finished.\n\nI entered the bathroom only to find, Cholita had taken a sledge hammer to the shower/bath.\n\nIt was obvious she was going to redo all the tile, and make it mosaic style as she\u2019d done with the bench.\n\nCholita showed up, and explained I could still take a shower under the vanity.\n\nI saw a little impromptu shower, as they have in Taiwan.\n\nAmericans are used to having a full shower in a bathroom, an oven huge enough to cook a big turkey, and all kinds of things you can\u2019t have in a place as crowded as a big city in Asia.\n\nShowers are typically just a hand spray hooked to an ordinary sink, with a tile floor so that you can wash off right next to the toilet.\n\nAnd then, since space is limited, there\u2019s only one per family.\n\nEnterprising grandfathers often build an even worse shower, one no woman would touch,  somewhere off in the back of a factory they own, in case they have my problem.\n\nCan\u2019t get a shower in the morning because the young women hog it.\n\nA dripping pipe on which you can hang a towel is about all those consist of.  Often it doubles as  a stainless steel trough type toilet as they have in Tijuana bars.\n\nA factory mass production toilet.\n\nCholita had rigged up one, so I couldn\u2019t complain about how long it was going to take to fix the shower.  She was standing there with a big pipe wrench in her hand, smiling.\n\nBaybay was beside her as backup, with a grin that said, \"I'm on her side!\"\n\nI returned to my bedroom to get my toothbrush and towel.\n\nI can\u2019t leave it in the bathroom, in case Cholita goes catatonic.\n\nWhen she recovers, she interprets the toothbrush as an attack (spell) and gets rid of it.\n\nFairy was still in my bedroom, and said she\u2019d need a shower soon too.\n\nCould I please hurry up?\n\nI agreed, and hurried back to the bathroom with the minimum I needed.\n\nWhile I was soaking in hot water from the shower I realized, it wasn\u2019t broken at all!\n\nIt made no sense.  The bathroom was back to normal.\n\nThe hot water washing over me slowly restored my reason.\n\nI had in fact succeeded in visiting the fractured copy of the house. I woke up in it, after obsessing on how to enter, and taking a nap.\n\nApparently, there\u2019s a near perfect copy of my bedroom over there too.\n\nAnd both Fairy and Minx like to hang out there, where they can be ultra-realistic.\n\nI have no idea how I smoothly transitioned from dreaming to waking, without waking up.\n\nAnd who was that squirrel?\n\nA week or two later Cholita and I were sitting in a hot car, waiting.   Cholita was scanning endless pictures on her cell phone.\n\nShe'd unbuttoned a couple of buttons on her blouse, and it was hard not to look.\n\nShe caught me, and I looked away.  High up in the air, running across a power wire, I saw what looked to be the same squirrel as  had been in the dream.\n\nI shouted, \"Squirrel!\"\n\nCholita didn't look up from her cellphone.\n\nEdited five times", "edited": 1596068108.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fvuzoax", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2: Squirrels Are Fun&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by answering a question many of you have, on shared dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, you probably did share a dream with your friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don\u2019t expect them to remember.

It was also very dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard the sound of little claws scurrying slowly across the wooden floor. I thought to myself, Cholita always leaves the door open, and now we have a rodent of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left the living room and walked down the 2 concrete steps into Cholita\u2019s garden, just outside the door. Cholita was watering plants in the morning sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn\u2019t smile at me, but she wasn\u2019t crazy angry either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She allowed me to go over to the power panel, mounted on the back wall of the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep, the fuse was blown.   The main fuse this time. That was  unusual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I restored it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita now had a shovel, and was bent over provocatively, digging a hole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She likes to do that.  But it\u2019s ok by me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got back in the house I noticed the rodent was in fact a rather cute squirrel.  It had what looked like a big grin, and seemed to be begging for nuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shouted to Cholita in the back yard, \u201cWe have a squirrel in here!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I headed to check the status of the bathroom. Did Cholita have clothes hanging, or could I use the shower?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the way I ran into a boy with amazing red hair. He was like the ultimate Irish boy, very fair skin tending to blush pink, smooth full red hair, and he had on a multi color beanie like a nerd might wear at google, but with a hole in the top for his bright red hair to show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh, I know you!\u201d, I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re Cholita\u2019s little friend. I heard of you. \u2018Baby\u2019 was it?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The creature replied, \u201cBay Bay\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBebe?\u201d, I repeated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He repeated his name again, but there was something impossible to pronounce in it.   The sound seemed to sink away, like a memory, before his voice finished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I entered the bathroom only to find, Cholita had taken a sledge hammer to the shower/bath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was obvious she was going to redo all the tile, and make it mosaic style as she\u2019d done with the bench.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita showed up, and explained I could still take a shower under the vanity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a little impromptu shower, as they have in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Americans are used to having a full shower in a bathroom, an oven huge enough to cook a big turkey, and all kinds of things you can\u2019t have in a place as crowded as a big city in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Showers are typically just a hand spray hooked to an ordinary sink, with a tile floor so that you can wash off right next to the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, since space is limited, there\u2019s only one per family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enterprising grandfathers often build an even worse shower, one no woman would touch,  somewhere off in the back of a factory they own, in case they have my problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can\u2019t get a shower in the morning because the young women hog it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A dripping pipe on which you can hang a towel is about all those consist of.  Often it doubles as  a stainless steel trough type toilet as they have in Tijuana bars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A factory mass production toilet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita had rigged up one, so I couldn\u2019t complain about how long it was going to take to fix the shower.  She was standing there with a big pipe wrench in her hand, smiling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Baybay was beside her as backup, with a grin that said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m on her side!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I returned to my bedroom to get my toothbrush and towel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t leave it in the bathroom, in case Cholita goes catatonic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she recovers, she interprets the toothbrush as an attack (spell) and gets rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy was still in my bedroom, and said she\u2019d need a shower soon too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could I please hurry up?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agreed, and hurried back to the bathroom with the minimum I needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I was soaking in hot water from the shower I realized, it wasn\u2019t broken at all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It made no sense.  The bathroom was back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hot water washing over me slowly restored my reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had in fact succeeded in visiting the fractured copy of the house. I woke up in it, after obsessing on how to enter, and taking a nap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently, there\u2019s a near perfect copy of my bedroom over there too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And both Fairy and Minx like to hang out there, where they can be ultra-realistic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how I smoothly transitioned from dreaming to waking, without waking up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And who was that squirrel?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A week or two later Cholita and I were sitting in a hot car, waiting.   Cholita was scanning endless pictures on her cell phone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;d unbuttoned a couple of buttons on her blouse, and it was hard not to look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She caught me, and I looked away.  High up in the air, running across a power wire, I saw what looked to be the same squirrel as  had been in the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shouted, &amp;quot;Squirrel!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita didn&amp;#39;t look up from her cellphone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited five times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hdvesx/the_fractured_house/fvuzoax/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1593013131.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_hdvesx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fvv7o4f", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1593017064.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_hdvesx", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Part 3: The visitor\n\nSomewhere this morning, while I was running around in the fractured house with Minx, Fairy, and Cholita, I had a visitor.\n\nHe was standing at the foot of my bed. \n\nI was presumably sitting up on pillows.\n\nBut when it happened I cannot figure out. \n\nMaybe at the same time as I was in the dreaming copy, since my Tonal was still in the real world.\n\nI was asking him if dreaming characters can really talk.\n\nHe was around the height of Carlos, but I took it for granted who he was.\n\nAnd didn't bother to look or ask.\n\nWe were having a conversation, that's all.\n\nYou don't stop in the middle of a long conversation, to look closely and identify who you are talking to.

It&amp;#39;s too far away!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get your face right in it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Palm is fine, if you use it like a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td1KAgrYUGA\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td1KAgrYUGA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, you aren&amp;#39;t using the flat surface of your hand as a background.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re gazing into it, to find what&amp;#39;s in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rotate it at the wrist, back and forth, an inch or two from your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do the parade wave, in your face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In silence, in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t find the strands in the hand, it means you need to summon more Cambodian villages for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/hdvesx/the_fractured_house/fvscl8r/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1592948541.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_hdvesx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fzodnk7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1596067432.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_hdvesx", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Part 4: How to make your own fractured house (maybe)\n\nHere's the theory on how this happened.\n\nCholita brought Minx home from DC.

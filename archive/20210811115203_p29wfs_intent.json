In this particular  universe there's just awareness, the emanations, and intent.\n\nBut intent is just an aspect of the emanations.\n\nSo you can certainly say, *intent* governs all of our activities.\n\nI suppose we're blind to it because we're so familiar with this place that we fully believe it's real, and the only thing that can be.\n\nHowever, intent leaks into our \"normal\" awareness.\n\nThe Chinese concept of \"luck\" is actually intent.    There are 2 sets of rules for manipulating it. One for business, and one for personal.  It's even on Wikipedia which is good, because westerners have no idea what's going on in the mind of Asians. If they did, they'd toss out the Daoism texts, and only read the parts about magic, in Buddhist texts.\n\nThe rest is pure Asian social order, and not a healthy point of view.\n\nCatholics aren't much different.  They have the idea that you can pray, and God answers prayers.  Or an angel can too.\n\nWeakened shamanism believes you can appeal to the spirit of trees, to solve specific problems.\n\nBut there's something else very interesting to me in what you wrote.\n\nYou theorize that the ritual of night time grooming, summons sleep.\n\nIn the first 4 books don Juan taught Carlos the complicated rituals to summon Devil's weed and Little smoke Allies.\n\nThey were both a LOT of work!!!\n\nAnd nonsensical.  There's no reason to grind seeds or dig for roots, if you have a normal devil's Weed plant right there.\n\nJust pick 1-5 leaves, depending on how plastered you want to get, and how much risk you are willing to take.\n\nBrew them as a tea.  Maybe with a pinch of lemon juice, to acidify it.\n\nSo why all the rituals?\n\nThat's how shamanism tends to develop.\n\nIt's like winning a baseball game in your blue socks.\n\nNext time, you wear the same blue socks hoping it will help you win.\n\nThe power plant rituals are like that.\n\nThere's no benefit at all to the procedures, except that they summon the intent of what you want.\n\nBut to intent, it's all just awareness flowing on emanations.\n\nThere aren't \"good\" or \"bad\" flows of awareness on emanations.\n\nOne pointless ritual is as good as any other pointless ritual.\n\nEven no  different perhaps.\n\nBUT, each time a ritual is done, there's some residual awareness that doesn't go away.\n\nYou end up with an \"intent path\".\n\nPossibly it's the same awareness we try to recover with recapitulation.  Fibers stuck in things, that belong to us.\n\nWhich someone else can follow because they tend to \"imply\" a certain bundling of emanations.\n\nIt's as if the pointless ritual becomes REAL, only when enough people do it to make it easy to find.\n\nTo find that trail of intent.\n\nThat is in fact, the only way to learn this sorcery.\n\nHook to the old seers and follow their intent trail.\n\nMore reason (newbies) to avoid reading \"spiritual\" books until you get to the orange zone.

In this particular  universe there&amp;#39;s just awareness, the emanations, and intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But intent is just an aspect of the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can certainly say, &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; governs all of our activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose we&amp;#39;re blind to it because we&amp;#39;re so familiar with this place that we fully believe it&amp;#39;s real, and the only thing that can be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, intent leaks into our &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Chinese concept of &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; is actually intent.    There are 2 sets of rules for manipulating it. One for business, and one for personal.  It&amp;#39;s even on Wikipedia which is good, because westerners have no idea what&amp;#39;s going on in the mind of Asians. If they did, they&amp;#39;d toss out the Daoism texts, and only read the parts about magic, in Buddhist texts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest is pure Asian social order, and not a healthy point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Catholics aren&amp;#39;t much different.  They have the idea that you can pray, and God answers prayers.  Or an angel can too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weakened shamanism believes you can appeal to the spirit of trees, to solve specific problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s something else very interesting to me in what you wrote.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You theorize that the ritual of night time grooming, summons sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the first 4 books don Juan taught Carlos the complicated rituals to summon Devil&amp;#39;s weed and Little smoke Allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were both a LOT of work!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And nonsensical.  There&amp;#39;s no reason to grind seeds or dig for roots, if you have a normal devil&amp;#39;s Weed plant right there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just pick 1-5 leaves, depending on how plastered you want to get, and how much risk you are willing to take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brew them as a tea.  Maybe with a pinch of lemon juice, to acidify it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why all the rituals?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how shamanism tends to develop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like winning a baseball game in your blue socks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time, you wear the same blue socks hoping it will help you win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The power plant rituals are like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no benefit at all to the procedures, except that they summon the intent of what you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to intent, it&amp;#39;s all just awareness flowing on emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; flows of awareness on emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One pointless ritual is as good as any other pointless ritual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even no  different perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, each time a ritual is done, there&amp;#39;s some residual awareness that doesn&amp;#39;t go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You end up with an &amp;quot;intent path&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly it&amp;#39;s the same awareness we try to recover with recapitulation.

Sort of like the ones who did that to Carlos while he was alive.\n\nI'm not sure what they were looking for.  Used condoms?  Drug needles?  Amy's Panties?\n\nOne thing's for sure, magic drives people nuts!\n\nLook at how all religions are formed by someone doing magic (a \"Prophet\", a \"Sage\", a \"Wise Man\"), and then instead of everyone saying, \"Hey, teach me that!\", they say, \"I will follow you master.  Heal me, guide me.\"\n\nIt's bizarre.  A religion is built on magic, but no one wants to do any.  That takes work!\n\nI get my butt kicked on reddit, my posts get removed, and all because I dare to suggest, your subreddit with a \"magic theme\", out to actually help people learn to do magic.\n\nAnd since it's clearly not, can I offer you advice on how to modify what you do?\n\nThe Satanism subreddit didn't appreciate me yesterday. They removed my post.\n\nFortunately, Satanists are a little slow.  \n\nWe got 10 new people in the subreddit before they came back from whatever naked ritual they were performing and removed my post.\n\nAll I was doing was telling them, there's no Lucifer.  \n\nBut if you'd like to hold a 4 inch tall copy of Satan in your hand, I could help you learn to do that by teaching you about spirits.\n\nI can't imagine why that bothered them!\n\nThe Dzogchen people were so pissed off last time I visited, I got banned for life.\n\nBy the way, the Buddha was a Putz.\n\nJust FYI.\n\nHe was not wise at all.\n\nWe have darkroom gazers more advanced than Buddha.\n\nHis techniques work poorly, his understanding was juvenile, and even worse, Buddhism is based on a series of horrible lies.\n\nNo wonder Buddhists are so angry.    They've been working so long waiting for a paycheck, and don't like someone to come tell them \"You aren't getting paid ever.  It was a nasty trick to steal your money.\"\n\nUnlike a real group of hard workers at a factory, who would simply want to know how you can be sure they'll never get paid, and would eagerly listen to a discussion of why the company can't pay them, the Buddhists start foaming at the mouth.\n\nIn other words, it's not real to them.  They don't want to do magic. They're in it for all the wrong stuff.\n\nLike rising to the top, so you can hang out with the Dali Lama.\n\nWearing the cool Zen master costume, instead of the \"lowly monk\" robe.\n\nOr having their own little subreddit so they can lord it over others, as the \"moderator\".\n\nJust wanted to say that.  It needs to be said more often to wake up, or weed out the Buddhists among us.\n\nYou'll never learn sorcery, if you are still hooked to outside stuff.\n\nTaisha once dared to say something no one is allowed to say.\n\n\"Jesus was an egomaniac.\"\n\nWhen you say that, I dare you not to look around for a lightening strike.\n\nThe current position of the assemblage point of much of humanity is protecting  the image of Jesus, and you actually have to break some kind of barrier just to utter that sentence without fear.\n\nBut I never heard Taisha say what Carlos wanted badly to say, and could not.\n\nHe didn't have access to so many people as we have in here, and had to worry about losing someone key to his attempt to build energetic mass.\n\nWe don't.  Screw the trouble makers!\n\nSo I'll say it:\n\n\"The Buddha was a Putz!\"\n\nEasy to justify by the facts and history of Buddhism.\n\nBut don't say that in Taiwan.  You might get your butt kicked.\n\nIn Thailand, you could even get killed for it.\n\nSo Techno has become a dumpster diver, and found this gem.   A hippy oriented look at Castaneda from 1973.\n\nWe also have a \"17 magazine\" on order because it contains an article on Carlos, and there are several others Techno dug up.\n\nAll going into a single place where you can look for answers.\n\nHe's already compiled all workshop notes into a  huge file.  So big, he needed to separate the other stuff he's collecting.\n\nBut DON'T go in there for gossip. \n\nFor more inventory.\n\nIt's best to only go in there when you discovered something you don't understand and need answers.\n\nConsider that each visit to the garbage receptacle, gives you a bad smell.\n\nAnd the IOBs are picky about hygiene.  It gets smelly in those tunnels!\n\nTry to keep the inventory searching to a minimum.  To only when absolutely needed.\n\nFor instance, you're struggling very hard in the darkroom and do something completely impossible.  You're gazing through a big hole in your darkroom wall at a brilliantly lit alien world, with the view of that world zooming along the ground towards some kind of unbelievable city in the distance.    You can see what looks like writing on the tall buildings, but you can't yet see it clearly enough to read any.\n\n(From the Blue Scout's experience.)\n\nJust a few more seconds and you'll be close enough!\n\nBut there's a huge drop of sweat running down your forehead. And you know for sure if it runs down your nose and tickles it,  you'll sneeze.\n\nAnd that will be the end of your magic for that night. It takes a lot of energy to do that.  You won't have enough to start over.\n\nA  hand reaches out from the right, and wipes the drip from your forehead using a red rag.\n\nThat's when you might want to go dumpster diving for answers!  Who was that?!  Do I remember a red rag from the books???\n\nJust stay away from the used condoms as you dive deep into the dumpster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Outside Resources", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"4yaocfehynq71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 146, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4yaocfehynq71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea60fab89e9a84f3bcd5abb14fd7c6c39032879b"}, {"y": 293, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4yaocfehynq71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=431d73a12865414c6318f1d56f3eb1e4075f109c"}, {"y": 435, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4yaocfehynq71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86ea99aa8b669ff9f04c6ddf597fddcf44f1e91d"}, {"y": 870, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4yaocfehynq71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef8f7a71aecaf9b22400bf2457ddc97ad944fb0a"}], "s": {"y": 1147, "x": 843, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4yaocfehynq71.png?width=843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=319665604bbad5731fd5735157aa2f43ca227bb7"}, "id": "4yaocfehynq71"}}, "name": "t3_pyn2z3", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Hfinwslb7q1-2lbHvh5mOIlWgKnRVrCJPAJc_Iof_bo.jpg", "edited": 1633019986.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1633018466.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4yaocfehynq71.png?width=843&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=319665604bbad5731fd5735157aa2f43ca227bb7\"&gt;Techno&amp;#39;s latest \\&amp;quot;find\\&amp;quot;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks like 23 years after Carlos died, we&amp;#39;re turning into trash can searchers.

Until you understand the book deal mind, by reading all the horrible schemes people bring in here, you probably can't \"feel\" that permanent enlightenment is merely book deal mind.\n\nAnd \"Zen Masters\" fall prey to it!\n\nThey even resort to bullying to hide that fact.\n\n\\&gt;Is the position of those who study under Carlos that we exist on this earth only once?\n\nWe don't have a position. \n\nA sorcerer gets to see what's going on.  There's no theories, unless the theory comes after the experience, to help understand it.\n\nNo techniques either!  No techniques, no theories I always say.\n\nOk... I just made that up.\n\nI've only done the \"cyclic\" being thing twice that I was aware of.  But it can happen and be mistaken for something else.\n\nBut Carlos became obsessed with it.  To the point that his teacher had to tell him to cut it out.\n\nWe have 600 copies of ourselves, living different lives, all at the same time!\n\nYou can learn to switch to a new one each night if you like.  \n\nAnd even remain there for days.\n\n2 weeks even.  But I suggest when you do it, keep it to 3 hours max.  You don't know if there's a time differential.  Those can be trouble.\n\n3 hours seems about long enough to get slightly bored with a new alien planet.\n\nAll of the sorcerers in our group have done this.   I've done it.\n\nThe group before us did it, going all the way back 10,000 years.\n\nIt predates any belief in re-incarnation, which by the way, is pretty weak in historical accounts.\n\nNot a solid \"thing\" if you go back and investigate.   It wasn't widely accepted, until it became profitable to sell religion in foreign cities.\n\nAnd you can see how finding yourself as someone else,  not understanding what's going on, would make a good \"past life\" story.\n\nSo which is it?  Past life, or \"cyclic being\".\n\nThe problem with thinking it's a past life is, the people who advocate that can't see cyclic beings.\n\nAnd if you quiz them, their stories about past lives they've seen are very weak.\n\nTheir meditation skills weak also.  They're inept!\n\nThey certainly don't experience enough to draw any conclusions.\n\nWhereas sorcerers can give you intimate details of  their visits to cyclic beings.\n\nAn analogy:\n\nA man is telling you how wonderful Disneyland is.\n\nBut as he tells you the story, it's very weak. It's pretty clear he's actually never been there.  No particulars about rides, lines, food, landscape.\n\nEverything he tells you could be in a single brochure he picked up at the car rental place.\n\nSomeone who's been to Disneyland many times instantly realizes, the guy is lying.\n\nThere's only one overall reality.  Only one form of magic that humans have discovered.\n\nEveryone is  using the same techniques, because those are all that work.\n\nBut some don't understand their techniques well.  So the techniques don't work very well.\n\nThat's what happened to the Castaneda community.\n\nEveryone fixated on the laziest things they could, such as \"being impeccable\".\n\nThey avoided those that take hard work, and are unpleasant.  Like forcing yourself silent.\n\nSo the entire community failed to learn any magic at all.\n\nFor 21 years since Carlos died.\n\nAll this subreddit does is point out which techniques need the emphasizing, and which ought to be forgotten for a while, because they had a bad effect on Castaneda fans.\n\nIf we had that much trouble finding and keeping magic, how come you don't hear about that in other \"systems\"?\n\nBecause they never found the magic!  They're like this community, 4 years ago.\n\nNo one in the Castaneda community would have agreed everyone failed. I used to get attacked for even suggesting there was no one out there, doing real sorcery.\n\nAfter all the pictures and posts in here, I don't get attacked for saying that anymore.\n\nSo, WHERE IS THAT in another system?  Especially the ones who believe in re-incarnation?\n\nJust one web address?

Until you understand the book deal mind, by reading all the horrible schemes people bring in here, you probably can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; that permanent enlightenment is merely book deal mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;Zen Masters&amp;quot; fall prey to it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They even resort to bullying to hide that fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Is the position of those who study under Carlos that we exist on this earth only once?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have a position. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sorcerer gets to see what&amp;#39;s going on.  There&amp;#39;s no theories, unless the theory comes after the experience, to help understand it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No techniques either!  No techniques, no theories I always say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok... I just made that up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only done the &amp;quot;cyclic&amp;quot; being thing twice that I was aware of.  But it can happen and be mistaken for something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos became obsessed with it.  To the point that his teacher had to tell him to cut it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have 600 copies of ourselves, living different lives, all at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can learn to switch to a new one each night if you like.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even remain there for days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 weeks even.  But I suggest when you do it, keep it to 3 hours max.  You don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s a time differential.  Those can be trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 hours seems about long enough to get slightly bored with a new alien planet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the sorcerers in our group have done this.   I&amp;#39;ve done it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The group before us did it, going all the way back 10,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It predates any belief in re-incarnation, which by the way, is pretty weak in historical accounts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a solid &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; if you go back and investigate.   It wasn&amp;#39;t widely accepted, until it became profitable to sell religion in foreign cities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can see how finding yourself as someone else,  not understanding what&amp;#39;s going on, would make a good &amp;quot;past life&amp;quot; story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So which is it?  Past life, or &amp;quot;cyclic being&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with thinking it&amp;#39;s a past life is, the people who advocate that can&amp;#39;t see cyclic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you quiz them, their stories about past lives they&amp;#39;ve seen are very weak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their meditation skills weak also.  They&amp;#39;re inept!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They certainly don&amp;#39;t experience enough to draw any conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whereas sorcerers can give you intimate details of  their visits to cyclic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An analogy:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A man is telling you how wonderful Disneyland is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as he tells you the story, it&amp;#39;s very weak. It&amp;#39;s pretty clear he&amp;#39;s actually never been there.  No particulars about rides, lines, food, landscape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything he tells you could be in a single brochure he picked up at the car rental place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone who&amp;#39;s been to Disneyland many times instantly realizes, the guy is lying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s only one overall reality.  Only one form of magic that humans have discovered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone is  using the same techniques, because those are all that work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But some don&amp;#39;t understand their techniques well.  So the techniques don&amp;#39;t work very well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what happened to the Castaneda community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone fixated on the laziest things they could, such as &amp;quot;being impeccable&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They avoided those that take hard work, and are unpleasant.  Like forcing yourself silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the entire community failed to learn any magic at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For 21 years since Carlos died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All this subreddit does is point out which techniques need the emphasizing, and which ought to be forgotten for a while, because they had a bad effect on Castaneda fans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we had that much trouble finding and keeping magic, how come you don&amp;#39;t hear about that in other &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they never found the magic!  They&amp;#39;re like this community, 4 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one in the Castaneda community would have agreed everyone failed. I used to get attacked for even suggesting there was no one out there, doing real sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all the pictures and posts in here, I don&amp;#39;t get attacked for saying that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, WHERE IS THAT in another system?  Especially the ones who believe in re-incarnation?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just one web address?  Where real people are learning what&amp;#39;s hard to believe and it&amp;#39;s not just a profit motivated single person or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s common sense.

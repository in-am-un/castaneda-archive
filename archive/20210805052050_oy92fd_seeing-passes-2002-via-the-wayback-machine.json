the archived page:\n\n\"one guy from our group met about month ago young woman, who had been aware of seeing human energetic structure and cocoons since age of nine. she is involved into hindu tradition and have power of healing with eyes. some points are significant: she is not interested in money, she takes her ability like something pushed on her without asking her. she said to our fellow, that she would like to live like ordinary people. that she'd like to have boyfriend, but when she met some attractive young man, she \\*sees\\* them and everything is ruined...\n\n...and then he did some passes. first passes were last two of video one. after doing those he asked her to describe what did she saw. she said that this was amazing.  \nthat she haven't never before seen such a radical and fast changes with cocoon.  \nfirst luminous egg was deformed into form of cone pointing towards earth. she said that from her experience she knows that this change of cocoon means applying for something.  \nafter that smaller changes take place, but in one moment cone of cocoon was pointed upwards. and after that a very strange thing happened -- cocoon was compressed into very flat something in the level of lower disc. \n\nnext thing was 'preparing intent' first part. after that he stopped and asked her again to describe what happened. she look at him and said: 'listen, this is weird again. in this time nothing happened with your cocoon. nothing. but in around you all energetic anomalies were milled into dust.' she said that this state of energetic dust is something shamans try to generate before beginning with healing or other rituals. this is disinfecting of place. i must add that in that moment she knew nothing about our tradition.\n\nok, then our fellow decided that he goes on up to the end of this series without stopping any more. \r after that her description was not so detailed. all she said is that during those passes cocoon was drastically moulded like a dough. big changes took place.\n\nok, then our fellow decided that he goes on up to the end of this series without stopping any more. \rafter that her description was not so detailed. all she said is

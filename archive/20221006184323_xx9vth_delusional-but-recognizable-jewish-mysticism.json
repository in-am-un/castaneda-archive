Abulafia creatively combined Maimonides\u2019 Guide of the Perplexed and the ancient Sefer Yesira \u00a0into an integrated method of concentrating on the Divine Name that opens the path to fulfilling the soul\u2019s deepest spiritual longings.\n\nIntense practice of Abulafia\u2019s meditative techniques propels the attentive soul into a state of awakened receptivity where the active divine influence can reach down to meet and illuminate the human intellect.\n\nAbulafia was unique amongst Jewish mystics in providing precise instructions for personal spiritual practice. I have translated meditations from three of Abulafia\u2019s major mystical handbooks \u201cthat reveal the true knowledge of the Divine Name\u201d \u00a0as he puts it. These particular texts achieved a wide underground circulation amongst Jewish mystic elites despite a severe rabbinical ban on Abulafia promulgated by Shlomo ben Adret.\n\nAbulafia\u2019s Life of the World to Come \u00a0(extant in more manuscript copies that the Zohar!) is quoted verbatim in Yehuda Albotini\u2019s Sulam HaAliya.\n\nAbulafia\u2019s Book of Desire \u00a0is quoted in the fourth, censored part of Chaim Vital\u2019s Shaarei Kedusha.\n\nSelections from Abulafia\u2019s Light of the Intellect \u00a0were printed in MosheCordovero\u2019s Pardes Rimonim.\n\nAbulafia\u2019s meditations have intrinsic moral prerequisites that guard against their misuse.

\"Inner\", Mouna : \"Silence\") is not famous because it's easy to practice on your own and it doesn't need a guru/ceremony . and it doesn't make money so ... . and the blue line people only notice the sex part of Tantra and they either get attracted or repelled by it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n.Antar Mouna is a mini Recap that cleans your mind enough to start practicing silence . depends on you but for example you can practice each step for 30 minutes in order . or whatever you like i don't know .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n( i'm a beginner and i'm not in a place to approve or disapprove this method )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAntar Mouna has five steps :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1- Awareness of Sense Perceptions\n\n2- Observation of Spontaneous Thoughts\n\n3- Conscious Creation and Disposal of Thoughts\n\n4- Awareness and Disposal of Spontaneous Thoughts\n\n5- Thoughtlessness\n\n6- Awareness of Psychic Symbols\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1- Awareness of Sense Perceptionsthis\n\nincrease the ability to be \"aware\" . pick a sense ( usually hearing is chosen ) . and try to notice and be aware of every sound you hear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2- Observation of Spontaneous Thoughtsbecause\n\nif you don't even know when you are thinking , you can't stop it .try to notice and be aware of every thought that you have . don't get entangled . just notice and watch\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n.3- Conscious Creation and Disposal of Thoughts\n\nthis is where Recap begins. pick a subject or object or person or anything , hold it's thought , and see what spontaneous thoughts it attracts . it's like a bait to attract hidden unconscious junk to come up . or it's like a request to a \"search engine\" . hold the thought and let related thoughts come and go . and then after a while release it and pick thought of another subject/object/person as a bait . don't get entangled with the thoughts that come up .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4- Awareness and Disposal of Spontaneous Thoughts\n\nit's like the step 3 , but instead of you choosing a subject , wait for a spontaneous thought to come and hold it as a bait and see what it attracts . after a while release it and wait for another spontaneous thought to use as a bait .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5- Thoughtlessness\n\nnow your mind is clean enough to force silence. say \"i don't want to think about anything\" and force silence .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6- Awareness of Psychic Symbols\n\ni have no idea what this is :D\n\n.", "edited": 1665077749.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_irb061c", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0,

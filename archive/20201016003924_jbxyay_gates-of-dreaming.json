That's an \"intent gift\".  Without those it really sucks.\n\nHere's a report from a talented future witch:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI will start by listing different unusual stuffs which has happened to me during this week: A very visible rainbow has appeared on the dark background all of a sudden. All colors in place, just hues are a bit distorted. Some spinning square has appeared, which was spinning (like a square shaped hatch), he appeared out of a color (puff), was in cold blueish colors. Strange floating shapes, resembling a skeleton of some unknown animal with white hand or something similar. This skeleton had a black colored spine. Space flickering has transformed into such a view like it is a huge living city or something like that. All this was ever moving, flickering, amazingly beautiful! A big face, appearing from time to time to the left of the center, with open mouth. First times it was like a lifeless skull, but later on became for human. It's visibility time was reducing if I have started looking at it directly. Maybe, my inner dialogue has activised then. If I don't pay attention to it, it became more visible. And in general, colors started to light up and figures started emerging, more lit, it makes colors more 3D. Several tricks which seems to help me: Maybe, I have already told it, but I am trying to gaze as if I was looking with closed eyes. I just entrain myself, that my eyes are closed and nothing special is happening. It is easier with way for the mind! Especially when you feel some fear like it was for me in the beginning. My main enemy is the dialogue - it keeps coming back as soon as I see something new which I am not used to. And this exercise helps me to calm it down, because I am more used to see something unusual with my closed eyes, so brain is easily tricked this way to calm down and I can sustain my silence longer. Colors became very bright and lit due to this trick specifically. Also, a very big violet spot has appeared, of a different hue. And I reacted strangely to it - became very tense, my focus of sight has started changing in some unknown way. Contrast, brightness has started shifting, the room became lit, then very dark, then again. And there was a feeling that I am on the verge of something big to happen.. Unfortunately, at this very moment my dialogue has interrupted, and all vanished. Also, very frequent sleeping paralyses have started to appear.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nAbout the sleep paralysis:  It turns out that Zuleica's technique contains the *intent* to change over to the dreaming double.  But we aren't pushed into heightened awareness before doing it, because we don't have a Nagual leader, the way Carlos did.\n\nBy moving our assemblage point painfully slowly towards heightened awareness, we seem to get our dreaming double interested, and it comes around to stand right next to us.    Carlos gave a few lectures about that effect.\n\nIt watches. And when we need to do something the physical body can't do, it swaps out.\n\nI'm not the only one who walks through the bed room walls while practicing.\n\nSo, we're switching back and forth naturally, instead of in the dramatic fashion Carlos did, when he completed his finger wiggling.\n\nFrankly, if we don't give up, we're better off than Carlos and group!\n\nIt's 100% ours.

Without those it really sucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a report from a talented future witch:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;****&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will start by listing different unusual stuffs which has happened to me during this week: A very visible rainbow has appeared on the dark background all of a sudden. All colors in place, just hues are a bit distorted. Some spinning square has appeared, which was spinning (like a square shaped hatch), he appeared out of a color (puff), was in cold blueish colors. Strange floating shapes, resembling a skeleton of some unknown animal with white hand or something similar. This skeleton had a black colored spine. Space flickering has transformed into such a view like it is a huge living city or something like that. All this was ever moving, flickering, amazingly beautiful! A big face, appearing from time to time to the left of the center, with open mouth. First times it was like a lifeless skull, but later on became for human. It&amp;#39;s visibility time was reducing if I have started looking at it directly. Maybe, my inner dialogue has activised then. If I don&amp;#39;t pay attention to it, it became more visible. And in general, colors started to light up and figures started emerging, more lit, it makes colors more 3D. Several tricks which seems to help me: Maybe, I have already told it, but I am trying to gaze as if I was looking with closed eyes. I just entrain myself, that my eyes are closed and nothing special is happening. It is easier with way for the mind! Especially when you feel some fear like it was for me in the beginning. My main enemy is the dialogue - it keeps coming back as soon as I see something new which I am not used to. And this exercise helps me to calm it down, because I am more used to see something unusual with my closed eyes, so brain is easily tricked this way to calm down and I can sustain my silence longer. Colors became very bright and lit due to this trick specifically. Also, a very big violet spot has appeared, of a different hue. And I reacted strangely to it - became very tense, my focus of sight has started changing in some unknown way. Contrast, brightness has started shifting, the room became lit, then very dark, then again. And there was a feeling that I am on the verge of something big to happen.. Unfortunately, at this very moment my dialogue has interrupted, and all vanished. Also, very frequent sleeping paralyses have started to appear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;****&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About the sleep paralysis:  It turns out that Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique contains the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; to change over to the dreaming double.  But we aren&amp;#39;t pushed into heightened awareness before doing it, because we don&amp;#39;t have a Nagual leader, the way Carlos did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By moving our assemblage point painfully slowly towards heightened awareness, we seem to get our dreaming double interested, and it comes around to stand right next to us.    Carlos gave a few lectures about that effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It watches. And when we need to do something the physical body can&amp;#39;t do, it swaps out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not the only one who walks through the bed room walls while practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, we&amp;#39;re switching back and forth naturally, instead of in the dramatic fashion Carlos did, when he completed his finger wiggling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, if we don&amp;#39;t give up, we&amp;#39;re better off than Carlos and group!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 100% ours.  Not given by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_jbxyay", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jbxyay/gates_of_dreaming/g90ge6d/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1602863415.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1602863415.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g8yfrt0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Vivid_Knowledge5421", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g8yeex1", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_61vuxc9q", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Shit.

Except you are never fully yourself. You're always a bit drunken, and liable to forget what you were doing any second.\n\nIt's why you try to find your hands.

According to Carlos, the slice is around 2-4 inches thick, and you can move left and right in your &amp;quot;man&amp;#39;s band&amp;quot; slice only that much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s enough to contain 1800 worlds!  (Crude estimate from other information he gave).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it veers right or left, who we are changes a lot.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 4 gates dreaming it ends up wherever you get lucid.  Except you are never fully yourself. You&amp;#39;re always a bit drunken, and liable to forget what you were doing any second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why you try to find your hands. To (hopefully) move it more back towards the middle of the band.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you learn to move it directly from waking, you also learn the fine points of what happens when it moves.  Something you can&amp;#39;t easily learn in sleeping dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You learn control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you soon learn that you can pass directly into 4 gates style dreaming, except that there&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;barrier&amp;quot; there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A barrier of forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can pass from waking dreaming into 4 gates dreaming on demand, except I always forget what I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s because the assemblage point shifts right too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sleeping dreaming always has that issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides, look around. Where&amp;#39;s the people who learned actual sorcery by that method?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also a lucid dreaming forum, where someone can kick any of our butts, when it comes to lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they aren&amp;#39;t sorcerers.  They don&amp;#39;t even believe waking dreaming is possible over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of what  you said is dangerously like Felix. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Felix was in private classes, teamed up with Corey and me.  Carlos offered to sell us Pandora, his home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was obvious from the start, Felix wanted a book deal. He was obsessed with other people, not with learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when Carlos died, being no longer of any use to Felix,  he denounced Carlos, claimed to be just like Reni (the approved teacher), and told everyone they should follow him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;quot;As long as you have the same intent, it&amp;#39;s all good, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miguel the russian translator could quote that better, but it was disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;An unbending intent to NOT FOOL OURSELVES&amp;quot; is the same as the understanding of Felix.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a good 8 people in here now who could explain why that&amp;#39;s nothing to do with intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You learn what intent is by watching objects manifest, and worlds assemble while you are awake, watching it happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent is not your intentions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forget other people, that&amp;#39;s the key to sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forget the guru visits.

To escape it, with a dream change.\n\nWhich extends the time you have left to be rational in the dream.\n\nEach zoom gains you twice as much time as you just had, and it keeps growing as you zoom multiple times.  So you can end up in a single 4 gates dream for hours.\n\nBut again, a dream of flying is NOT sorcery.\n\nSo unless you found your hands, flying through the air is NOT \"zooming\".\n\nZooming is a gazing technique, practiced inside the dream.\n\nAlthough you can later learn to do it awake, such as sitting on one mountain, and sending your double to a peak on a different mountain nearby.\n\nThe zooming has to be done so consciously you even look at your hands again in the middle of traveling,  to help keep your rationality intact.\n\nAfter messing around with the scout hundreds of times, including learning to dissolve other phantoms to identify which is the scout in a little crowd, and learning to both hold the dream longer than 20 seconds, especially with \"dream changes\",  you will eventually be taken to his world.\n\nWhere he'll teach you about dreaming.\n\nBut don't expect it to be a tidy office building.\n\nThe dreaming emissary world is bizarre, and mostly created for your own benefit.\n\nAfter your scout teaches you what I estimate to be a minimum of 100 nights, from what Carlos wrote, you can make it to the 3rd gate.\n\nThe third is not done asleep.\n\nYou go into dreaming directly from awake.\n\nThus the \"twin positions\". You lay down forcing silence in one of those positions, go directly into sleeping dreaming without actually falling asleep, and then lay down in the dream and go to sleep there.\n\nThat requires perfect silence, so really sleeping dreaming is a HARDER path than darkroom.\n\nCarlos verified that unless you can get perfectly silent, you can't pass the third gate.\n\nIt's in a bookstore lecture note Techno compiled.\n\nThe big problem here is that with sleeping dreaming you can pretend any dream is success. And you don't have to set aside any real time.  So people gravitate to it.\n\nAnd share their fake results in discussion groups, where the intelligent among them begin to believe sorcery is made up.   So that even those with enough sense not to misdescribe ordinary dreams as sorcery, are still harmed by it. Because they wonder why should they work hard, when the whole thing is just pretending.\n\nThat's why the Allies of Carlos created darkroom.\n\nTo put a stop to the pretending that nearly destroyed our community.\n\nA few months ago I ran into the youtube channel of a Russian guy who manages the Moscow tensegrity page.\n\nHe's been in here, but seems a tiny bit ambivalent.  Because he has his own \"franchise\" going on.  And this doesn't make it look good.\n\nHe had an interview with the man who married Gabriel from private classes.  Long since ditched by Gabriel. She just needed citizenship.\n\nCholita and Gabriel were friends.\n\nThe man was pretending his sleeping dreams gave him sorcery knowledge.  So he was being interviewed as someone who was \"succeeding\" at sorcery.\n\nAnd that official in the Russian tensegrity community was supporting that idea.\n\nI kind of lost hope for Russia at that point. \n\nThey don't want to learn at all.\n\nThey like their pretending too much.\n\nSomeone told me, and I tend to believe it, that in countries where wages are a lot lower than here, the income from deceiving just a few people and stealing money from them with fake sorcery lessons is significant.", "edited": 1697630895.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_k5e2iq6", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I mean I found my hands and followed the steps from Art of Dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you aren&amp;#39;t aware enough to find your hands at the start, and look from object to object, it&amp;#39;s just an ordinary dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No hands, no 4 gates dreaming success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be careful of &amp;quot;dreaming&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People use it to pretend, and never actually do any work to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos didn&amp;#39;t tolerate that at all.

I'll repeat it again, but now knowing it's deadly serious, and not silly:\n\n\"The *Intent* of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico.\"\n\nTHAT'S what we need.  Only that.\n\nNot Miguel's intent.  Not Armando's intent.  Not Ken's intent.\n\nThat ancient intent, from the only Nagual in our path (Carlos), and only that intent.\n\nKeep in mind, Carlos was so obsessed with creating links to intent, he even named the Chacmools accordingly. \n\nMaybe my obsession with intent is from Carlos, in private classes. Because no one else seems to be familiar with that topic, in the Castaneda community.\n\nIt seems strange to them at first, to worry about something as silly as reading a quote from Victor Sanchez.\n\nCarlos even made up \"myths\" about new people brought into the group, myths sort of related to the storyline.  He'd connect new people to objects in the Mexico City museum, to places, and to historical figures in his lineage.\n\nHe created the Chacmools as a \"doorway\" to the king, just as they were in the past.\n\nHe'd also hook them to new myths he had to create, to follow the rule.\n\nSuch as claiming one of the women snapped a picture of a flier, when she clearly had not.  He needed a worthy opponent for a group, so it was in line with *intent*.\n\nBy agreeing to that role, she strengthened her own link to intent.\n\nAnd as we've seen, by posting personal experiences in this subreddit people get intent gifts in return.\n\nCarlos  got criticized for \"making up sorcery connections for people who didn't have them\" after he was dead, but in fact he was simply trying to hook us to the old sorcerer's *intent*.  To their discoveries.\n\nHe was trying to give the inner circle people all the help they could get.\n\nAnd for non-inner circle, he recommended to change their name, as an alternate link to intent.  Such as Corey Donovan, or Felix Wolf.\n\nNever told me to do that though.  I got to use my real name, which is good because there's a clean historical record. When someone insists I couldn't have been in private classes, I just tell them to check the internet. It's easy to find.\n\nBut it wasn't enough to help his inner circle.\n\nThose people had a very weak link to intent as evidenced by not progressing all these years.\n\nAnd as Juan said yesterday, it's almost all gone.  \n\nMight even be too late to rescue his teachings,  since they're far too hard to do without that link to intent.\n\nWhen it's gone, it's probably over.\n\nI probably got lucky in that I always obeyed whatever Carlos told us to do. \n\nIt's because I'm Autistic.\n\nRules is all we have.   \n\nSo I got help from intent every 6 months or so, since he died.  If I was feeling like it was all nonsense, Little Smoke would show up and scare the shit out of me.  And do something amazing at the same time.\n\nDevil's Weed helped too, but he's really weird.

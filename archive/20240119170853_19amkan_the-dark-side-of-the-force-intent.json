Greed, envy, self-importance, and ultimately self-pity. And because of it, some choose to take the easy path of pretending to have magic, when they have none at all.\n\nThose people only seek human attention and money.\n\nBut why does this repeat over and over again, in our very long history?\n\nWhy did the old seers have conflicts to the point that they cannibalized others?\n\nWhy did that conflict continue, when they were forced to flee the Olmec empire and move to others such as the Toltecs?\n\nWhy did the endless conflicts continue even after the old seers became the \"new\" seers, hiding out in lineages and learning the art of stalking in order to protect themselves from outside attackers?\n\nAnd why did Carlos come under constant attack, when the task of passing on sorcery knowledge fell into his hands?\n\nWhy after Carlos was gone, do students of his who got the magic to actually work, come under endless attack?\n\nBeats me. I was only asking.\n\nBut it sounds a lot like \"The Rule\" in his book, \"The Eagle's Gift\" where the past repeats in the life of every apprentice, that repetition being taught as \"abstract cores\".\n\nIt also reminds me of how you can see ANYTHING that has ever happened to humans, anywhere, past, present, or future. Using Silent Knowledge (\"seeing\").\n\nThat happens because events leave trails in the dark sea of awareness, and in perfect silence you can reactivate those events, and even travel back in time to relive them as if you were there in person. I mean, REALLY you can. And you will, if you put in real work and sustain that action.\n\nI suppose those past events can also travel into our modern times, and cause the same things to repeat?\n\nJust be aware of it. Real magic comes under attack.\n\nIt's the fake stuff that barely gets even a criticism.\n\nNo one wants to criticize your delusional beliefs, for fear their own will be attacked next. Self-pity and greed rules the world of pretend magic.\n\nBut the real thing comes under attack from all sides.\n\nDon't let it drag you down. It might even simply be \"the flier's mind\" at work.\n\nCarlos warned us about this in private classes, saying that as soon as you built up \"energetic momentum\" when teaching sorcery, the \"Fliers\" would send an average of 3 people to attack you.\n\nTo try to destroy your progress.\n\nAnd they did. Over and over again.\n\nIf the attacks had not happened, Carlos might still have lived another 20 years. Completing his task of passing on this knowledge.\n\nBut because of the difficulty of protecting your sorcery group from outside invaders, he didn't have enough energetic mass to \"jump grooves\" when he developed liver cancer.\n\nWhich by the way, has not been proven to be a bad thing.\n\nCarlos found a path to immortality beyond \"the 3rd attention\". Which is hardly immortality. It's not a whole lot better than hiding out with the inorganic beings in their world.\n\nWith \"the third attention\" as your path, you merely end up hiding out in the earth's luminous shell and will inevitably perish when our sun expands in 5 billion years.\n\nThe path Carlos found is true immortality.\n\nAnd he might have found it, due to his illness.\n\nAt least, that's my theory.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Dark Side of The Force (Intent)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"q8n0qmdcbfdc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q8n0qmdcbfdc1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76fbf7d38fe29b0c7a451d753b78f33eaa695d51"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q8n0qmdcbfdc1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16e4fda19dd1171193bd002f3f8b36dc80953120"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q8n0qmdcbfdc1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd806eb8474854a05600413a6787e978d820e05a"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q8n0qmdcbfdc1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5e7f3b0f4179d7c9b44a65fa530b073f3364b84"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q8n0qmdcbfdc1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e913830679a513492b531d85147a2464103f948d"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q8n0qmdcbfdc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f71f1bef28b0a70187321b07753eac20df9c6b2"}], "s": {"y": 3592, "x": 3592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q8n0qmdcbfdc1.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f2bd776a57b72a06e058a0c7dfabf1c29d665ec"}, "id": "q8n0qmdcbfdc1"}}, "name": "t3_19amkan", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/RVyHo7K5a0hzObZqCCUg_GF2wh5pMOe2KdD1J_Sj3cs.jpg", "edited": 1705682157.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1705680533.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q8n0qmdcbfdc1.jpg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3f2bd776a57b72a06e058a0c7dfabf1c29d665ec\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/q8n0qmdcbfdc1.jpg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3f2bd776a57b72a06e058a0c7dfabf1c29d665ec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;dark side&amp;quot; to sorcery.

We move along that path daily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can easily go live in the IOB world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll get offers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, people too concerned with Immortality will never reach it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to be motivated by being a &amp;quot;magic nerd&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you won&amp;#39;t put in the work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We already have a horrible Eastern Bloc crowd who has turned all this into a church, under &amp;quot;Saint Reni&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve been taught all they have to do is tensegrity and recap, believe in evil flier spirits as if they were Christian &amp;quot;demons&amp;quot;, and then because of your &amp;quot;faith&amp;quot; Carlos will be waiting for them at the pearly gates of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except it&amp;#39;s a pearly bridge to the giant dome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But like I said, people with that as their concern will never put in actual work to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But most won&amp;#39;t anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might not be any connection between immortality being your main concern, and being too lazy to do any actual work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see if we get someone who can reach Silent Knowledge, and actually cares about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos told us to find SK, so that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Athina gave me an excellent quote on Silent Knowledge today, which I hadn&amp;#39;t read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It deserves an entire post, but I don&amp;#39;t have time for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_19amkan", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/19amkan/the_dark_side_of_the_force_intent/kj82lty/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1706032036.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kj7r8rw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Repulsive_Ad7301", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1706028149.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_19amkan", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_gdnlikfq", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "What was the nature of the path to immortality that he found?

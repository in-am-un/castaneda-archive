I had been traveling for 6 months and came home for a month, I had nothing to do during this time so I figured I would give this recapitulation thing a try, and so I met the first petty tyrants- the people of my memories. This included my past friends, coworkers, bosses and relatives. I didn\u2019t realize this at the time but almost everyone we meet in our lives are petty tyrants, its just that some have way more power over us than others. \n\nThe second set of petty tyrants I met were when I started traveling again. I went to a ranch to \u201cvolunteer\u201d for some time because I figured since my room and board and food were covered and all I had to do was work for 4 hours a day on various projects, that it would give me plenty of time to focus on recap, tensegrity and darkroom. This proved to be true for some time. This set of petty tyrants were the pettiest and most indulgent \u201cbosses\u201d it was the old couple who owned the ranch. All they did was eat sugary snacks and have sex with each other so they had virtually no energy to run a ranch thus everything they did was spur of the moment and low quality. \n\nI found myself getting in arguments with them over the \u201cright\u201d way of doing things. And most of these petty things were a hill that they would die on since they were \u201csmart\u201d and had college degrees. After a while of arguing, messing up my silence, and recapping the situations I realized I didn\u2019t have to be \u201cright\u201d all the time. Who cares if I\u2019m working in the most inefficient way? What I do during that time is literally irrelevant, the only thing that matters is having energy left over in the day to practice. Once I stopped arguing with them I had waaaay more energy left in the day and my silence got better. Also they were nicer to me and let me get away with being lazzy because I let them feel superior.\n\nThe third set of petty tyrants I came across in my journey were what I call the \u201chippy intellectuals\u201d. I was volunteering at what you could call small communes full of \u201cfree thinking\u201d and \u201crebellious\u201d types of younger adults. This set was dubious because it played into my ego and for the first time in my life I was getting what I wanted which was attention for being \u201cmysterious\u201d especially from females. I think I\u2019m the 3rd type of person that Don Juan described, the type that likes to come across as mysterious but in reality has nothing going on. But anyways, the more I practiced the more I found myself trying to explain these things to the hippy intellectuals. They would chew up everything I said and spit it out into this vague esoteric framework, and if I called them out on it they would get indignant and we would get into a petty argument. So again, why am I arguing with these people? Whats my intent? I had to smoke out that counter intent of wanting attention for being \u201cspiritual\u201d. Because what that amounts to is everyone just jacking each other off intellectually, and if your constantly jacking off your brain for everything its worth, you won\u2019t have any energy left over to practice. \n\nThe fourth set which is what I\u2019m dealing with now is money. Money is the biggest petty tyrant because it traps your intent, thats how society works, they capture your intent with money because people put their heart and soul into a job when they want to do it vs when they\u2019re forced to do it. This is one I\u2019m still dealing with, the best I can do is take it one day at a time. Try to make money during the day and then practice at night. I don\u2019t really have much to say about this one except that its only been beneficial to worry less about money. I seem to find it when i actually need it so as long as I have a practice space and decent food ill be able to get better. \n\nI hope this post isnt redundant and maybe sheds some light on things for other beginners out there.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Using petty tyrants to smoke out counter intent", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Flyers (counter intent)"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_10y7yyv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_rkgy103u", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Flyers (counter intent)", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1675980962.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hi, I wanted to share my experience with petty tyrants with the goal that hopefully someone will be helped by it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first petty tyrants I encountered on my journey were in hindsight.

My *intent* is to contribute to preserving something precious, the accumulated knowledge of Carlos Castaneda.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the mid 90s, Carlos told us the story of how he\u2019d written a \u201chow to\u201d book.  He said it was left in a theater by accident, and lost. He took that as an omen not to write it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut a year before he died, people in his classes started being privy to things not written before, or at least not emphasized.  As it turned out, they had received advanced copies of parts of his last 3 books.  Those were his \u201chow to\u201d book, recreated as 3.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe difference between his earlier books and those was a matter of emphasis. In his earlier books, you had to dig though the stories to find techniques. And there seemed to be so many.  Which to emphasize?  His last 3 books tell you what to emphasize.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo that end, he created \u201cthe wall\u201d, which is a beginner\u2019s game of *intent*. It teaches how to *see* energy by activating the second attention while awake, with the eyes opened.   It teaches what *intent* is, because you get to *see* to what extraordinary level *intent* fills in the missing details of perception. It also provides access to *dreaming* without all the effort.  In fact, you could say that once you learn it, *dreaming* will come to you.  You won\u2019t have to pursue it.  Even better, the dividing line between being asleep and dreaming and being awake with the second attention activated, becomes very blurry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took me 50 years to learn this, starting from the very first time I ran into Carlos at Morongo.  Not to say that along the way there wasn\u2019t plenty of other interesting stuff.  But this marks a turning point. If you learn to *see* energy as filaments, bundles, and bands of emanations, you won\u2019t be drowning in doubt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere\u2019s the steps:  First, practice recapitulation and dreaming until you have the gist of both.  In the recapitulation, you reduce the impact of emotional memories.  You\u2019ll need that to curtail the internal dialogue.  Recapitulation also enhances dreaming, because you\u2019re practicing focusing your attention on something imaginary, to make it more real.  Dreaming teaches you what it feels like when the assemblage point moves, how to hold it in position, how to change dreams, and you get your first encounters with inorganic beings.  Yes, some of those phantoms are actually inorganic beings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat\u2019s the setup, it\u2019s not part of the 3 weeks.  But if you haven\u2019t done that, the 3 weeks will be a lot rougher.  And hopefully before you try this, you\u2019ve had some experience with shutting off the internal dialogue.   If you ask, \u201cHow can I shut off my thinking? I\u2019d fall over and be unable to do my job.\u201d, then you need to practice it first, until you realize, that petty internal dialogue is only a bully, a foreign installation.  We weren\u2019t born with it and it didn\u2019t completely take over until around age 12.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeditation is good experience for shutting off the internal dialogue. Every form of meditation I\u2019ve studied works by altering the internal dialogue.  It\u2019s just done in a more friendly and comfortable way than doing it directly, probably because people teaching meditation would have no students if they advocated what I\u2019m about to tell you. They\u2019d go out of business.  Thus, almost no one is teaching this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou start by \u201ccurtailing\u201d your internal dialogue, all day long.  Every time you remember, shut it off.  And fight hard to remember constantly.  If you forget for more than a half hour, you aren\u2019t trying hard enough.   And hopefully there won\u2019t be too many half hour lapses.    If there are persistent thoughts, recapitulate them on the spot.  Turn the head, do the breath, do your best to eliminate that barrier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn day 1 it\u2019s **excruciating** and you\u2019ll try to convince yourself it\u2019s impossible.  On day 2 you\u2019ll forget less often, but it\u2019ll still be horrible.  On day 3, it\u2019ll be awful but no longer horrible.  On day 4, you\u2019ll be thinking, maybe it\u2019s sort of \u201clovely\u201d.   By day 5, it\u2019ll be almost easy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGo for a walk while doing it.  If you\u2019ve attained super hearing, super sight, super smell, and super touch, you\u2019re doing it right.  It should be noticeable.  It\u2019s caused by the lack of filtering between your senses, and your perception.  Of course, nothing really has increased, but you\u2019ve stopped ignoring most of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you\u2019re ready. Go buy some aluminum duct table, some painters blue tape, and some cardboard boxes.  Cover your windows, seal the edges with blue tape, cover over all the LEDs on electronics in the room with aluminum tape, and generally make the room so dark that you can\u2019t move around without touching furniture.  You want it so dark that you will actually become disoriented, when you start to *see* energy. Some leaks, such as a barely noticeable edge of light from the window, can be useful for landmarks, once you start walking around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was the \u201ceasy\u201d part. Now it gets harder. If you\u2019re married, chances are you can\u2019t do this.   You need to find 3 extra hours at night, when it\u2019s dark outside, for practicing \u201clooking for colors\u201d.  I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s best done after waking up in the middle of the night, because your assemblage point is looser from sleeping and dreaming.  And you can be absolutely sure, if you practice curtailing your internal dialogue all day long, your dreams will get very long, and very episodic.  You\u2019ll also start to have guest appearances in your dreams, of characters you vaguely remember.   Curtailing the internal dialogue is the absolute best way to \u201csave energy\u201d, something Carlos emphasized daily in his classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut you could do it at the start of bedtime too.  Sit up on the bed (I prefer cross-legged with pillows behind and below me for support) and stare at the darkness with your eyes open, looking for colors.  To save you some time, yes those are the colors. Those vague things you feel stupid for thinking are what you\u2019re after, because they\u2019re probably just how the eye works, or defects, or maybe age-related issues?   Those are them!  Keep watching, and they\u2019ll get brighter and brighter, over the next few days of practice.  When you start to see not only vague puffs, but also vague twisted lines , get up and walk around. Look for more on the floor, on the walls, anywhere you can think to look for them.  Don\u2019t worry if they are not \u201cdirectional\u201d.  They might only appear where your head and eyes are looking, but you can be sure you\u2019ll eventually find some that are stuck to one spot and look absolutely real, like you forgot to cover an LED on electronics on the floor.  Once you can *see* them as you walk around, try some very simple tensegrity moves.  Mashing energy is easy to see. It actually works, although the amount that gets mashed is kind of pathetic.  That\u2019s probably why Carlos said you could do them hundreds of times if you wanted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou need 3 hours for this practice, so that your eyes get very used to the dark.  You\u2019re employing your \u201csuper sight\u201d here, and it works even better when it adjusts fully to the dark.  After looking around a bit, go back to the bed and try to scoop up some of the colors. Mostly I see a nearly grey blue puffs, with occasional other colors.   You\u2019ll find that your hand can gather it and deposit it on your body,  pour it down your face (as in the tensegrity move),  or just move it around. It\u2019s even possible to gather up a puff, blow into it to make it brighter, and get it to float off.  In one class Carlos tried to show this to us, but no one seems to have gotten it.  Carlos realized we thought he'd gone nuts and was embarassing himself, and he gave us a big grin, saying, \"No????\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon\u2019t be worried if you don\u2019t see what I just described. Everyone is different.  What you\u2019re doing is learning to activate the second attention with your eyes open.   That\u2019s when it becomes possible to see the purple clouds Carlos described, which are part of Patanjali\u2019s lights.  I see all of Patanjali\u2019s colors, including the brilliant blue pearl.   I used to wach them on the ceiling when I was 5 years old. When I asked my mother, she convinced me to stop doing that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you get to see the purple cloud, with twisting and intermixing absolute black, and with red and orange on the edges, you\u2019re talented!  It's a lot harder to see when you're grown, than at 5 years old. Pat yourself on the back.  In fact, give yourself a big thumbs up right then and there, and anytime you see that purple cloud.  I also recommend saying \u201chello\u201d to the first hypnogogic phantom you see each night.   You\u2019ll need them to get some of the effects of \u201cthe wall\u201d.  I\u2019m afraid, it\u2019s possible that Carlos\u2019 sorcery needs inorganic beings to function properly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to \u201cthe wall\u201d.  The wall is an effect of the second attention, so you can\u2019t make any rules about what it looks like.  While doing stalking and practicing silence in Asia, I once saw the wall for 2 weeks straight, every time I closed my eyes.    It looked like bad wall papering from the 1970s.  But more common is for the vague lights and colors you see in darkness to sit flat on a virtual surface.  A flat surface forms in front of you, perhaps 6 to 10 feet away, and although there may be a real wall behind it, it doesn\u2019t correspond to any actual thing.  If you look up, you could see it on the ceiling. If you look down, you\u2019ll see it on the bed.  Try to touch it.  You\u2019ll see, it\u2019s in front of the actual surface there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you\u2019re seeing the wall.  Don\u2019t forget that you had to FORCE silence during all of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what can you do with the wall?  Plenty!  More later.

You fall into it if the assemblage point movement is large enough, and if you haven\u2019t somehow accumulated either the practice, or perhaps the energy, not to remain blanked out for long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat you do is this: You dare thoughts to come.  You\u2019ve reached a pretty decent level of \u201ccurtailing the internal dialogue\u201d at this point, so if there are any stray spoken thoughts, they should be rare enough that you can \u201cpounce\u201d on them.    When one comes, you focus your attention on the trail it left, from where it originated. You\u2019re trying to see the source.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you can\u2019t, there might be a need for more recapitulating.  But that\u2019s ok.  With this level of silence, at the very least you\u2019ll bounce back and forth between quick dreams or mini-blackouts, and staring at the dark with your eyes open.  The first time you try it in fact, you\u2019ll likely continuously forget to keep it up, because of shifts in the assemblage point that make you blank out or get absorbed by the context of a dream world you\u2019re perceiving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou need to keep your purpose to accomplish this.  And what you\u2019ll see if you succeed, is your externally imposed sense of self.  Carlos said it was \u201ca foreign installation\u201d, and he also called it the \u201chuman form\u201d.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI call it what your mother did to you as a baby.  She forced your attention to focus on what she wanted.  You became obsessed with the rewards and punishments of doing or not doing that, until you created a \u201cvirtual person\u201d in your head.  That virtual person imagines itself at odds with the world, and continuously tries to do something about it, with ineffective obsessions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis virtual person corresponds to real structures in the brain discovered by scientists.  And so, it\u2019s a real thing in the world of causality.   But the obsession of it isn\u2019t necessary.  It\u2019s supposed to be an aid, not a prison guard.  I liken it to a drug addict trying to produce tiny feelings of happiness, in the absense of his drug of choice,  by thinking about pleasant things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever view you find of it, perhaps a frightened child, maybe someone complaining how they\u2019ve gotten a raw deal, or even a full vision of God, the view itself is what you need. Doesn\u2019t matter what it is, as long as it\u2019s concrete enough to visualize.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember that it comes with its own \u201cintent\u201d, which is the intent of all the people around you.  It\u2019s a rather sturdy and concrete affair, not something you can easily remove.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, we don\u2019t try to remove it at this point.   We\u2019re trying to slip around it by forcing an even deeper level of silence.  You have to stop or bypass not just the spoken voice, but what\u2019s motivating it to speak in the first place.  It\u2019ll likely be seen as your attention focusing on worries and grievances.   Scenes without words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose are what gives rise to the words, the same way the voice of seeing analyzes second attention visions, and explains them to you.  Your voice of seeing has been hijacked and is clinging to self-soothing messages, from an endless flow of images.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can\u2019t tell you what you\u2019ll see while slipping past that, because it\u2019s still a blank for me.  I\u2019ll be trying to find a way to suppress it, and then I\u2019ll be gone.  Nowhere.  When I notice that, I\u2019m looking at something extraordinary.  It\u2019s a universe filled with bright yellow lines, as if the world were on fire.  But I\u2019ve never seen the transition.  I merely notice that I\u2019ve been looking at it for a few seconds or so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this level of silence, you\u2019re in a \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d sort of mode.  You have no reaction to anything you see.  It all just is. But shortly you\u2019ll notice it a bit more consciously, and likely you\u2019ll be interested in something in particular, something you\u2019ve wondered about before.  Such as, if those are Carlos\u2019 luminous fibers, do they really stretch into infinity?  If you consider that, you\u2019ll start to see the spaces between them.  They aren\u2019t homogenous.  Some are closer together, and running the same direction.  Under a group of those, there\u2019s empty space.  And yet, the whole thing is glowing with the same yellow color.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe act of noticing the spaces causes our awareness to focus on the parts that are not spaces, and the emanations themselves have the ability to reflect our awareness back to us.  Giving them the energy of awareness causes them to make a presentation, to offer you something.  They seem to want to be discovered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey might bundle up and present themselves in the form of a more solid structure.  The bundle is a package deal, a whole world you can enter.  It seems as if a group of them has some association because of vicinity, and in that group there are so many of them that they can give a complete view of a place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust noticing the bundle, which might look like a frozen patch of fire coming towards you, will cause you to feel that world.  You\u2019ll get a fast and confusing vision of being there, actually living there, with full knowledge of the context and history up to that instant.  If you\u2019re lucky, you can bounce back to view the flame, instead of getting lost in that new world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you enter the world instead, you can remain there for much, much longer than in standard dreaming.  You\u2019ll be lucid the whole time, although you can certainly start to go along with the new world, and forget your purpose.  Experienced dreamers know about going with the flow.  In the kind of dreaming you get randomly at night, going with the flow typically leads to losing lucidity.   In the worlds accessible from inner silence, you can go with the flow for a very long time, without losing lucidity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven a few weeks.   While time normally moves the same in standard dreaming, as it does here, there are some levels of dreaming where time moves much faster than it does here.  If I had to guess, I\u2019d say you\u2019ve bypassed the normal \u201cArt of Dreaming\u201d steps, and gone straight to one of the deeper levels of dreaming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter you do this, pieces of bright straight fibers of light will mix in with your vision of vague colors in the darkness.  You can make use of this. Learn to scoop the vague clouds, and pay close attention to your hands, looking for other colors.  Red in particular for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut you can try out your new understanding of how to further suppress the internal dialogue, on any object you see. You\u2019ll then be able to \u201csee\u201d specific things.  There\u2019s an odd sound that goes along with the assemblage point moving to where you can see the fibers.  I\u2019m at a loss to describe it, but it\u2019s like the sound of intensity, whatever that might be.  It might even be the sound of the \u201cwind that can blow your life away\u201d, mentioned in one of Carlos\u2019 books.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis mix of bright fibers of light, with the real-world view, can create the familiar images on the cover art of Carlos\u2019 books.  For example, a normal body with a head made out of light.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter you can do this, you\u2019ll also have access to double beings in the world.  They\u2019re out there.   I figure one in 500.  But they don\u2019t know it.  The women have so much energy, they form little gangs with friends who like the fallout.  The men end up being leaders because people sense their energy and join in their pursuit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere\u2019s probably nothing you can do about them, except notice their oddity.  The oddity of it is that if you encounter one, and get too close, they\u2019ll propel you into this type of seeing where the emanations are mixed with the ordinary view.  Just don\u2019t expect not to be completely confused when it happens.  In sorcery, there aren\u2019t many \u201cfreebies\u201d. You have to work like a dog to make anything happen.  Except if you encounter a double being.  The results of that are one of the freebies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve pursued 3 of them in my life, 2 females and one male. It came to no use in the end, the same way It came to no use for Carlos.  But it did give me an understanding of how seriously sorcerers take passing on their knowledge.  I spent years chasing them, some including very complex stalking schemes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "edited": 1548792028.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_efadmvx", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who\u2019s practiced dreaming is familiar with this blankness.

Just seeing the vague colors in the dark is enough to do it.  You are simply going to increase your level of silence, by turning your second attention, now activated, in on itself.   It\u2019s a tool for intending.  Intending fills in missing details.  If you turn it inside, you have a tool to visualize the source of the internal dialogue, so you can work more directly on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIncreasing silence levels is also how you learn to turn the jagged and distorted vague fibers of light you can see in the dark, commonly almost fully grey in color, into brilliant straight yellow fibers exuding awareness.  If you succeed in doing this next step, seeing energy as it flows in the universe, your dull vague colors in the dark will start to include nice straight, brilliant yellow fibers.  It\u2019s rather surprising, if you got used to the vague colors.  Having them combined in this manner, lets you look at things with your eyes, and find the hidden filaments inside.  You can also learn to see your own \u201cenergy level\u201d, meaning, whether its still stuck down at your toes, or has risen a little.  When it gets above your ankles, fun stuff starts to happen\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t have enough information from people who write to me to predict the colors you may see.  Perhaps you\u2019ll see amber or orange instead of yellow.  Maybe the colors you\u2019ll see for the vaguer stuff won\u2019t match mine either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The most important thing in my opinion, is to \u201cjump\u201d, not the colors or how things look.  Besides \u201csaving energy\u201d, Carlos emphasized \u201cjumping\u201d more than anything else in class.  Everything he taught there was an invitation to jump.   He once told us to walk to San Diego, from Santa Monica.  No one would do it. They all had obligations.  And in the next class, when we inquired as to what reward we\u2019d get if we did it, he withdrew the invitation. He said it was too late now, meaning, we didn\u2019t jump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo jump, you have to make the decision on your own, to play with it.  Don\u2019t treat it as if there\u2019s something wrong or it\u2019s not enough, or not what you expected. If you have inner silence, whatever you do will eventually lead to a movement of the assemblage point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor newbies, you can practice feeling the assemblage point move with meditation. Instead of following the instructions of whoever taught you, which often include ignoring \u201cside states and visions\u201d (gurus don\u2019t like trouble makers), you should pay attention to anything at all, and try to get more of it.  Odd feelings, the sense that your thoughts have moved down, blanking out, fast visions, seeing glowing light, a very noticeable change in breathing, or anything out of the ordinary, is a movement of the assemblage point.  Deliberately try to get more of that, and forget about seeing the \u201cGolden Buddha\u201d, or whatever your meditation technique teaches.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou\u2019ll need this knowledge for the next part, because there\u2019s a wall of blankness between seeing the wall with your eyes open, and seeing energy flow in the universe, where you have no reference to tell if you even still have eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_efad6o3", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point you\u2019re ready to learn to see past \u201cthe wall\u201d.

It's too hard to get all of them.)\n\nNow that you can see the wall, what can you do with it?\n\nFirst, don\u2019t expect it to stick around forever.  You\u2019re dealing with the second attention here, and it\u2019ll morph and change, and you\u2019ll learn to go past it.  If you get a spectacular result one night, keep doing it every night.  Don\u2019t let the human form talk you out of it.  You\u2019re in a battle with that very thing.  Also, you\u2019re using borrowed energy to see it.  Similar to how you can tell someone about dreaming, they find their hands the first night, but never again.  I told you about it, so don\u2019t waste the chance by stopping after a few successes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe wall is the second attention activated with our eyes open.  This means that while you can see it, you\u2019re seeing with the second attention, merged with the first attention.  Note: resist the temptation to do all this with your eyes closed.  It\u2019s certainly possible, but it\u2019ll leave you in doubt for obvious reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn class, Carlos would entice us by \u201creading off the wall\u201d to give lectures.  It\u2019s been a long time, so I don\u2019t remember those lectures in any detail.  But it was not uncommon for Carlos to give specific personal advice in lectures, about things he shouldn\u2019t have known.   And he\u2019d look the person he was talking to right in the eye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReading off the wall will likely occur as follows.  Imposed on the wall, possibly to the upper right, will be a little \u201cwhorl\u201d.  You\u2019ll know it when you see it; the word \u201cwhorl\u201d comes right to mind.  Text forms there, in the center of that.  Don\u2019t be surprised if it uses different fonts!  I once saw the font they use for Coca-Cola in Thailand.  It was so fancy, I forgot to read the words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCarlos explained this in class by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re readers!\u201d  What he meant was, we stare at text so often, our second attention has easy access to that imagery.   I\u2019d add, today we\u2019re smart phone users.  I would expect younger people to see a desktop with \u201capps\u201d, and not just a wall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you get an \u201capp\u201d landscape, the visual ones of scenes you can look into are dreaming worlds you can access.  You don\u2019t need any instructions on how to access those.  Your body will know when you can go in.  I once jumped right off the bed and into another world.  I never did figure out if I actually jumped, which would be a very dangerous thing to do in a dark room.  It was distinguishable from the kind of dreaming you do while asleep, because it was absolutely stable, and I remained lucid in it for 3 hours.  I only left because it was almost time to go to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut little dreaming scenes superimposed on the wall aren\u2019t always for entry.   Remember, you\u2019re forcing silence during all of this. But deep down at the base, below the internal dialogue, the human form is constantly visualizing scenes.  There\u2019s an endless flow of them, even without speech.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you were preoccupied with something during the day, those scenes will reflect traces of your concerns.  They\u2019ll form some kind of order on the wall, each scene animated like a mini-dream.  But all so vague, you can\u2019t really identify any one of them.  If you\u2019re lucky enough to get a guest appearance by an inorganic being, they can cause them to circulate and recombine, to produce an answer to your concern.  This is seeing, to get answers.  When the answer is ready, your internal dialog shows its true function. It\u2019s the voice of seeing.  It\u2019s been hiding behind all the petty chatter of your internal dialogue.  It\u2019ll sum the whole issue up in a simple phrase, and you\u2019ll have your answer.  As Carlos wrote, it\u2019s not something you shouldn\u2019t have known on your own.   You had all the pieces.   But it\u2019s a lot more fun to figure it out visually, and its far better at re-combining things than you can be in your normal state of consciousness.  I suspect, chances are you probably would not have figured that out on your own.  The point is, it\u2019s not supernatural information.  You had it all along.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis method of seeing the wall is done in the dark and it would be pretty difficult to do it during the day, in full light.   Fortunately, you don\u2019t have to.  There\u2019s a thing called, \u201cheightened awareness\u201d, which puts the wall at your beckon call, anytime you close your eyes.  You get to heightened awareness with silence, trauma, illness, or by any method that creates a longer lasting shift of your assemblage point, to where the second attention is activated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I had to describe heightened awareness, it\u2019s sort of like that annoying confidence cocaine users get.  Or like someone who\u2019s gone manic and thinks they can do anything.  The difference is, there\u2019s no crash from it, and it can last for weeks.  It\u2019s a self-induced mania of sorts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn heightened awareness, everything about sorcery is obvious.  You can think of the most far-fetched thing you\u2019d like to accomplish, and you can see a direct path to it.   I won\u2019t say that the direct path you see actually makes any sense.  But it\u2019s like the first time you become fluent in another language, and no longer have to think before you start a sentence.  You just \u201cknow\u201d that you can handle the words as you go along.  It\u2019s the same with heightened awareness.  You feel like you\u2019re fluent in manipulating the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, you have to have someone else in heightened awareness to fully understand it, and those are very hard to come by.  You're likely going to be stuck with what you can use it for when on your own.  Its best feature is seeing through the wall.  If you see the wall when you close your eyes, you\u2019re in luck.  Now you can see in the daylight, just by closing your eyes when needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the best places to practice this is with a bench situated where people walk by continuously.  A bench next to an airport people conveyor is perfect.   The people just glide by.  Close your eyes, look through the wall, and see the energy of the people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was curious about Carlos\u2019 claim of \u201cworms\u201d of energy in people as a result of sex.  Sure enough, they were there.  But I got a big surprise when I tried this in Bangkok airport.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the boxer rebellion in China, the Daoist sorcerers believed they were invulnerable to bullets.  Unfortunately, they were wrong. A massacre of Chinese sorcerers was the result.  If you go back in history, you\u2019ll find such kill-offs of sorcerers are not uncommon, just as Carlos warned in his books.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sorcerers from China fled to Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Thailand. The largest concentration is in Thailand.   If you\u2019re in the Bangkok airport, chances are there\u2019s some sorcerers there too.  They might be dressed as Nepalese or Thai monks, but sorcerers they are anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you\u2019re seeing people\u2019s energy this way, and one goes by, they might say, \u201cHello\u201d.  You won\u2019t ever forget it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe wall however, is just a launching point.  To \u201csee energy as it flows in the universe\u201d, you have to get past the wall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "edited": 1548706147.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ef759u4", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(From now on, I won&amp;#39;t put &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; in italics.

They might be dressed as Nepalese or Thai monks, but sorcerers they are anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re seeing people\u2019s energy this way, and one goes by, they might say, \u201cHello\u201d.  You won\u2019t ever forget it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The wall however, is just a launching point.  To \u201csee energy as it flows in the universe\u201d, you have to get past the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null,

For years without fail.\n\nBut even that isn't enough to reach Silent Knowledge.\n\nIt really all boils down to completely eliminating the internal dialogue.\n\nOnce you \"seem\" to have gotten rid of it, you  then realize you never actually did.\n\nNot even for a minute!\n\nDespite making it all the way to the deep orange zone.\n\nSo we're lucky that there's a \"good enough\" level that's nowhere near completely getting rid of it.\n\nWhat I meant was, if you are doing \"the right way of walking\" or some mutation of it, you NEED to see some magic.\n\nIf that's your only technique.\n\nOr you aren't doing it right.\n\nThat could just be a little \"weird\" sparkle.\n\nBut usually you might doze off for a half a second, and have a tiny little dream scene in your mind.\n\nI'll give an example.\n\nI like to walk around my business park, and gaze down a little ahead of my feet, at the asphalt.\n\nIt's a uniform surface, moving along as I walk.\n\nI look for \"eye junk\".\n\nA piece of plant fiber dust perhaps.\n\nIf I can find a little \"dot\" or \"worm\" down there as I slightly cross my eyes walking along, the eye junk seems to be flying above the asphalt.\n\nIt creates the illusion of a real tiny little \"thing\" flying along.\n\nIf I get completely silent, it'll turn into something!\n\nLast time, it was a little man riding in a hot air balloon.\n\nBut just for an instant!\n\nOutdoor gazing is not my thing, so I can't give you better examples.\n\nHowever if you gaze at leaves, at the shadows and light coming through a fern plant for example, your eyes might cross slightly and combine the wrong part of the fern, with some other part.\n\nBecause the shapes can seem to be the same one, with your eyes slightly crossed.\n\nAnd you can end up creating a sensation of depth there, on a \"real\" object, which is not there at all.\n\nThe same can happen if you are looking through a chain link fence, and have the wrong triangulation angle on your eyes.\n\nSo that you merge unrelated parts of the fence with another, through each eye.\n\nOnce that happens it \"puzzles\" the mind, because the depth of the 3D feeling is off, and the second attention can come out to help.\n\nYour dreaming copy comes to help!\n\nYou're trying to lure your double out, so that you can borrow his eyes.\n\nIt likes that kind of thing!  Or in fact, it likes anytime you aren't fussing and feeling sorry for yourself.\n\nWhich is what the internal dialogue is.\n\nOnce you interrupt all that self-pity, \"the double\" might come around and overlap with you.\n\nAnd you can end up seeing something weird.\n\nOn ferns, maybe some highly colorful triangle attached to a circle.\n\nSomething not there, but which your dreaming attention created while trying to explain what's going on with your real sight.\n\nBut if the assemblage point  drifts, just about anything can appear there.\n\nNow, if you are doing \"all day\" silence it's not possible to keep that kind of concentration up.\n\nBut any effort to get silent will help out later, when you can do it alone with privacy.\n\nYou can't \"earn\" sorcery by \"doing your chores\".\n\nIt's only attained with creativity and hard work.\n\nEastern Meditation systems try to convince people \"it's only a matter of time\", even if that takes 3 lifetimes. Just meditate twice a day, perhaps for 20 minutes, and they claim that'll transform you.\n\nThey lie!\n\nAnd there's no second chances. One life is all we get.  So the idea that it might take more than one lifetime, is totally obscene.\n\nBut  they have people meditating daily for 10 years before they realize they were lied to and it doesn't actually work as promised.\n\nBy then they've weeded out serious people, and all that's left are the attention seekers who want their own franchise, and are willing to call \"bliss\" and minor visions during meditation, mostly caused by dozing off, \"enlightenment\".\n\nAll fake magical systems use a similar trick.\n\n\"Do the work\".\n\nOr \"My journey\".\n\nThey hypnotize people with romantic make believe.\n\nWhat you need, to insure you aren't being fooled, is super cool impossible magic.\n\nBut at first all you get is a little man in a hot air balloon flying over the pavement for half a second.\n\nI suppose the takeaway for you is, all day silence won't do the job.\n\nThat's just practice for the evening, when you have to find a technique which reliably produces magic.\n\nThen you use that magic, to perfect your silence.\n\nIt grows daily due to the nature of how sorcery works.\n\nSo ideally, in the case of that little man in the hot air balloon, the goal would be to get him to return daily, until you can leap down into the balloon and go riding with him for a few hours.\n\nIn your physical body.\n\nBut that's not a likely path, and it's very hard to repeat stuff.\n\nUsually it's best to just accept the magical gifts you get, and not care if you can repeat them.\n\nThen another one will come along as if you are being taught by don Juan, who does demos for you which you can't repeat.\n\nWe inevitably learn by the same methods all sorcerers learned in the past.\n\nAnother of the laws of sorcery.\n\nYou can only follow an existing path, to get that far into other realities.\n\nNo one can forge their own path in a single lifetime.\n\nBut the same is true of technology.

Or in fact, it likes anytime you aren&amp;#39;t fussing and feeling sorry for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is what the internal dialogue is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you interrupt all that self-pity, &amp;quot;the double&amp;quot; might come around and overlap with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can end up seeing something weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On ferns, maybe some highly colorful triangle attached to a circle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something not there, but which your dreaming attention created while trying to explain what&amp;#39;s going on with your real sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if the assemblage point  drifts, just about anything can appear there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if you are doing &amp;quot;all day&amp;quot; silence it&amp;#39;s not possible to keep that kind of concentration up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But any effort to get silent will help out later, when you can do it alone with privacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;earn&amp;quot; sorcery by &amp;quot;doing your chores&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only attained with creativity and hard work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eastern Meditation systems try to convince people &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time&amp;quot;, even if that takes 3 lifetimes. Just meditate twice a day, perhaps for 20 minutes, and they claim that&amp;#39;ll transform you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They lie!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s no second chances. One life is all we get.  So the idea that it might take more than one lifetime, is totally obscene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But  they have people meditating daily for 10 years before they realize they were lied to and it doesn&amp;#39;t actually work as promised.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By then they&amp;#39;ve weeded out serious people, and all that&amp;#39;s left are the attention seekers who want their own franchise, and are willing to call &amp;quot;bliss&amp;quot; and minor visions during meditation, mostly caused by dozing off, &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All fake magical systems use a similar trick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do the work&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or &amp;quot;My journey&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They hypnotize people with romantic make believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you need, to insure you aren&amp;#39;t being fooled, is super cool impossible magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at first all you get is a little man in a hot air balloon flying over the pavement for half a second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose the takeaway for you is, all day silence won&amp;#39;t do the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just practice for the evening, when you have to find a technique which reliably produces magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you use that magic, to perfect your silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It grows daily due to the nature of how sorcery works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So ideally, in the case of that little man in the hot air balloon, the goal would be to get him to return daily, until you can leap down into the balloon and go riding with him for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In your physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s not a likely path, and it&amp;#39;s very hard to repeat stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually it&amp;#39;s best to just accept the magical gifts you get, and not care if you can repeat them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then another one will come along as if you are being taught by don Juan, who does demos for you which you can&amp;#39;t repeat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We inevitably learn by the same methods all sorcerers learned in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another of the laws of sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can only follow an existing path, to get that far into other realities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one can forge their own path in a single lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the same is true of technology.

And then he curled his fingers, to further distract his tendency to focus his awareness on \"the self\" and how it's doing in regards to our social world.\n\nSomething you get to visibly see as you advance.  It has to do with where the internal dialogue comes from.  If you \"flood\" your senses, you help stop that *thing* at its \"origin\".  It stops fantasizing, which is what drives the internal dialogue.\n\nIt's like distracting a poorly behaved little kid, with something that captures it's attention. To get it to shut up and sit down, and stop misbehaving.\n\nAlthough it's not as effective as handing a kid a video game machine.\n\nUnfortunately, no one Carlos was teaching ever learned any actual sorcery...  \n\nAnd they all were aware of \"flooding the senses\".\n\nMostly no one learned because he died too soon.  \n\nAnd next in line for why it didn't work, is that Carlos assumed the situation was as it was in the lineages.  That people actually wanted to learn, and were grateful to have real sorcerers helping them.\n\nThey didn't, and they weren't.\n\nCarlos didn't realize how bad it was outside the lineages.  The endless capacity of students to pretend, and engage in greedy acts designed to create their own franchise for stealing from others as soon as the teacher isn't looking.\n\nNo one in a lineage would dare to engage in that behavior!  \n\nSilvio Manuel would pick them up by the neck and hurl them to their inevitable death through the wall of fog.  Surviving only if the senior lineage members decided to go rescue them.\n\nBy the way, Cholita could do that.  So don't doubt it's possible.  She's lifted me up into the air a full foot, with one finger.\n\nMore times than I can recall.\n\nI thought I was a goner when I got home last night.

It has to do with where the internal dialogue comes from.  If you &amp;quot;flood&amp;quot; your senses, you help stop that &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; at its &amp;quot;origin&amp;quot;.  It stops fantasizing, which is what drives the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like distracting a poorly behaved little kid, with something that captures it&amp;#39;s attention. To get it to shut up and sit down, and stop misbehaving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although it&amp;#39;s not as effective as handing a kid a video game machine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no one Carlos was teaching ever learned any actual sorcery...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they all were aware of &amp;quot;flooding the senses&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mostly no one learned because he died too soon.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And next in line for why it didn&amp;#39;t work, is that Carlos assumed the situation was as it was in the lineages.  That people actually wanted to learn, and were grateful to have real sorcerers helping them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t, and they weren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos didn&amp;#39;t realize how bad it was outside the lineages.  The endless capacity of students to pretend, and engage in greedy acts designed to create their own franchise for stealing from others as soon as the teacher isn&amp;#39;t looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one in a lineage would dare to engage in that behavior!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silvio Manuel would pick them up by the neck and hurl them to their inevitable death through the wall of fog.

That Tensegrity is USELESS to learn silence, but also that it's the very key to permanent silence.\n\nThere's a \"gremlin\" hidden in that message.  That's why the contradiction.\n\nTry reading my Facebook again, if you already did. That will answer the controversy.\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2293970747428699&amp;set=a.1585701564922291](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2293970747428699&amp;set=a.1585701564922291)\n\nHowever, I don't like to leave people in the dark.\n\nTensegrity is not much different than Chi Gung, Tai Chi, or Yoga stretching exercises, if you consider it as just mere physical movements.\n\nIn that sense, you'll fantasize, stare at the person in front of you hoping for a \"hookup\", worry about bills and relationships, and generally be just as full of self pity and anger as usual.\n\nThe exercise aspect won't stop that.\n\nIn fact, I'll go out on a limb and say Yoga stretching techniques are BETTER exercise than Tensegrity.\n\nThere's no \"Chi Gung\" effect in anything. Not even in Chi gung.\n\nPhysical exercises don't activate your \"hidden magic inside\".\n\nOtherwise Chi Gung people would have some actual magic and be a lot more fun to talk to, instead of self-entitled anger and bullying if you try to talk about it.\n\nBut there's also no \"vitamin effect\" either, and people swallow those all day long.\n\nAnd I'm sorry to tell everyone, probiotics make no sense at all.  And there's never been a single real study showing any benefit at all.  You have 9 pounds of natural probiotics in your system already, with 200-600 varieties.\n\nAdding 1 gram (.00002 of the 9 pounds by weight),  to that total, with no more than 90 varieties, none of which are natural to your situation, is absurd.  \n\nMakes no sense!  And has never been shown to be beneficial. In fact, it's often harmful.\n\nBut there are plenty of \"sponsored\" studies saying it works.\n\nSo as humans we're \"saps\" for doing some easy to do thing daily, and thinking it's \"making us better\".\n\nIt's \"hope\" in the river of shit.  The destruction of magic lies in false hope.\n\nBUT, the tensegrity does move your assemblage point and it does stir unused emanations shared in common with the old seers.\n\nOnes in the dark sea with some latent awareness still hanging out there.\n\nThink of it as a \"good\" power object.\n\nCompared to the rock with a hole in it that Pablito found near a Mexican pyramid, by noticing the \"sparkle\" using silent knowledge.

And there&amp;#39;s never been a single real study showing any benefit at all.  You have 9 pounds of natural probiotics in your system already, with 200-600 varieties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adding 1 gram (.00002 of the 9 pounds by weight),  to that total, with no more than 90 varieties, none of which are natural to your situation, is absurd.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Makes no sense!  And has never been shown to be beneficial. In fact, it&amp;#39;s often harmful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there are plenty of &amp;quot;sponsored&amp;quot; studies saying it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as humans we&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;saps&amp;quot; for doing some easy to do thing daily, and thinking it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;making us better&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;hope&amp;quot; in the river of shit.  The destruction of magic lies in false hope.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, the tensegrity does move your assemblage point and it does stir unused emanations shared in common with the old seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ones in the dark sea with some latent awareness still hanging out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think of it as a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; power object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Compared to the rock with a hole in it that Pablito found near a Mexican pyramid, by noticing the &amp;quot;sparkle&amp;quot; using silent knowledge.

To answer your question, no I don't like it. It's very frustrating. It would be a lot easier for all of us struggling to reach the 3rd attention if more people were aware. But considering what's out there, in the Universe at large, it's not surprising. The \"ones who shall not be named\" have a strong hold over all of us.

Years ago, Miles told a friend of mine that worked with him at Tilo that the Nagual told them Cleargreen would probably last about 10 years after he left, so the fact it's around at all is a good sign. Not to mention, Kylie did say this quote in the 90s, so they knew it would happen. I'm sure they are upset about what's happening to a degree, but once you get out in the universe, beyond the safety of the 1st attention and beyond that seductive world of the inorganics, that will trap you in the sweetest of ways (at least us men), the Universe is highly predatory. It takes all of their attention to continue on, so I'm sure they are focused on that.

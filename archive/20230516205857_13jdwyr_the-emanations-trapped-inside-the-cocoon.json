The view and the warnings are the same phenomena.\n\nI clearly saw fragments buzzing around, which might be what this passage refers to.\n\nBut not all were thin like thread.  I was surprised to see some were \"flatish\" and wider than they ought too be.  With jagged irregularities, like their edges were trying to move out and created small branches.\n\nBut then they'd move a bit in space due to me gazing in \"depth\",  and I saw straight ones which were too long to find the ends.\n\nWe'll just need more seers to figure out why don Juan describes this \"trapped\" thing going on.\n\nHe says it causes death, but then there's the tumbler from the outside cracking open the egg, so that is also a cause of death.\n\nIt says here in the quote that Techno relayed from the poster, that you live longer if you stop agitating them.

However, your question about the possibility of a nearby \"dead star\" closer than the nearest known star is a scientific inquiry that can be addressed.\n\nThe nearest known star system to Earth is the Alpha Centauri system, which is about 4.37 light-years away, or roughly 25.6 trillion miles. A \"dead star\" could refer to a number of different astronomical objects, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes, which are remnants of stars after they have exhausted their nuclear fuel.\n\n1. **White Dwarfs:** These are the remnants of low- to medium-mass stars and are relatively dim. They could potentially go unnoticed if they are not part of a binary system or if they are far away from Earth.\n2. **Neutron Stars:** These are remnants of high-mass stars and are also relatively dim unless they are part of a binary system or are emitting strong radiation, such as X-rays.\n3. **Black Holes:** These are remnants of very high-mass stars and are invisible against the backdrop of space, detectable only by their gravitational effects on nearby objects or by radiation emitted from material falling into them.\n\nThere's always a possibility that there are such objects closer to us than Alpha Centauri, but they have not been detected yet due to their dim or invisible nature. Astronomers use various methods and instruments to detect these objects, including gravitational wave observatories, X-ray telescopes, and other types of electromagnetic radiation detectors. The field of astronomy is advancing, and new discoveries are made frequently. However, as of now, there hasn't been any confirmed discovery of such a \"dead star\" closer to us than the Alpha Centauri system.\n\nThe detection of such objects would require a combination of advanced observational techniques and perhaps a bit of luck.

To clean those out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that your &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; only focuses on the trace awareness you have, in things that are important to you that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To allow those to guide intent, to assemble a world corresponding to the answer to what you were wondering about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we KNOW already how to travel into the past. It&amp;#39;s not even difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t have to wonder about that part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it is true that a lot of the tensegrity moves curve or flex the back, to &amp;quot;uncrust&amp;quot; energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most don&amp;#39;t realize it, but the &amp;quot;mashing energy for intent&amp;quot; passes are almost more about the back, then the feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos made that clear in private classes with a hand thrust, which Cleargreen seems to have removed or forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If done &amp;quot;mechanically&amp;quot; like a robot, you can feel how the twisting at the hips to walk sideways while doing the mashing energy series, makes the back twist left and right too.  Just turn at the hips and waist, and you can feel it in the spine and rib cage&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which &amp;quot;uncrusts&amp;quot; energy body pieces stuck back there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those make the floor visible by lighting up the minor amount of &amp;quot;shiny outer coating&amp;quot; down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pieces of the energy body can stimulate the shiny outer coating to make it glow more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This can all be seen visibly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not vague at all if you can get silent long enough to move the assemblage point at least to the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I have no doubt that if you can &amp;quot;uncrust&amp;quot; energy from your back just by moving the muscles, bending the luminous shell backwards like the old seers did ought to uncrust a heck of a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making on demand silent knowledge work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they intended that to take them into the past, they could certainly do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;Somersault into the Inconceivable&amp;quot;???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5gjuluc64mqb1.jpeg?width=680&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1eff63a598076a97b864aceca5856c3fdaac3af1\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/5gjuluc64mqb1.jpeg?width=680&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1eff63a598076a97b864aceca5856c3fdaac3af1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_16rymwu", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/16rymwu/perceiving_as_nonhuman/k2afctb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1695739469.0, "media_metadata": {"5gjuluc64mqb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpeg", "p": [{"y": 186, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5gjuluc64mqb1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd286537449dbed67ad0bec09a0dafc70bd2317e"}, {"y": 373, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5gjuluc64mqb1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc76916f1fb7457dec0ac89cf6c17de795d185d1"}, {"y": 552, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5gjuluc64mqb1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa8d80c77cfaf79b8a57deea012e175a60e8c4a4"}, {"y": 1105, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5gjuluc64mqb1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeca2fccd3d93d2e2ee411afbfd9c55ca9cc4fdb"}], "s": {"y": 1175, "x": 680, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5gjuluc64mqb1.jpeg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eff63a598076a97b864aceca5856c3fdaac3af1"}, "id": "5gjuluc64mqb1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k29uwr8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Axle-Starweilder", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1695730969.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_16rymwu", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_znic5", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Considering how the Old Seers attempted to bend their awareness backwards, might it be possible that they were trying to stretch their awareness into the past?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_k29uwr8", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering how the Old Seers attempted to bend their awareness backwards, might it be possible that they were trying to stretch their awareness into the past?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/16rymwu/perceiving_as_nonhuman/k29uwr8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1695730969.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_16rymwu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}]

With simple instructions. Like the people charging money to teach the fake stuff do.\n\nThat's why you see me post stuff here on Facebook as \"Too Advanced for the Subreddit\".\n\nI figure Facebook is a lost cause. The \"wild west\" of fake magic. So how can it hurt you, to see more advanced things? Might even cause you to realize, there's no need to pretend!\n\nBut in the subreddit, it's as harmful as I suspected.\n\nBecause when a beginner sees the cooler stuff, it just makes them confused. They don't see how you can learn to open a tunnel in your bedroom, and walk 30 feet past the solid wall to get a better look at a weird creature you see in the neighbor's yard.\n\nI hope it'll motivate people, but it just makes them complain.\n\nThose people of course, are just looking for attention. There's no chance in hell they'll ever put in the work to learn.\n\nMy guess? They aren't frustrated at the lack of instructions. Instructions are all over!\n\nThey're frustrated because they don't know how to lie, to get attention for themselves.   \n\n\nWhat kinds of lies will work, in this subreddit.\n\nMaybe they already got booted from another, and don't want to make the same mistake.\n\nSo the complaint really is, \"How can I make up magic and post it, when you don't make it clear what's ok to pretend in here?\"\n\nAt worst they'll try to destroy the place to prove they are superior.\n\nBut even at best, they'll just memorize enough \"facts\" so they can go out and cheat others by pretending to teach sorcery.\n\nWe had an \"inventory expert\" post about \"the fliers\" just days ago, with one person even continuing to argue about them, minus any direct knowledge of real magic.\n\nBut he was a \"book quote\" genius!\n\nAn \"inventory warrior\".  Deadly to magic.  Only seeking to steal attention with it.\n\nThe way so many bad men have done to our community, that real magic was buried and lost forever.\n\nUntil Little Smoke decided to change that. Chased me all over 4 countries in Asia, to force me to come here.

Eventually both her and Devil's Weed threatened to drive me mad, if I didn't obey.\n\nI had no choice.\n\nShe created the VERY simple process of scooping purple puffs, found in darkness by doing tenserity in silence, onto those \"energy pouches\" Carlos showed us.\n\nEasy to follow instructions, nothing advanced.

It'll cripple you.\n\nThe only thing that matters, is get to work and follow the instructions Little Smoke gave us.\n\nOr, read posts until you understand what it is, and then make your own path from the other things Carlos taught us, like recapitulation, the right way of walking, gazing, or any other technique it the books.\n\nTry to avoid sleeping dreaming for now. It's an ego trap.\n\nLater on, sure!  But not until you are already a sorcerer. As Carlos already was when he did what's written in Art of Dreaming.\n\nExcept the women. Womb dreaming is amazing!

I am so glad I came across this forum.\nI have been exposed to the world of CC and DJ roughly 6-7 years ago through a family friend of my dads who is a seer. I didn\u2019t know he was a seer or what a seer is in the first place. I just knew he was a healer. Never cared too much though until I became his patient. And then I realised that he has a different way of seeing people so I started questioning him about his abilities. He never gave away much just general advice on literature, science, etc. Until one day I asked him if he recommends reading Castaneda (a name I came across when my father tried to make me read it when I was 10, what a joke:). So I asked the healer if he would recommend reading it. He told me\u201d well, if you can swallowed it... FYI I was a convinced Christian.\nSo i started reading them (but not the first 2 books).\nIt was mind boggling and I started experiencing strange states of awareness, just from reading it: tingles in my body, crazy lucid dreams, dreams inside dreams, finding hands, flying,etc. Every night I would lie in bed, I would relax and my assemblage point would shift. My whole body was going tingly and I would go in a deep state of something. I didn\u2019t know what to do with it so I would just indulge in the sensations. I wish I knew then about the darkroom.\nI suppose those were the intent gifts for a beginner. But my self importance took it as that I was talented. What I fool I was. Nevertheless, I started Tensegrity, recapitulation, seminars, etc.\nBut the magic was fading away. I was having less and less of everything. I started to loose hope and replacing the magic with intellectual knowledge: daoism, yoga, literature.\nUntil I came across you guys a month or so ago.\nI started immediately (well almost).\nI have been doing it 3 weeks so far with various levels of success.\nFrom the first nigh I have seen the white-silver puffs, then northern light type of light, I have seen purple puffs, orange puffs, red puffs and green puffs. They were not big, they didn\u2019t last long but they were real.\nAnd the assemblage point movement was real. Because it was not boring.\nI again thought \u201cthat was easy, I must be talented\u201d . Again, what a fool...\nNext days were not so easy but I continued and still continue the practice.\n\nThings I seen so far : white puffs, black energy flows (my favourites) and I have once seen something like a pattern. Not sure if it was the cobweb or the wall or neither of them. I also glimpsed something like a small face but it dissolved to quickly. Sometimes I fee like I have a solid light coming either from behind me or from my right side. But when I turn, it is not there. \nI also saw some random images but very real (like a piece of wood with a metal lock on it). But that might be just me falling asleep. I try to keep awake by doing tensegrity passes, Zuleica\u2019s pass and the pass in which you turn your head to touch your shoulders and chest. And then I just walk. Sometimes I feel fear (especially when doing passes). Sometimes I see my hands moving or my knees moving.\nThings that I am struggling with: falling asleep when I am too tired. Even with all the passes. It might be the workouts but not sure. I also noticed that after a good night comes a bad day for inner silence. \nIf at night I manage to achieve a deep silence then next day my dialogue is harassing me. On one occasion I couldn\u2019t get rid of a song in my head for 3-4 days in a row\ud83d\ude16\nI also struggle with the duration. The most I have done is 2h30 min but I might have been asleep for 20-30 min. My average is 1.5h give or take.\nIt is harder the first 20-30 min. Then it becomes exciting for another 30-45 min and then kind of fades away.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ll keep practicing and hopefully I will reach a stage when I can do it without being bored or tired.\n\ud83d\ude4f \nPS sorry for the long post.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Darkroom practice beginner", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_iss8ch", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_7rexulfl", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1600112184.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone \nI thought of introducing myself and sharing my experience so far in darkroom gazing practice.\nFirst of all, thank you guys for sharing your knowledge here.

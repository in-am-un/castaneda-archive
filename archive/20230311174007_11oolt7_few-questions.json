From Oaxaca.  A total drug addict.\n\nNOT a sorcerer at all. A female shaman.\n\nCarlos was from UCLA, but closer to the indian reservations south of Los Angeles, was UC Riverside.\n\nNot UC Los Angeles.\n\nAnd UCR had sucked up the \"genuine indian informants\" along the path going south to Mexico.\n\nMy father was working with Lowell Bean, to learn about power plants from the shamans at Morongo Indian reservation.  I used to tag along starting at age 9, as far as I can remember.  Maybe at 8 though.\n\nBut Carlos was determined to get a PhD, based on studying the use of power plants among native americans.\n\nHe was taken to Morongo, possibly first stop for him, by a woman named Joanie Baker.\n\nWho I highly suspect was a total anthropologist groupie.\n\nMy father might even have been mixed up with her.\n\nIn late 1997, Carlos even took me to meet Joanie at his house on Pandora, and has us shake hands.\n\nMaking a joke I believe.\n\nAs Bruce Wagner told me back in private classes, \"Carlos knows exactly who your father is.\"\n\nAnd in fact, when Carobeth Laird, the famous Lakota shamaness who got a degree in the UC system was dying in the hospital, Carlos visited her just before my father did, and I got to hear about the famous \"claw hand door knob\" technique meeting Carlos had with her, before it ended up in one of the books of Carlos.\n\nAt least, that's the best I can reconstruct of something that happened in my childhood, so long ago. I wish I'd written the story my father told me of Carlos' visit to her, so I could have it today.  All I know is, he did in fact visit her.\n\nCarlos approached the shamans there at Morongo, most likely Ruby Modesto first, and was told they were already working with UC Riverside.\n\nSo they couldn't be \"informant\" for him.\n\nBut Ruby said that,  back in the past there were men like don Juan \"all over that valley\".\n\nShe pointed Carlos east.\n\nSo Carlos traveled around, until he ended up locating don Juan.\n\nNow here's the interesting part.\n\nDon Juan was NOT a shaman.\n\nNot in any way!!!\n\nHe COULD NOT give Carlos what he wanted, based on his actual practices.\n\nCarlos needed a \"genuine pure blood native american practicing their historically accurate magic\".\n\nOr his PhD hopes would be destroyed.\n\nImagine if he had to tell the PhD committee that he studied with a man named don Juan, originally a Yaqui indian (he was), who belonged to a secret lineage of 15 sorcerers per generation, most Mexican and not actually pure indian, and that lineage included a Chinese pirate, an 8000 year old Olmec seer, a bishop in the catholic \"mission\" system, and some random witches picked up because they were found to be destitute.\n\nThat does happen to witches from time to time. Cholita became destitute so I had to bring her to live with me.\n\nNow how do you think that would go over with the PhD committee?\n\nDoesn't sound much like \"genuine native american traditions\".\n\nIt wouldn't go over.  Carlos COULD NOT accept that.\n\nBut don Juan could see that Carlos was the coveted, \"double male\" that his lineage needed, in order to copy itself.\n\nDon Juan HAD to get Carlos to go with him and learn.\n\nSo he convinced Carlos he could teach him \"A genuine Yaqui way of knowledge\".\n\nAnd Carlos fell for that!  We see it clearly in his first book.\n\nIt was total bullshit.  \n\nFrankly, the Yaquis are as inept when it comes to actual sorcery and magic, as any other tribe in the americas.\n\nAll crappy shamanism, designed to steal money from others.\n\nSurely, it's better than Yogi's or wanna-be Buddha types.\n\nBut just barely.\n\nAnd because modern shamanism sucks so badly, don Juan instead taught him about the Olmec shamans.\n\nThe ones from at least 4000 years ago, who's knowledge history started 8000  years ago or more.\n\nThe ORIGINAL shamans.\n\nNOT sorcerers.\n\nSorcerers are *seers*.\n\nShamans use rituals, spirits, and power plants, to do magic.\n\nWith very limited results, since they MUST have the ritual.\n\n\"Seers\", sorcerers, are a completely different animal.\n\nThey can design a new magical ritual in just 3 days if they have a reason.\n\nYou want a magic carpet?  FOR REAL???!!!\n\nI can tell you how to do that.  Because I've learned to see.\n\nWhat Carlos told us to learn.\n\nBut the old crappy \"Men of Knowledge\", had to be passed down a ritual, from a \"benefactor\".\n\nAnother shitty con artist shaman.\n\nIf you read carefully, you'll see that what I just told you is true. In the books themselves. \n\nBut completely ignored by 100% of the readers of his books.\n\nAnd you should study the lecture notes that pass through here, such as the one of don Juan calling Carlos an \"asshole\", because Carlos called him a \"shaman\".\n\nSo remember, don Juan told Carlos he was going to teach him an alternate view of the world. That of the \"Men of Knowledge\".\n\nHe admitted that his real goal was to teach Carlos to \"see\".\n\nTo reach \"Silent Knowledge\".  Also our goal in here (besides  having a lot of fun with real magic).\n\nDon Juan explained, Carlos already had his current \"view of the world\".\n\nIf he learned a really weird alternate view, he might \"slip through the middle\" and learn to \"see\".\n\nEveryone forgets that, so you end up with total loosers pretending to be \"Men of Knowledge\", who often insist on wearing a rambo headband and changing their name to something absurd like, \"Ken Eagle Feather\".\n\nDon't be like those guys.\n\nEverything in the first 4 books pertains to the Men of Knowledge.\n\nNot to us.\n\nJust keep that in mind.\n\nAll modern shamanism is derived from those Olmec Men of Knowledge.\n\nWho were so awful, the Olmec government (they had the first in the americas), required them to get licenses.\n\nIn here, we just ban them if they start acting badly.\n\nIf you screw up and start thinking you are learning what's in the first 4 books, you're doomed.\n\nThat doesn't even make sense.\n\nThat magic requires:\n\n1   The original ritual, developed over HUNDREDS of years.  And we don't have those anymore.  And no one has the skill to make up a new one.  You have to either have hundreds of years, or be able to \"see\" to make those.\n\n2  The drugs.  We have those.  So that's all the idiots who don't read well focus on.  Attention seeking through drugs.\n\nAnd the most important for shamans:\n\n3 The ally\n\nWe have little smoke and Devil's weed, from those books.\n\nCarlos introduced one entire private class to them.\n\nBut the \"shamans\" out there do not have an Ally.\n\nSome take drugs, and one comes to visit.  Mostly with their eyes closed, sitting there like the pathetic Buddha.\n\nMaria Sabina was like that.\n\nNone can summon them sober, as far as I can tell.\n\nSo modern shamans only have 1 of those 3 requirements to do those amazing magical rituals from the books.\n\nDon't focus on those at all, or you are doomed to never learn.\n\nLook around, you'll see it's true.\n\nIt's endless horrors outside this subreddit, with endless greedy bad men, trying to steal from others based on phony knowledge.\n\nShamans.

learn.\n\nBut no one from another \"system\" such as Buddhism, ever will succeed at getting silent.\n\nBecause the smallest levels of silence take you to the green line on the J curve, which is where \"self-flattery\" flourishes.\n\nSo they stop there.\n\nAnd become angry if you suggest there's a lot more.\n\nLike someone who won't get out of bed, they'll growl and bite if needed.\n\nJust be a \"silence junky\".\n\nIf it's too hard, you have to be creative.\n\nI'm nearly silent all the time.\n\nIf I'm outdoors, I can cause really odd stuff to happen, with a tiny effort.\n\nOne thing I noticed  yesterday, is stop lights.\n\nIf it's too painful to remember to be silent all day long, just be silent at all stoplights while driving.\n\nIf that's too  hard, just be silent while making left turns from stop lights.\n\nWhen you can be silent during the entire turning of the car, then increase to being silent  the instant you are stopped at the light.\n\nBe creative, and you'll succeed.\n\nThe ones who fail are the ones who whine and cry to us, asking for help.\n\nIf it were Cholita here instead of me, you might get an answer to a request for help, that's like the following but with the swear words in spanish.\n\n\"You little bastard.

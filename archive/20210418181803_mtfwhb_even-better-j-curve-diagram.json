Cholita has me on a tight string.\n\nBut I'll just say, one type of bad player doesn't like to see pictures like this.\n\nThey pretend it's \"unseemly\", or something like that.\n\nWhat it is, is disruptive.\n\nTo the people who are interested in attention from other people, and don't like to see actual magic.\n\nBut I must admit.

But no one ever keeps that up, because it's not very convincing.\n\nAs for your #1, #2, and #3, those are possibilities.\n\nBut there are so many things you can learn in the darkroom, all of which are pretty astounding magic, that a list is not possible.\n\nFor example, I was playing Tetris with the puffs last night.  Just sitting on the bed, commanding them where to move, so as to form something larger.\n\nWill I write up how to do that?\n\nNo point.  People can discover their own fun things, when they get that kind of control.\n\nSo in general that's the way things are going in here.  Your list of what to do.\n\nBut it's not the only thing that can happen.\n\nCarlos described those 3, so they're a good start.\n\n\\&gt; What happens if you meet your double in the dark room? What can he/it help you with?\n\nIf you meet him or her, it seems to be safe even with the warnings about not looking them in the eyes. They seem to know that too, and make sure it doesn't happen.\n\nHowever, it could turn out that's just a trick, the claim that the universe will explode if you look into his eyes.  Perhaps to add a little fright to  us, so our assemblage points move more easily.\n\nCholita helps me out with sudden fright all the time, so I get to see how well that works.\n\nRemember all the random shouting don  Juan and Genaro did, while teaching Carlos.  Randomly scaring him, any way they could.  And making fun of him, to embarrass him.\n\nThe assemblage point is held in place with our internal dialogue. Sudden fright knocks it loose.\n\nThe dreaming double is in fact very scary the first few times you run into it.\n\nWhat they can do for you, is find the \"abstract\".\n\nIt needs you, and him, in the same place, to find the abstract on purpose.\n\nOr an inorganic being can push you into it, but that's usually to trap you.\n\nThe abstract seems to add the element of time and space to your darkroom abilities.\n\nLike \"secret sauce\" poured over everything.\n\nIt can also form objects.\n\nAnd trap you.\n\nBut forget all that.\n\nAll you really need at first,  is to find some of those puffs and hold one in your hand.\n\nYou have to get past where the bad players in here are.\n\nThey have no magic, so they cause trouble to get attention for themselves.\n\nGet yourself even a tiny bit of magic your friends won't believe, and then think about it again.\n\nBe the little kid at the shopping Mall who has $10 in his pocket, running around with his friends who have absolutely no money.\n\nThe kids with no money just go around causing trouble in the shopping mall, and fighting with each other.\n\nThese days, taking selfies I suppose.

But no one ever keeps that up, because it&amp;#39;s not very convincing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for your #1, #2, and #3, those are possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there are so many things you can learn in the darkroom, all of which are pretty astounding magic, that a list is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, I was playing Tetris with the puffs last night.  Just sitting on the bed, commanding them where to move, so as to form something larger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will I write up how to do that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No point.  People can discover their own fun things, when they get that kind of control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in general that&amp;#39;s the way things are going in here.  Your list of what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not the only thing that can happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos described those 3, so they&amp;#39;re a good start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; What happens if you meet your double in the dark room? What can he/it help you with?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you meet him or her, it seems to be safe even with the warnings about not looking them in the eyes. They seem to know that too, and make sure it doesn&amp;#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it could turn out that&amp;#39;s just a trick, the claim that the universe will explode if you look into his eyes.  Perhaps to add a little fright to  us, so our assemblage points move more easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita helps me out with sudden fright all the time, so I get to see how well that works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember all the random shouting don  Juan and Genaro did, while teaching Carlos.  Randomly scaring him, any way they could.  And making fun of him, to embarrass him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The assemblage point is held in place with our internal dialogue. Sudden fright knocks it loose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dreaming double is in fact very scary the first few times you run into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What they can do for you, is find the &amp;quot;abstract&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It needs you, and him, in the same place, to find the abstract on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or an inorganic being can push you into it, but that&amp;#39;s usually to trap you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The abstract seems to add the element of time and space to your darkroom abilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like &amp;quot;secret sauce&amp;quot; poured over everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can also form objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And trap you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But forget all that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All you really need at first,  is to find some of those puffs and hold one in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to get past where the bad players in here are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They have no magic, so they cause trouble to get attention for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get yourself even a tiny bit of magic your friends won&amp;#39;t believe, and then think about it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be the little kid at the shopping Mall who has $10 in his pocket, running around with his friends who have absolutely no money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kids with no money just go around causing trouble in the shopping mall, and fighting with each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These days, taking selfies I suppose.  We even get some trying to shoot selfies in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the kid with $10 looks in the windows to see what fun things he can have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because now everything is within his reach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(It&amp;#39;s a really little kid who thinks $10 is a lot of money.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_mtfwhb", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even_better_j_curve_diagram/gvgad74/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1619104276.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gvenk0r", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "sososo555", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1619063107.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_mtfwhb", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_qke8u0c", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "So the main ways to perform magic is by practicing silence in a dark room until:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

And hard to remember now. But I'll try.\n\nThe first time what happened was, I was watching an orange cat jump between floors of an apartment building across the street from On 8 in Bangkok.  It's so hot there, everyone and every animal moves very slowly when they walk.  The cat had been chasing rats in slow motion on the narrow street to the hotel entrance.  He was a stray that the Hotel adopted to keep the 10,000 rats surrounding the building, outside the grounds.\n\nI looked away at the larger street.  A tricycle taxi went by.  I turned back, and the cat was on the second story of the apartment building.  There were no stairs, and I was puzzling about how he got  up there in 2 seconds.  He'd been walking so slowly, I couldn't imagine he suddenly sped up and found a way to the second floor without me seeing it.\n\nMy mind was puzzled.  I was already in heightened awareness thanks to Little Smoke and Devil's Weed, who had been chasing me relentlessly all over Asia.\n\nBeing puzzled was enough to move my assemblage point significantly.\n\nI found myself in a cave, large enough to stand up in.  I couldn't see the end of it, but there were rows of \"paintings\" (windows?), and Little Smoke's head was glued to the wall.  He was doing his, \"wise old indian shaman\" imitation, like a Disneyland ride with a narrator head at the entrance.\n\nI was thinking, rather calmly for such a bizarre thing, what am I doing in this cave, and what's this painting on the wall?  Is that a ship on the ocean?\n\nA voice answered, saying it was a ship carrying a Nagual from the 1X00s (can't recall), and one of the more interesting in our lineage.\n\nI realized, he would explain any picture I wanted.  All I had to do was walk deeper in there, and I could learn about our lineage going back as far as the tunnel.\n\nAnd also, I could stick my head into each one, and watch it move.\n\nThey were arranged like the \"furrows\" Carlos had said could save his life if only he could gather enough energetic mass at workshops, to \"jump grooves\".\n\nBut we let him down with all the self-absorption and angry groupie behavior, so he died.\n\nWe killed Carlos.\n\nShortly I found myself back on the hotel steps looking at the cat.  There could be some missing time in there.\n\nThe cat leaped up an entire apartment floor while I watched.  His feet only touched a thick pipe or electrical wire, going from one to the other. I suppose it was all the boost he needed.  A lot like \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", where they just touch a tree branch to keep their flying going.\n\nHe kept hoping up,  probably only 1 or 2 more floors, until he reached the last, at which point he walked along a 2\" pipe connecting the buildings.  It was a 40 foot tightrope walk.\n\nLater I asked the bar girl about the cat, and she said, \"We all love him. He's a star here.  He protects the building in exchange for food.\"\n\nI looked down to the ground. The bar was up 8 or 12 feet. The cat was resting on some rags someone had arranged as a bed.\n\nThe second time, I lost the history lesson right away because I realized where I was.\n\nBook deal mind got me.\n\nThose were daylight visits.  Caused by being in heightened awareness, through stalking.\n\nStalking can get you into heightened awareness, but nearly always it just turns you into a self-absorbed annoying person pretending to be learning sorcery.\n\nIn the darkroom, \"Mystery\" gives me history lessons.\n\nBut it's the history of old seers, and makes no sense to me.\n\nHe showed me one of their techniques.\n\nRocks and patterns in the dirt.\n\nThat's all they had to work with.   Mud.\n\nSome decent huts, but made only out of tree branches, palm fronds and such.\n\nI recommend getting history lessons in the dark room! They're more stable.\n\nWe read that Carlos got so much teaching from the Emissary that he had to ask don Juan how to write it all down. Don Juan told him to only write down the parts pertaining to a particular topic. I can't recall what.\n\nThey really do that!   IOBs do in fact turn into the Emissary for you.\n\nBut don't expect them to put on a professor's robe just before they do it.\n\nThey will in fact do that also,  if  you wish. I had Fancy in a school teacher mini-skirt one night, because I asked her to do that.  \n\nBut, normally you're just doing puffery, they show up, and tell you something.\n\nOnly if you accept the interaction as teaching, do they continue on.\n\nBut don't expect to be brought to their world for the lessons.\n\nThey can bring you to their cave without you actually realizing it.  So just take what you get, and if you want them to keep teaching don't look around too much.\n\nIf you're worried about kidnapping, give it up. You'll never learn sorcery.  You're in pretending mode and will never get around to doing any actual work.\n\nThat's nearly as lame as being afraid to visit Compton, because you might get kidnapped by roaming rap gang members.   They could hold you hostage for many years, making you listen to their latest song.\n\nCompton is in fact lovely, in its own way.  And you'd be lucky to get taken over by Snoop Doggy. He has lots of \"cool\" alcohol.\n\nJust remember this important point: You can't learn sorcery by collecting more information about sorcery.\n\nIt's not possible.\n\nThere's no shame in thinking that. It's how we learn every single other thing in the world.\n\nBut not sorcery.\n\nI suppose the closest analogy is, you can't learn about martial arts, by collecting information about them.\n\nYou have to do it.\n\nBut even more, in this particular community, where we have real magic instead of the pretend stuff you get elsewhere,  it's even slightly harmful to be too obsessed with collecting facts.\n\nYou might entertain or satisfy someone else with your inventory collector tendency, so that they don't take the first step that night, and build themselves a dark room.\n\nA bunch of circumstances (coincidences) have to come together, to get someone to \"jump\".\n\nCarlos use to taunt us to \"jump\" in class, with bizarre tasks we could take on.\n\nLike, walking 134 miles to San Diego, from Santa Monica.  Right after class. Just take off.\n\nHe said it would transform us.\n\nNo one would go. I even held out my credit card, to encourage the women to go for it.\n\nThe men had already left the building.\n\nThe next day Felix asked Carlos about it again, saying, \"now what would happen if we did...\"\n\nIn other words, \"What reward will I get if I do as you suggest?\"\n\nCarlos interrupted him.  \"That was yesterday. It's too late now.\"\n\nIt was always \"circumstances\" that prevented absolutely everyone in private class from doing a task Carlos proposed.\n\nBy collecting inventory in public, you might put a \"fun fact\" in someone's mind, so that in the evening when they have time they aren't desperate for magic anymore, and don't jump that night.\n\nImagine someone is all antsy and unhappy with their life, and they wonder if the puffs of light might in fact be their salvation.\n\nBut they they remember how funny it is to get a lesson from an old shaman, in a magical tunnel.\n\nThey relax on the bed to ponder if that's true or made up, and don't get around to \"jumping\" that evening.\n\nThen, never again do they get the right combination of circumstances to cause them to take action. Their old girlfriend comes back, their dad dies, the rent goes up and they have to move.\n\nThey had just one cubic centimeter of chance to take action, and they lost it because of an entertaining story.\n\nSorcery isn't just a matter of getting around to it. Otherwise people would probably find the time often.\n\nBut it's nutty!   Pointless. Hopeless.\n\nMagic?  Are you crazy???  Who's going to put in hours of work each night, for something stupid like that when they could watch the latest TV shows?\n\nYou have to both have  the time, accept that it's insane, and be desperate enough to get started.", "edited": 1619281324.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gvprqdf", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only seen two.  And hard to remember now. But I&amp;#39;ll try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time what happened was, I was watching an orange cat jump between floors of an apartment building across the street from On 8 in Bangkok.  It&amp;#39;s so hot there, everyone and every animal moves very slowly when they walk.  The cat had been chasing rats in slow motion on the narrow street to the hotel entrance.  He was a stray that the Hotel adopted to keep the 10,000 rats surrounding the building, outside the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked away at the larger street.  A tricycle taxi went by.  I turned back, and the cat was on the second story of the apartment building.  There were no stairs, and I was puzzling about how he got  up there in 2 seconds.  He&amp;#39;d been walking so slowly, I couldn&amp;#39;t imagine he suddenly sped up and found a way to the second floor without me seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mind was puzzled.  I was already in heightened awareness thanks to Little Smoke and Devil&amp;#39;s Weed, who had been chasing me relentlessly all over Asia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being puzzled was enough to move my assemblage point significantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found myself in a cave, large enough to stand up in.  I couldn&amp;#39;t see the end of it, but there were rows of &amp;quot;paintings&amp;quot; (windows?), and Little Smoke&amp;#39;s head was glued to the wall.  He was doing his, &amp;quot;wise old indian shaman&amp;quot; imitation, like a Disneyland ride with a narrator head at the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was thinking, rather calmly for such a bizarre thing, what am I doing in this cave, and what&amp;#39;s this painting on the wall?  Is that a ship on the ocean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A voice answered, saying it was a ship carrying a Nagual from the 1X00s (can&amp;#39;t recall), and one of the more interesting in our lineage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, he would explain any picture I wanted.  All I had to do was walk deeper in there, and I could learn about our lineage going back as far as the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also, I could stick my head into each one, and watch it move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were arranged like the &amp;quot;furrows&amp;quot; Carlos had said could save his life if only he could gather enough energetic mass at workshops, to &amp;quot;jump grooves&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we let him down with all the self-absorption and angry groupie behavior, so he died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We killed Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shortly I found myself back on the hotel steps looking at the cat.  There could be some missing time in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cat leaped up an entire apartment floor while I watched.  His feet only touched a thick pipe or electrical wire, going from one to the other. I suppose it was all the boost he needed.  A lot like &amp;quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&amp;quot;, where they just touch a tree branch to keep their flying going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He kept hoping up,  probably only 1 or 2 more floors, until he reached the last, at which point he walked along a 2&amp;quot; pipe connecting the buildings.  It was a 40 foot tightrope walk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later I asked the bar girl about the cat, and she said, &amp;quot;We all love him. He&amp;#39;s a star here.  He protects the building in exchange for food.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked down to the ground. The bar was up 8 or 12 feet. The cat was resting on some rags someone had arranged as a bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second time, I lost the history lesson right away because I realized where I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Book deal mind got me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those were daylight visits.  Caused by being in heightened awareness, through stalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stalking can get you into heightened awareness, but nearly always it just turns you into a self-absorbed annoying person pretending to be learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the darkroom, &amp;quot;Mystery&amp;quot; gives me history lessons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s the history of old seers, and makes no sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He showed me one of their techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rocks and patterns in the dirt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all they had to work with.   Mud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some decent huts, but made only out of tree branches, palm fronds and such.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recommend getting history lessons in the dark room! They&amp;#39;re more stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We read that Carlos got so much teaching from the Emissary that he had to ask don Juan how to write it all down. Don Juan told him to only write down the parts pertaining to a particular topic. I can&amp;#39;t recall what.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They really do that!   IOBs do in fact turn into the Emissary for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t expect them to put on a professor&amp;#39;s robe just before they do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They will in fact do that also,  if  you wish. I had Fancy in a school teacher mini-skirt one night, because I asked her to do that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, normally you&amp;#39;re just doing puffery, they show up, and tell you something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only if you accept the interaction as teaching, do they continue on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t expect to be brought to their world for the lessons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can bring you to their cave without you actually realizing it.  So just take what you get, and if you want them to keep teaching don&amp;#39;t look around too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re worried about kidnapping, give it up. You&amp;#39;ll never learn sorcery.  You&amp;#39;re in pretending mode and will never get around to doing any actual work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s nearly as lame as being afraid to visit Compton, because you might get kidnapped by roaming rap gang members.

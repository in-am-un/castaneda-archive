So I suppose, I should be a bit suspicious.\n\nI was hoping to snag an audio recording of Cholita's new \"poltergeist\", but it seems to have figured out I was trying to do that and turned the whole thing into a game of hide and seek.\n\nWith a female twist.  It does something seductive regarding the sounds I'm trying to capture, but in such a way that it's too late by the time I realize what just happened.\n\nBut I was having incredible luck with everything else.\n\nThat you see in the picture was just a tiny fraction of what I was doing.\n\nCholita interrupted my attempt to leap past our galaxy, onto another world.\n\nI was sort of \"pondering\" how to verify if the new planet was inside our galaxy, or outside it.\n\nSelf-reflection for sure.  It didn't help.\n\nThe view started to fade, I removed the fantasizing, and it returned.\n\nI was looking at a place where stars form.\n\nMy thought was, maybe that doesn't happen inside the galaxy, and that's proof?\n\nI'm not sure why leaping outside the galaxy is better than leaping inside it.\n\nGreed maybe?\n\nJust as I was about to pick a planet, Cholita shoved her way through the locked door carrying a big fuss of indefinable \"stuff\" with her, like she was trapped in it.\n\nIt didn't occur to me that maybe her poltergeist was bugging her too.  She had a pained look on her face.\n\nBut since she was \"the double\", I didn't think anything needed to be done about it.\n\nI'll have to see what sort of mood she's in today, when I get

Might even decide to turn into the Emissary for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The magic gaze sort of makes all the &amp;quot;puffery&amp;quot; unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still do some.  At least make those 3 &amp;quot;pouches&amp;quot; glow by charging them up with puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little spot you can burn with your gaze, producing visible sparks or twinkles in the air, opens up holes and things can pass both ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan said the &amp;quot;shine&amp;quot; of the gaze was the important thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the &amp;quot;shine&amp;quot; in the eyes.  I can&amp;#39;t recall which.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you get that sort of pinpoint gaze that generates second attention things in the air,  you do feel like the eyes are radiating light out, which causes the results in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cleargreen should have evolved to teach this using visual aids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It probably wouldn&amp;#39;t work to stick everyone in a dark room and have them gaze left and right together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a big fan of &amp;quot;practicing failure&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you could have them sit in a dark room, and Miles could move a little LED laser light that simulates the intense gaze, and explain to them how to develop it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand why things didn&amp;#39;t get that far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The LED laser light needs to be mostly white.  No red.  Some blue or yellow is natural.  Think of twinkling diamonds in an expensive hotel with excellent overhead lighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That kind of sparkle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure you can find a laser like that, but if you could just sweep it back and forth so it hits a curved surface.  If it&amp;#39;s dark, it should look like it&amp;#39;s hanging in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to go deluxe, have a laser projector with a picture ready to go, and have it &amp;quot;turn on&amp;quot; when the gaze slowly moves back and forth over the same 1/2 foot area.  Show how to &amp;quot;open a portal&amp;quot;, and how real it will look when they succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will that teach people how to do it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably not (we don&amp;#39;t yet know), but it might get them off their butts hoping to duplicate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then, they&amp;#39;ll find their own &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;intend&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; to make progress, that&amp;#39;s the main thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then act in a sustained fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos emphasized &amp;quot;sustained action&amp;quot;, but that got taken over by bad players, and turned into something very ugly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_nvehdz", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/nvehdz/how_to_leave_the_galaxy/h134l6f/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1623193026.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h12xral", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_nvehdz", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "Since a long time i got to the maze today.

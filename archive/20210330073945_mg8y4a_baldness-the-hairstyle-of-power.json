I've been thinking about shaving my head for since about a week before I found this subreddit. Even though the COVID situation is getting better, I'm still kinda paranoid about going to the barber's. My hair was getting a bit long and unmanageable, and I thought I might as well just get rid of it so I don't have to waste so much time washing/combing it every day. I read an old post from Dan Saturday night saying that intent is more likely to gift you if you intend something funny (I'm just paraphrasing, I've once again failed to save the post I'm referencing and I have no clue what post the comment was under.) I thought it might work the opposite way around too, do something stupid and kinda funny and your intent will get stronger. So I the next morning I just fucking went for it and clippered my \\~8 inches of hair off and then shaved myself bald. I was having second thoughts as I turned the clippers on, but I silenced my thoughts and just absolutely belted \"INTENT!\" and then went to town. I certainly felt some kind of strange feeling afterward, but I'm not sure what to call it. But I did have a particularly good night last night, and here's why I think the hairstyle of power works: releasing attachments and overcoming fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost men are somewhat attached to their hair, and fear what people will think if they lose it. By shaving it off you literally and figuratively detach yourself from it. And then you can overcome that fear by seeing that the repercussions aren't so bad. Honestly, it my coworkers' reactions today were pretty funny, that alone made it worth it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if there are any other beginners who want a little boost, maybe give the Hairstyle of Power a try. Or maybe just make some time to do recapitulation. That's probably better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Proof that I'm actually bald and not just trying to bamboozle the noobs\\]([https://i.imgur.com/52RfDZk.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/52RfDZk.jpg))", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Baldness: The Hairstyle of Power?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_mg8y4a", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 7, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 7, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1617082785.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve heard of techniques of power, objects of power, and places of power, but I bring you something special today : the Hairstyle of Power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Shaving your head will not automatically give you super powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay let&amp;#39;s get serious.

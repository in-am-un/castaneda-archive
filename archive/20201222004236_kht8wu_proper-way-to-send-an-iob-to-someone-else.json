But if you can&amp;#39;t get lucid, you can&amp;#39;t test that out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that case, see if you don&amp;#39;t end up in an &amp;quot;emergency&amp;quot; with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where they cause you to become semi lucid (paranoid), as a result of their dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you get truly frightened.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_kht8wu", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/kht8wu/proper_way_to_send_an_iob_to_someone_else/ggqmzmk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1608677627.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1608677627.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ggqjxgr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "monkeyguy999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ggpdc3b", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_14w1ssx0", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Maybe you can't force them to do something.

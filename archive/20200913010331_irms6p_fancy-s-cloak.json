You force yourself mentally silent, and look for things in the darkness.\n\nAnd typically, in my case, with 4 shots of espresso so I don\u2019t fall asleep.\n\nFor most people, the images will be dim and vague. But that's only because the assemblage point hasn't moved very far yet. You can see a different strength to each of the images here. I matched it to exactly what happened during the last 3 days.\n\nWhen the images are super bright and real looking, you shouldn't imagine this is simply a dream I fell into.\n\nThe beings are like visitors, not dreams. It's as if they snuck into my bedroom without Cholita hearing, and then played with me all night.\n\nThey can even move physical objects, or travel with you outside the room, into another world.\n\nAnd the good news is, Inorganic Beings are interactive! And they have a very good memory.\n\nThey also like to teach.\n\nIt shouldn't be surprising. In Carlos' books, Little Smoke is constantly being used to teach all of the apprentices.\n\nAs it turns out, they'll do that on their own, even if there's no don Juan to put them up to it.\n\nDon Juan claimed you could make them do anything you want.\n\nI sincerely doubt Fancy would get me a beer from the fridge, if I asked.\n\nShe might even go women\u2019s lib on me and do something scary.\n\nBut for abstract things, maybe they will!\n\nI\u2019ve only just realized how they work.\n\nAs you play with them, they\u2019ll help you play more. Better. Stronger.\n\nAnd so they automatically teach how to move the assemblage point.\n\nBut as you are practicing, they seem to notice what\u2019s causing you to fail. What makes your internal dialogue come back.\n\nSo they continue to help. Even if that requires a several day \u201cmission\u201d.\n\nThis mission by Fancy started with me noticing what looked like a \u201cGremlin\u201d. I tried to chase it deep into the second attention, because this creature gives off the most wonderful feeling of bliss and magic that a human could desire.\n\nIn Jewish literature, you could call it the \u201cShekhinah Glory\u201d. Not the sight. But the feelings that come from viewing it.\n\nI decided it must be a manifestation of \u201cthe Nagual\u201d, but really had no basis for that.\n\nI couldn\u2019t catch it.\n\nBut it came back a time or two, and remained up on the wall for me to view.\n\nOnce I started playing with Fancy, I stopped chasing it.\n\nBut Fancy noticed my obsession.\n\nAnd one day as I was standing by my dresser, she appeared as a little red riding hood figure. Just her head.\n\nThe spot where she appeared, was the last place I saw the Gremlin.\n\nIt was also the same place Fairy had consumed those 2 red lines of light, and passed out on the floor.\n\nI suppose I ought to pay more attention to that spot.\n\nFancy didn\u2019t speak. But suddenly I had the idea of \u201csliding dreaming\u201d. I looked into her face, and realized she was offering to teach me something.\n\nIf this happens to you,  a little warning might help.\n\nYou'll have the idea, then wonder, \"Did you say something\", and then feel silly because clearly it was your own thought.\n\nBut you didn't think it on purpose!\n\nThat's the key.\n\nFancy relocated as you see in that picture, producing a strange curtain of some kind. I realized that she could produce an \u201cintent disruption\u201d that way, as long as I was the one directing where she went, using my hand.\n\nAt this position of the assemblage point, very close to the final resting place on the J curve, the room will contain both puffs of color, and whitish lines on all flat surfaces.\n\nWhich you pay attention to, emphasizes which there will be more of.\n\nThe whitish lines are \u201cseeing energy on the horizon\u201d. As Carlos explained, you can watch it as if it were a movie.\n\nWhat you see is determined by a mix of your own *intent*, the nature of the energy, and that outside force of *intent*.\n\nIf you \u201cconcentrate\u201d it with your palm, by visually passing it over the lines, disruptions and distortions appear, and \u201cthings\u201d come from them.\n\nYou don't \"rub the wall\".  You just point your palm towards it. That's enough.\n\nFancy was instead teaching me to push her with my hand, as if she were a curtain I could open, and look inside reality.  The principle was sound.  An IOB is much better than a hand, for producing intent disruptions.\n\nI can\u2019t possibly recreate what happened, but this is close enough.\n\nHer moving cloak disrupted each spot where it passed, and an object formed there.\n\nIt looked like a sea of trash, floating at random.  There were visible \"waves\". Possible echos of her cloak folds.\n\nI could stick my hand into it, and extract real, solid objects.\n\nI don't mean to imply my hand could feel them.\n\nIt just never occurred to me it wouldn't, so I didn't check.\n\nOr better explained, my dreaming body put its hand in there, and pulled out the object.\n\nSo I had no reason to check if I \"felt it\".\n\nI pulled several things from there, tossing them to my left as soon as I saw what I removed.\n\nThat night, they were all metal machine parts. Rounder than that one, and unrecognizable.\n\nAlien junk, that's what it was.\n\nThe next day, Fancy decided to form a \u201cring\u201d for me. She\u2019d offered that several days earlier, and I\u2019d forgotten.\n\nI had found a mass of golden goo, which gave off \u201cfeelings\u201d.  An eerie blob.\n\nI\u2019d learned, by looking for feelings, that those can move your assemblage point as easily as you can with colors.\n\nThe trouble was locating the feelings.\n\nI supposed it\u2019s best to explain this way.\n\nAs a child, you had a connection to the Nagual.\n\nBut it was taken away from you by the adults.\n\nThose connections were many.\n\nFor instance, you got a fever, your assemblage point moved, and you found some \u201cfeeling\u201d that was really nice.\n\nYou learned to look forward to that \u201cfeeling\u201d, each time you had a fever.\n\nChildren have many such feelings, and some stand out vividly because they contain elements of  feelings which come from the second attention.\n\nBy remembering those feelings, you have a direct connection deep into the second attention.\n\nYou can use that to move your assemblage point just as effectively as colors in darkness.\n\nThe problem with using \u201cfeelings\u201d is just that it can be abused, to get attention for yourself.\n\nYou can lie to yourself about your own accomplishments, and never put in the hard work to get very tangible results.\n\nPeople have done that with Lucid Dreaming for decades, never making any real progress, but while telling all of their sorcery buddies how far along they are.\n\nBecause no one can prove otherwise.\n\nNow, the type of person who only cares about self-image, will never learn sorcery. They never wanted that. They just wanted bragging rights.\n\nThe problem is, they go out and deceive and mislead others.\n\nThere are hundreds of them out there, confusing the entire community, and preventing real progress.\n\nSo the use of \u201cfeelings\u201d to move the assemblage point, should sort of be kept to yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s not good at this time, for the community to practice that.\n\nIf on the other hand you have troubles making yourself a dark room, or getting up in the middle of the night, give it a try!\n\nYou have to find a feeling that comes from the second attention. And you have to force yourself silent, so that your assemblage point can follow the feeling.\n\nWhen you find yourself overwhelmed and absorbed in the feeling, which by then will produce a vision, you\u2019re doing it right.\n\nI have no idea where it leads. And it wouldn\u2019t do anyone any good for me to find out. I\u2019ve already learned to move my assemblage point. Can\u2019t start over in any meaningful manner.\n\nThe \u201cring\u201d Fancy made for me was really not practical. I complained to her, and she did an outfit change to a whitish hoodie.\n\nI thought she was trying to pull a fast one, by making it only look as if her head were smaller.\n\nBut it turned out to be practical.  If I didn't want the ring, so be it.\n\nWe're incredibly stupid to inorganic beings. They don't take offense, the same way a 3 year old can't offend a rational adult.\n\nFancy stood up in front of me, and offered to let me pull her to the left, the same way as the night before, and expose her \u201csliding dreaming\u201d view.\n\nAs I was studying the \u201cjunk\u201d produced that way,  I realized some of the pieces gave off different feelings. Like the golden goo I had found earlier.\n\nI saw Bob fly by, kissing Fancy. I hadn\u2019t been thinking about him at all.\n\nHe\u2019s almost like a puppy who follows a larger dog around, hoping to pick up scraps of food.\n\nOnce I saw Bob, I realized Fancy had brought me to her world again. I was inside her ice cave.\n\nA day or two ago I would have worried about how often I ended up in Fancy\u2019s cave.\n\nBut someone posted \u201cinspirational quotes\u201d, indicating Carlos had visited Little Smokes world hundreds of times.\n\nI suppose, they just bring you there when you interact with them.\n\nSo it\u2019s a natural thing to end up going there many, many times.\n\nThey visit you in your world.  And then they manage to combine the two, so you can visit them in their world.\n\nI saw a bundled baby floating in front of me. I didn\u2019t get that pic quite right. It was a friendly male adult, but contorted into that shape and size.\n\nCould have been Bob again for all I know.\n\nBut I knew what that was. Another IOB, manifesting from where he's stuck in the \"hive\".\n\nFancy\u2019s world is sparsely populated. That might be the only entity, other than Fancy and Bob, that I\u2019ve seen there.\n\nI pushed and pulled on him a few times, waving my hand back and forth, to make him glide in the air.\n\nAs you do that, your mind also \"stretches\" in some odd way.\n\nThe last time I did that, Fancy got enough energy to knock down an entire bag of metal parts, producing a frightening crashing sound in the back of my warehouse. I posted it.\n\nI actually saw her fly in there before the crash, and show me where to go after.\n\nShe had caught me thinking about how Fairy used to do that for me.\n\nSo she arranged it herself.\n\n**#1 takeaway from this story:**\n\nIOBs are interactive. Keep trying, it's just a matter of going deeper in the J curve.\n\nIOBs have memory.  They'll remember agreements you made for days, at the very least.\n\nIOBs like to interact with you, which means they automatically teach you cool stuff.\n\nIOBs can be influenced by your concerns, and will often decide to help you out, as if you had asked.\n\n**Learned previously:**\n\nIOBs can be shared.\n\nIOBs can communicate among each other, about you.\n\nIOBs often have friends of their own.  A weaker or less aggressive IOB.\n\nLike young women going bar hopping for men. There's often an aggressive one, and a more conservative one who likes the fallout.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false,

Possible echos of her cloak folds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could stick my hand into it, and extract real, solid objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean to imply my hand could feel them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just never occurred to me it wouldn&amp;#39;t, so I didn&amp;#39;t check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or better explained, my dreaming body put its hand in there, and pulled out the object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I had no reason to check if I &amp;quot;felt it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled several things from there, tossing them to my left as soon as I saw what I removed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night, they were all metal machine parts. Rounder than that one, and unrecognizable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alien junk, that&amp;#39;s what it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day, Fancy decided to form a \u201cring\u201d for me. She\u2019d offered that several days earlier, and I\u2019d forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had found a mass of golden goo, which gave off \u201cfeelings\u201d.  An eerie blob.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d learned, by looking for feelings, that those can move your assemblage point as easily as you can with colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The trouble was locating the feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I supposed it\u2019s best to explain this way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a child, you had a connection to the Nagual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was taken away from you by the adults.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those connections were many.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, you got a fever, your assemblage point moved, and you found some \u201cfeeling\u201d that was really nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You learned to look forward to that \u201cfeeling\u201d, each time you had a fever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Children have many such feelings, and some stand out vividly because they contain elements of  feelings which come from the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By remembering those feelings, you have a direct connection deep into the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can use that to move your assemblage point just as effectively as colors in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with using \u201cfeelings\u201d is just that it can be abused, to get attention for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can lie to yourself about your own accomplishments, and never put in the hard work to get very tangible results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People have done that with Lucid Dreaming for decades, never making any real progress, but while telling all of their sorcery buddies how far along they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because no one can prove otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, the type of person who only cares about self-image, will never learn sorcery. They never wanted that. They just wanted bragging rights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is, they go out and deceive and mislead others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of them out there, confusing the entire community, and preventing real progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the use of \u201cfeelings\u201d to move the assemblage point, should sort of be kept to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not good at this time, for the community to practice that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If on the other hand you have troubles making yourself a dark room, or getting up in the middle of the night, give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to find a feeling that comes from the second attention. And you have to force yourself silent, so that your assemblage point can follow the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you find yourself overwhelmed and absorbed in the feeling, which by then will produce a vision, you\u2019re doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea where it leads. And it wouldn\u2019t do anyone any good for me to find out. I\u2019ve already learned to move my assemblage point. Can\u2019t start over in any meaningful manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The \u201cring\u201d Fancy made for me was really not practical. I complained to her, and she did an outfit change to a whitish hoodie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought she was trying to pull a fast one, by making it only look as if her head were smaller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it turned out to be practical.  If I didn&amp;#39;t want the ring, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re incredibly stupid to inorganic beings. They don&amp;#39;t take offense, the same way a 3 year old can&amp;#39;t offend a rational adult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy stood up in front of me, and offered to let me pull her to the left, the same way as the night before, and expose her \u201csliding dreaming\u201d view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I was studying the \u201cjunk\u201d produced that way,  I realized some of the pieces gave off different feelings. Like the golden goo I had found earlier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw Bob fly by, kissing Fancy. I hadn\u2019t been thinking about him at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s almost like a puppy who follows a larger dog around, hoping to pick up scraps of food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I saw Bob, I realized Fancy had brought me to her world again. I was inside her ice cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A day or two ago I would have worried about how often I ended up in Fancy\u2019s cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But someone posted \u201cinspirational quotes\u201d, indicating Carlos had visited Little Smokes world hundreds of times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose, they just bring you there when you interact with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it\u2019s a natural thing to end up going there many, many times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They visit you in your world.  And then they manage to combine the two, so you can visit them in their world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a bundled baby floating in front of me. I didn\u2019t get that pic quite right. It was a friendly male adult, but contorted into that shape and size.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could have been Bob again for all I know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I knew what that was. Another IOB, manifesting from where he&amp;#39;s stuck in the &amp;quot;hive&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy\u2019s world is sparsely populated. That might be the only entity, other than Fancy and Bob, that I\u2019ve seen there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pushed and pulled on him a few times, waving my hand back and forth, to make him glide in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you do that, your mind also &amp;quot;stretches&amp;quot; in some odd way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last time I did that, Fancy got enough energy to knock down an entire bag of metal parts, producing a frightening crashing sound in the back of my warehouse. I posted it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually saw her fly in there before the crash, and show me where to go after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had caught me thinking about how Fairy used to do that for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she arranged it herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1 takeaway from this story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs are interactive. Keep trying, it&amp;#39;s just a matter of going deeper in the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs have memory.  They&amp;#39;ll remember agreements you made for days, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs like to interact with you, which means they automatically teach you cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs can be influenced by your concerns, and will often decide to help you out, as if you had asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned previously:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs can be shared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs can communicate among each other, about you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs often have friends of their own.  A weaker or less aggressive IOB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like young women going bar hopping for men. There&amp;#39;s often an aggressive one, and a more conservative one who likes the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My assemblage point wasn't in an ideal position to make her as solid and real as in those pictures, so instead she rode on my hand. But the fact that she wasn't perfectly formed, and was usually dim, made a good tool. I could see what gave her more energy. She was right on the \"sweet spot\" for noticing when she got a tiny bit more energy.\n\nI learned far more than I can explain.  But I'll try:\n\nThe gremlin or weird substance which gives off wonderful feelings is precisely what the IOBs want.  They're after the same thing we are!\n\nAt least, that's part of what we want. They don't have the burden of imminent death from old age, so they don't worry about \"escaping to freedom\", an obsession of ours.\n\nBut they do love those \"feelings\" coming from the second attention.  Same as we do.\n\nPerhaps not that specific one (the Gremlin), who is significantly more intense than the \"bliss\" you get in heightened awareness.\n\nBut when we say they are after \"feelings\", like fear, we have to realize that \"feelings\" is a vast world, and we've been banned from most of it by our internal dialogue.\n\nThe Nagual Julian was said to be able to control them very well by dolling out his feelings.  It's hard to picture how you could do that, unless you take into account that the 8 point diagram includes \"feeling\".  Julian was undoubtedly using feelings in a manner we don't understand yet.\n\nBut what about \"emotions\" vs \"feelings\"?\n\nEmotions is the socialized version of feelings. It's tied to the internal dialogue.  But if you think about asking a young person what they love to do most in life, in a \"safe setting\", maybe with a couple of glasses of wine in them, they'll admit sex is what they crave.\n\nSex is the sharing of feelings.  That's what  the IOBs want from us too.\n\nNot just to feel the feeling. But to feel it with someone else. It increases the richness of the feeling.\n\nSo we need to remember that the vast world of feelings is a lot more complicated than our simple world of sex, pain, hunger, and pleasure.\n\nDon  Juan gave us a demo of how it looks, to feed them some \"feelings\",  in the books.\n\nIt's said he contorted his face and had an odd look of surprise.  Then the Little Smoke showed up.\n\nWe'd be making a mistake if we interpreted what he was doing with our normal, very limited understanding.\n\nI pulled aside Fancy's \"cloak\" again, and Fancy went in there and swam around.  She was trying to show me which feelings you could find in there, using facial expressions and how intense or well formed she was.\n\nI can't recall it.  I suppose she was trying to teach me using that center of perception, \"feelings\".  Otherwise, all she has available with which to interact with us,  is *seeing* and *dreaming*.  Maybe *will*, but who knows at this point.\n\nThe technique for finding your own Ally, given in an early book, consists of waving the palm slowly, parallel to the ground, for a whole 180 degrees. Then you turn around and do it for the other 180 degrees. In that manner you span everything.\n\nIf you feel heat in the hand, you run in that direction for a certain distance, and then continue.\n\nEventually you'll find your \"ally\".\n\nIt's all feelings!  Rather than thinking you find the Ally by looking for heat, it's more like you lure the Ally, the same way you can in dreaming by looking from object to object.\n\nThey notice that.  Maybe in dreaming, it's actually the thrill of succeeding, rather than looking at the object.\n\nWhen using the palm technique, you are radiating \"feeling\" from your hand. If you find a hot spot, you just detected something from the second attention.\n\nIt's essentially the same as Lucid dreaming, where you lure a scout.\n\nOr as we've seen, waking dreaming.  Once you find a few puffs that are vivid, IOBs will show up soon.\n\nI tested the palm thing with Fancy. She rode on top of my hand, a disembodied head.  Fortunately, she shrank to 50%.\n\nWhen I just waved my palm parallel to the floor, she was barely visible.  When I tried to \"feel\" for heat, she got noticeably brighter.\n\nThere was a 2 second delay, but that's a very fast response for an IOB.  10 second delays are common for requests.\n\nI tried this over and over, and each time she got brighter, or dimmer, depending on whether I was emphasizing \"feeling\".\n\nBut I was far far into heightened awareness, so who knows exactly how I was emphasizing it.  I suspect it was in a way not available at our current position of the assemblage point.\n\nAnd Fancy showed me a story.\n\nDon't ask me how. It's almost like she can move over to one spot, and trigger you to start thinking about a specific topic.

My assemblage point wasn&amp;#39;t in an ideal position to make her as solid and real as in those pictures, so instead she rode on my hand. But the fact that she wasn&amp;#39;t perfectly formed, and was usually dim, made a good tool. I could see what gave her more energy. She was right on the &amp;quot;sweet spot&amp;quot; for noticing when she got a tiny bit more energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned far more than I can explain.  But I&amp;#39;ll try:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gremlin or weird substance which gives off wonderful feelings is precisely what the IOBs want.  They&amp;#39;re after the same thing we are!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, that&amp;#39;s part of what we want. They don&amp;#39;t have the burden of imminent death from old age, so they don&amp;#39;t worry about &amp;quot;escaping to freedom&amp;quot;, an obsession of ours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they do love those &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot; coming from the second attention.  Same as we do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not that specific one (the Gremlin), who is significantly more intense than the &amp;quot;bliss&amp;quot; you get in heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when we say they are after &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot;, like fear, we have to realize that &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot; is a vast world, and we&amp;#39;ve been banned from most of it by our internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Nagual Julian was said to be able to control them very well by dolling out his feelings.  It&amp;#39;s hard to picture how you could do that, unless you take into account that the 8 point diagram includes &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot;.  Julian was undoubtedly using feelings in a manner we don&amp;#39;t understand yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what about &amp;quot;emotions&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emotions is the socialized version of feelings. It&amp;#39;s tied to the internal dialogue.  But if you think about asking a young person what they love to do most in life, in a &amp;quot;safe setting&amp;quot;, maybe with a couple of glasses of wine in them, they&amp;#39;ll admit sex is what they crave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sex is the sharing of feelings.  That&amp;#39;s what  the IOBs want from us too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not just to feel the feeling. But to feel it with someone else. It increases the richness of the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we need to remember that the vast world of feelings is a lot more complicated than our simple world of sex, pain, hunger, and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don  Juan gave us a demo of how it looks, to feed them some &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot;,  in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s said he contorted his face and had an odd look of surprise.  Then the Little Smoke showed up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d be making a mistake if we interpreted what he was doing with our normal, very limited understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled aside Fancy&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;cloak&amp;quot; again, and Fancy went in there and swam around.  She was trying to show me which feelings you could find in there, using facial expressions and how intense or well formed she was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t recall it.  I suppose she was trying to teach me using that center of perception, &amp;quot;feelings&amp;quot;.  Otherwise, all she has available with which to interact with us,  is &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt;.  Maybe &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt;, but who knows at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The technique for finding your own Ally, given in an early book, consists of waving the palm slowly, parallel to the ground, for a whole 180 degrees. Then you turn around and do it for the other 180 degrees. In that manner you span everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you feel heat in the hand, you run in that direction for a certain distance, and then continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually you&amp;#39;ll find your &amp;quot;ally&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all feelings!  Rather than thinking you find the Ally by looking for heat, it&amp;#39;s more like you lure the Ally, the same way you can in dreaming by looking from object to object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They notice that.  Maybe in dreaming, it&amp;#39;s actually the thrill of succeeding, rather than looking at the object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When using the palm technique, you are radiating &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; from your hand. If you find a hot spot, you just detected something from the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s essentially the same as Lucid dreaming, where you lure a scout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or as we&amp;#39;ve seen, waking dreaming.  Once you find a few puffs that are vivid, IOBs will show up soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tested the palm thing with Fancy. She rode on top of my hand, a disembodied head.  Fortunately, she shrank to 50%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I just waved my palm parallel to the floor, she was barely visible.  When I tried to &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; for heat, she got noticeably brighter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a 2 second delay, but that&amp;#39;s a very fast response for an IOB.  10 second delays are common for requests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried this over and over, and each time she got brighter, or dimmer, depending on whether I was emphasizing &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was far far into heightened awareness, so who knows exactly how I was emphasizing it.  I suspect it was in a way not available at our current position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Fancy showed me a story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t ask me how. It&amp;#39;s almost like she can move over to one spot, and trigger you to start thinking about a specific topic.  Then watching your reaction to that, she can fine tune it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until you get an idea yourself, but it&amp;#39;s such a strange idea, you have to assume she induced it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a story about 2 small ships rushing down a dangerous river.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each captain had a &amp;quot;map&amp;quot; of the river.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One captain&amp;#39;s map was simply Carlos Castaneda&amp;#39;s books.

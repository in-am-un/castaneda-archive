Her eyes had been opened.\n\nWe were driving down the 405 a little too fast, the back seats were loaded with organic produce from Whole Foods, it was very dark, and her claim that her eyes were now open made me miss the dimly lit turnoff.\n\nWe ended up taking a different route, adding a 10 minute delay to get back home.\n\nThat was good, because she'd suddenly become very chatty about private classes. It's been a good week where Cholita won't even talk to me more than 10 seconds a day.\n\nI wanted to ask the most important question an apprentice could ever ask, if he wants to understand the teaching process hidden deep inside sorcery groups.\n\n\"Who was fucking whom?\", I asked her.\n\nOften that would get her started on a long list of class participants.\n\nBut this time she chastised me for forgetting one of the most important points. The lizards.\n\nShe even began to taunt me, like a grade school kid chanting a nanny nanny goat sing song.\n\n\u201cYou forgot the lizards, you forgot the lizards!!!\u201d, she sang.\n\n\"What lizards???\", I asked. I was feeling a little impatient and figured this was some internet theory about the lizard mind, or alien lizard people who secretly control the government.\n\nShe replied, \"You know, the 2 lizards sitting on his shoulders. He had to listen to each one. He showed us in class. Don't you remember? He had a real problem...\"\n\nI pictured cartoons from the 50s and 60s where Satan and an Angel are sitting on someone's shoulders, giving them conflicting advice.\n\nAnd all of a sudden it became easy to superimpose Carlos' face in that cartoon. I could actually see him turning his head back and forth, showing us how he had been trying to decide who to listen to.\n\nAs crazy as it sounds, I DID remember that.  He even managed to make each lizard\u2019s conflicting advice very funny.\n\nBut when did that happen?\n\nIt was so strange that I mentioned it to someone who writes to me, and has reached a very advanced level.\n\nHis reaction was equally as puzzling. \u201cShit!!!\u201d, he wrote to me. \u201cI dreamt about those damned lizards last night. They were giving me hell!\u201d\n\nHe's able to control dreams to the point of bouncing between them, so if the lizards were giving him hell, those weren't ordinary dreaming phantoms.\n\nHe started to get a little paranoid and asked what else Cholita could do?\n\nI checked in Carlos\u2019 books to see if there was a clue. I remembered only one lizard, who had his eyes sewn shut.  He was indirectly associated with one of don Juan\u2019s 2 allies.\n\nJust for fun, I reminded Cholita that we now had access to 2 allies, probably don Juan's,  and since no one else from private classes would even believe that statement, that means we sort of own them.\n\nShe became very angry and asked if I\u2019d remembered to tell the one that lives under the house to stop making so much noise?\n\nShe had in fact asked that the day before. She came running out of her bedroom during the night, insisting I had to get a flashlight and go down there and tell him to stop it.\n\nI dug up info on lizards from Carlos' books, surprised that I had in fact forgotten there were 2.\n\nHere\u2019s the \u201cinspirational\u201d quote.\n\nI'll add that *divination* as Carlos calls it, is rather simple.\n\nYou think a thought, then return to silence. And wait. That's all.\n\nWe don't have the ability to do something like that.  And the inorganic beings are pretty unresponsive.\n\nBut our Nagual can do it.  You just put the idea out there, and see what comes of it.\n\nIf you can't get silent, power plants can move your assemblage point too.\n\nYou don\u2019t always get what you want, but you\u2019d be surprised how well it works.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"We returned to his room where there were still two little sacks he had not touched. He opened one, slid his hand inside, and wrinkled the open end around his wrist with the other hand. He seemed to be holding something, judging by the way his hand moved inside the bag. Suddenly, with a swift movement, he peeled the bag off his hand like a glove, turning it inside out, and shoved his hand close to my face. He was holding a lizard. Its head was a few inches from my eyes. There was something strange about the lizard's mouth. I gazed at it for a moment, and then recoiled involuntarily. The lizard's mouth was sewed up with rude stitches. Don Juan ordered me to hold the lizard in my left hand. I clutched it; it wriggled against my palm. I felt nauseated. My hands began to perspire.\n\nHe took the last bag, and, repeating the same motions, he extracted another lizard. He also held it close to my face. I saw that its eyelids were sewed together. He ordered me to hold this lizard in my right hand. By the time I had both lizards in my hands I was almost sick. I had an overpowering desire to drop them and get out of there.\n\n\"Don't squeeze them!\" he said, and his voice brought me a sense of relief and direction. He asked what was wrong with me. He tried to be serious, but couldn't keep a straight face and laughed. I tried to easy my grip, but my hands were sweating so profusely that the lizards began to wriggle out of them. Their sharp little claws scratched my hands, producing an incredible feeling of disgust and nausea. I closed my eyes and clenched my teeth. One of the lizards was already sliding onto my wrist; all it needed was to yank its head from between my fingers to be free. I had a peculiar sensation of physical despair, of supreme discomfort. I growled at don Juan, between my teeth, to take the damn things off me. My head shook involuntarily. He looked at me curiously. I growled like a bear, shaking my body. He dropped the lizards into their bags and began to laugh. I wanted to laugh also, but my stomach was upset. I lay down.\n\nI explained to him that what had affected me was the sensation of their claws on my palms; he said there were lots of things that could drive a man mad, especially if he did not have the resolution, the purpose, required for learning; but when a man had a clear, unbending intent, feelings were in no way a hindrance, for he was capable of controlling them.\n\nDon Juan waited awhile and then, going through the same motions, handed me the lizards again. He told me to hold their heads up and rub them softly against my temples, as I asked them anything I wanted to know. I did not understand at first what he wanted me to do. He told me again to ask the lizards about anything I could not find out for myself. He gave me a whole series of examples: I could find out about persons I did not see ordinarily, or about objects that were lost, or about places I had not seen. Then I realized he was talking about divination. I got very excited. My heart began to pound. I felt that I was losing my breath.\"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A Suggestion From Cholita", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Cholita"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 48, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ofjz4clmfqv31": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 37, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ofjz4clmfqv31.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe5962ef2687f7d81968a46eb64631ae98d1da62"}, {"y": 75, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ofjz4clmfqv31.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c04e1777af061f80706ec6794d5e6d7a0415dedb"}, {"y": 111, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ofjz4clmfqv31.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35ca8e6991498f2d189f7e9681d935f1339feb9a"}], "s": {"y": 136, "x": 390, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ofjz4clmfqv31.jpg?width=390&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eb61d40ce59eaf74eae632b4ea1a16a69b12de2"}, "id": "ofjz4clmfqv31"}}, "name": "t3_dpbjxp", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Cholita", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/CVgT4p1cqc03KMUcRXT7QR5vzrZlZM3djXrieWu5Ko0.jpg", "edited": 1572471313.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1572464022.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ofjz4clmfqv31.jpg?width=390&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2eb61d40ce59eaf74eae632b4ea1a16a69b12de2\"&gt;Chosen in Honor of Carlos&amp;#39; Cognitive Dissonance Duck joke.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita was talking about Carlos last night, saying that while I&amp;#39;d forgotten nearly everything, it was all coming back to &lt;strong&gt;her&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She could see it all!

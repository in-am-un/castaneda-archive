I finally decided, he was a \"teacher type\" bad player.  I suspect he was impressed with the magic in the Instagram pictures, and since he couldn't top that he pointed to another phony teacher, so he could pass on his \"wisdom\" to us  through someone else.  \n\nLike, \"Oh yea????   My dad can beat up your dad!\"\n\nFor the teacher type, it's all about passing on their specialness.  Unfortunately, they never have an actual interest in learning.  That takes work.\n\nI can't comprehend why people don't know the difference between fraud, or at the very least, impotence, and sheer magic right in your face.  I see that on my Facebook feed. There's a former cleargreen insider who looks at it.  I was happy he was there until I realized, he's everywhere.  I found him on a \"Nagual Julian\" Facebook page, where the owner claims he only shows up to add to his page,  on magical occasions as needed.  By some form of \"specialness telepathy\".\n\nIt was about as horrific as you could imagine, when it comes to fakers. And that cleargreen insider was also over there, cheering that guy on.\n\nHaving thought about it far too much, angering both Fancy and Mystery over the wasted time (internal dialogue eruptions), here are some reasons frauds like Sergio manage to fool people.\n\n\\# 1 :  The books are just entertainment to most people.  And they like to read anything else about it, even if it's fraudulent.   Like \"True Crime\" magazine. It's not really true crime, but people still buy it.  For the fantasies it contains.\n\nDiscussing whether it's fraudulent, whether another pretend Nagual has new helpful tips, and what is the history behind what they are saying, is what some people are after.  \n\nNot sorcery.  Inventory, to share with friends.\n\n\\# 2 : People are used to pretend magic. That's all there is out there!  It's one reason magic is so hated at this point in our civilization.    It's dominated to 99.9999% by fakers.  Anyone who maintains an interest in magic has already accepted that.   And probably, they want to get in on the pretending.\n\n\\# 3 : There's a LOT of mental illness in the Castaneda community.  Mental illness often simulates the effects of magic.

It triggers the sense that you absolutely know something, when in fact it's false.    And the delusions are typically self-serving, so some might sincerely believe they found magic in another author, even if the person is obvious scum.\n\nCholita story:  She has schizophrenia, and hides all the time now.

I finally decided, he was a &amp;quot;teacher type&amp;quot; bad player.  I suspect he was impressed with the magic in the Instagram pictures, and since he couldn&amp;#39;t top that he pointed to another phony teacher, so he could pass on his &amp;quot;wisdom&amp;quot; to us  through someone else.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, &amp;quot;Oh yea????   My dad can beat up your dad!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the teacher type, it&amp;#39;s all about passing on their specialness.  Unfortunately, they never have an actual interest in learning.  That takes work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t comprehend why people don&amp;#39;t know the difference between fraud, or at the very least, impotence, and sheer magic right in your face.  I see that on my Facebook feed. There&amp;#39;s a former cleargreen insider who looks at it.  I was happy he was there until I realized, he&amp;#39;s everywhere.  I found him on a &amp;quot;Nagual Julian&amp;quot; Facebook page, where the owner claims he only shows up to add to his page,  on magical occasions as needed.  By some form of &amp;quot;specialness telepathy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was about as horrific as you could imagine, when it comes to fakers. And that cleargreen insider was also over there, cheering that guy on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having thought about it far too much, angering both Fancy and Mystery over the wasted time (internal dialogue eruptions), here are some reasons frauds like Sergio manage to fool people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;# 1 :  The books are just entertainment to most people.  And they like to read anything else about it, even if it&amp;#39;s fraudulent.   Like &amp;quot;True Crime&amp;quot; magazine. It&amp;#39;s not really true crime, but people still buy it.  For the fantasies it contains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Discussing whether it&amp;#39;s fraudulent, whether another pretend Nagual has new helpful tips, and what is the history behind what they are saying, is what some people are after.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not sorcery.  Inventory, to share with friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;# 2 : People are used to pretend magic. That&amp;#39;s all there is out there!  It&amp;#39;s one reason magic is so hated at this point in our civilization.    It&amp;#39;s dominated to 99.9999% by fakers.  Anyone who maintains an interest in magic has already accepted that.

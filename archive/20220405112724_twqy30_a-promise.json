If you can't repay it, try something else.\n\nRecap won't make you feel good about past turmoil, doing an event a few times.  It doesn't \"remove\" things.\n\nBut it can cause you to get tired of having to recapitulate it over and over, until you are \"sick of that topic\".  And \"understand\" it much better.\n\nThat frees most of the lost energy.\n\nYou can literally SEE THIS in the darkroom, at advanced stages.  You can both find, and track, and enter, past events that have tied up your energy.\n\nSorcerers are not given to fantasy, as other \"systems\" are.  Everything they do is based on having actually seen that, and knowing what other sorcerers did to fix bad situations.\n\nIt's real technology, not make believe.\n\nIf it's a debt in your past, those are serious.\n\nYou can't \"recapitulate a debt\".\n\nOnly the feelings about it.\n\nYou need to repay debts, to fully free that energy.\n\nIn the case of Carlos for example, Joanie Baker lived at his compound up until his death.  In a little \"granny shack\" just above the driveway on the right side of the main house.  He probably kept her around all these years because she started him on the path to finding don Juan.  It was a debt.\n\nCarlos went out of his way to get me to shake hands with Joanie. She was \"disheveled\" in the middle of the day, and had just gotten out of bed.  Probably Carlos was pointing out to me, I had a connection to Joanie also, from my association with Morongo.  I was too young then to pay attention to such things.\n\nAs best I can make out, when you die and face the eagle and want to \"sneak around\" him, you don't necessarily take \"all\" of your energy.\n\nCholita says, you make a copy of yourself and the Eagle takes that instead of you. Which implies, the copy might not be complete, and the eagle might end up stopping an actual piece of the real thing from escaping.\n\nWeird theory: If you don't \"recapitulate\" your \"stories\", the Eagle does it for you.  But then it's too late to sneak away.  He doesn't want your awareness, just the memories.  Which \"frees\" it from the emanations.  Maybe any stuff you didn't recap, isn't freed soon enough to \"go with you\"?\n\nIf you never recapitulated, but somehow found a way to sneak around him, possibly because you learned to travel into the second attention but were too lazy to do a recap, you might not be able to take all of your awareness.  Some might get \"stuck\" and not go with you.  Maybe you only take the awareness of the double in the worst such case.\n\nYou could end up a \"50% copy of yourself\" as far as awareness goes.\n\nWe know this is likely so because Carlos asked don Juan to take him with their group when they left.  Don Juan said he could certainly do that, but that the loses to Carlos would be incalculable.\n\nThat was in 1973, so he was far from a \"finished\" sorcerer.\n\nAnd so while we don't have anyone in authority to say this is absolutely true, I firmly believe you could \"leave\" and lose some of your energy of awareness because it just won't go with you.\n\nIt's flowing through emanations, and not free to be removed.\n\nA debt is likely a HUGE source of trapped awareness, or else sorcerers would not take paying back debts so seriously.", "edited": 1649167443.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i3hojgw", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recapitulation will do it, but if you have a debt, you need to solve it.

I was too young then to pay attention to such things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As best I can make out, when you die and face the eagle and want to &amp;quot;sneak around&amp;quot; him, you don&amp;#39;t necessarily take &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; of your energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita says, you make a copy of yourself and the Eagle takes that instead of you. Which implies, the copy might not be complete, and the eagle might end up stopping an actual piece of the real thing from escaping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weird theory: If you don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;recapitulate&amp;quot; your &amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;, the Eagle does it for you.  But then it&amp;#39;s too late to sneak away.  He doesn&amp;#39;t want your awareness, just the memories.  Which &amp;quot;frees&amp;quot; it from the emanations.  Maybe any stuff you didn&amp;#39;t recap, isn&amp;#39;t freed soon enough to &amp;quot;go with you&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you never recapitulated, but somehow found a way to sneak around him, possibly because you learned to travel into the second attention but were too lazy to do a recap, you might not be able to take all of your awareness.  Some might get &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; and not go with you.  Maybe you only take the awareness of the double in the worst such case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could end up a &amp;quot;50% copy of yourself&amp;quot; as far as awareness goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know this is likely so because Carlos asked don Juan to take him with their group when they left.  Don Juan said he could certainly do that, but that the loses to Carlos would be incalculable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was in 1973, so he was far from a &amp;quot;finished&amp;quot; sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so while we don&amp;#39;t have anyone in authority to say this is absolutely true, I firmly believe you could &amp;quot;leave&amp;quot; and lose some of your energy of awareness because it just won&amp;#39;t go with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s flowing through emanations, and not free to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A debt is likely a HUGE source of trapped awareness, or else sorcerers would not take paying back debts so seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/twqy30/a_promise/i3hojgw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1649167181.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_twqy30", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i3he88m", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "davidoffwhite", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1649162461.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i3gxt4b", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_jh8vy3km", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Thank you", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i3he88m", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_twqy30", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/twqy30/a_promise/i3he88m/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1649162461.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i3gxt4b", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "plateaupus4", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1649151842.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_twqy30", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_i8cl21le", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Are you looking for just how to be more comfortable with existing as you currently think you do?

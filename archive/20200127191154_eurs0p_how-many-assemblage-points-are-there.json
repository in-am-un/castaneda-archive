Your reason at this point might even admit that there is another center of assemblage, the *will*, through which it is possible to judge or assess and use the extraordinary effects of the *nagual*. It has finally dawned on your reason that one can reflect the *nagual* through the *will*, although one can never explain it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've tricked your reason into believing that the *tonal* was accountable and predictable. Genaro and I have labored to give you the impression that only the *nagual* was beyond the scope of explanation; the proof that the tricking was successful is that at this moment it seems to you that in spite of everything you have gone through, there is still a core that you can claim as your own, your reason. That's a mirage.\n\nYour precious reason is only a center of assemblage, a mirror that reflects something which is outside of it. Last night you witnessed not only the indescribable *nagual* but also the indescribable *tonal.\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Eagles\u2019 Gift:**\n\nI disregarded Zuleica's order to enter into a patch of coloration that was forming right at my eye level, and gave myself fully to the exploration of that strange sensation outside me. Zuleica must have *seen* what I was going through; she suddenly began to explain that the second attention belongs to the luminous body, as the first attention belongs to the physical body. The point where, she said, the second attention assembles itself was situated right where Juan Tuma had described it the first time we met - approximately one and one-half feet in front of the midpoint between the stomach and the belly button and four inches to the right.\n\nZuleica ordered me to massage that place, to manipulate it by moving the fingers of both my hands right on that point as if I were playing a harp. She assured me that sooner or later I would end up feeling my fingers going through something as thick as water, and that finally I would feel my luminous shell.\n\nAs I kept on moving my fingers the air got progressively thicker until I felt a mass of sorts. An undefined physical pleasure spread all over me. I thought that I was touching a nerve in my body and felt silly at the absurdity of it. I stopped.\n\nZuleica warned me that if I did not move my fingers she was going to bop me on the head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here\u2019s some good news, seeing as how we have a working method to use, to get to heightened awareness (thanks to Zuleica):**\n\n\"Genaro has something to tell you,\" don Juan said. \"I've told you that he is the master of awareness. Now I can tell you what all that means. He can make the assemblage point move deeper into the luminous egg after that point has been jolted out of its position by the Nagual's blow.\"\n\nHe explained that Genaro had pushed my assemblage point countless times after I had attained heightened awareness. The day we had gone to the gigantic flat rock to talk, Genaro had made my assemblage point move dramatically into the left side - so dramatically, in fact, that it had been a bit dangerous.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here\u2019s something worth remembering:**\n\nHe made a diagram on a small blackboard. He drew an egg-like shape and divided it in four longitudinal sections, saying that he would immediately erase the division lines because he had drawn them only to give me an idea where the band was located in the cocoon of man. He then drew a thick band at the line between the first and second sections and erased the division lines.\n\nHe explained that the band was like a disk of cheddar cheese that had been inserted into the ball of jack cheese. \"Now if that ball of jack cheese were transparent,\" he went on, \"you would have the perfect replica of man's cocoon. The cheddar cheese goes all the way inside the ball of jack cheese. It's a disk that goes from the surface on one side to the surface on the other side.\n\n\"The assemblage point of man is located high up, three-fourths of the way toward the top of the egg on the surface of the cocoon. When a nagual presses on that point of intense luminosity, the point moves into the disk of the cheddar cheese. Heightened awareness comes about when the intense glow of the assemblage point lights up dormant emanations way inside the disk of cheddar cheese. To *see* the glow of the assemblage point moving inside that disk gives the feeling that it is shifting toward the left on the surface of the cocoon.\"\n\nHe repeated his analogy three or four times, but I did not understand it and he had to explain it further. He said that the transparency of the luminous egg creates the impression of a movement toward the left, when in fact every movement of the assemblage point is in depth, into the center of the luminous egg along the thickness of man's band.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**And at the risk of being accused of nagging:**\n\n\u201cWhile we were having lunch the next day, don Juan said that Genaro had pushed my assemblage point with his gait of power, and that he had been able to do that because I had been in a state of inner silence. He explained that the articulation point of everything seers do is something he had talked about since the day we met: stopping the internal dialogue. He stressed over and over that the internal dialogue is what keeps the assemblage point fixed to its original position.\n\n\"Once silence is attained, everything is possible,\" he said.\u201d\n\nI asked him to explain the act of walking the assemblage point. He said that once warriors have attained inner silence by stopping their internal dialogue, the sound of the gait of power, more than the sight of it, is what traps their assemblage points. The rhythm of muffled steps instantly catches the alignment force of the emanations inside the cocoon, which has been disconnected by inner silence\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**And a reminder of who \"the fliers\" probably are:**\n\n\"I was talking about what happens to human beings when they are infants,\" he replied, \"a time when they are taught by everyone around them to repeat an endless dialogue about themselves. The dialogue becomes internalized, and that force alone keeps the assemblage point fixed. \"The new seers say that infants have hundreds of teachers who teach them exactly where to place their assemblage point.\"\n\nHe said that seers *see* that infants have no fixed assemblage point at first. Their encased emanations are in a state of great turmoil, and their assemblage points shift everywhere in the band of man, giving children a great capacity to focus on emanations that later will be thoroughly disregarded. Then as they grow, the older humans around them, through their considerable power over them, force the children's assemblage points to become more steady by means of an increasingly complex internal dialogue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The value of Cholita**:\n\nHe looked at me with shiny eyes and laughed. \"Female seers have downshifts more often than males,\" he said. \"But they are also capable of bouncing out of that position with no effort at all, while males linger dangerously in it.\"\n\nHe also said that women seers have an extraordinary capacity to make their assemblage points hold on to any position in the area below. Men cannot. Men have sobriety and purpose, but very little talent; that is the reason why a nagual must have eight women seers in his party. Women give the impulse to cross the immeasurable vastness of the unknown. Together with that natural capacity, or as a consequence of it, women have a most fierce intensity. They can, therefore, reproduce an animal form with flare, ease, and a matchless ferocity.\n\n\"If you think about scary things,\" he continued, \"about something unnameable lurking in the darkness, you're thinking, without knowing it, about a woman seer holding a position in the immeasurable area below. True horror lies right there. If you ever find an aberrant woman seer, run for the hills!\"\n\nI had to admit that somehow I had always found la Catalina to be a very scary but at the same time an extremely appealing woman. What impressed me the most about her was her exuding energy.\n\n\"She has so much energy saved,\" don Juan commented, \"that you didn't have to be in heightened awareness for her to move your assemblage point all the way to the depths of the left side.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Practical Advice:**\n\nYou MUST learn what it feels like when the assemblage point moves, so that all of the nonsense I\u2019ve quoted above, no longer seems made up! Tensegrity moves it, but not fast enough at once to notice. People report feeling a little tingly, or a good kind of energy like the rest after doing yoga.\n\nBut that\u2019s not very convincing. The most convincing way to learn about the assemblage point is with The \u201cSimple Silence Technique\u201d. The reason for this is, your internal dialogue resumes, and subsides  constantly as you practice, until the point comes when the assemblage point is loosened up enough to make a fast movement.\n\nThe fast movement is VERY noticeable.  At first you'll pass out, but eventually you can linger in the feeling of the movement.\n\nSaturate yourself with such movements and you\u2019ll realize Carlos wasn\u2019t making up the assemblage point.\n\nYou can **say** you realize that already, but you almost certainly don\u2019t until you learn to be silent.\n\nHow do you know that?  Just go talk to the Castaneda \"practitioners\" out there. If they're secretive, hostile, and cagey, they're absolute frauds.\n\nCarlos was light-hearted, funny, and giving.\n\nRude even, but not angry.\n\nA real sorcerer seems like he must have a secret cave with endless treasures hidden in it,  and he's just playing along with everyone, as if he were poor too.\n\nHe does.\n\nEdited", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How Many Assemblage Points Are There?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 95, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"4b9l0ekyckd41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 73, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4b9l0ekyckd41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43f99326921dcccbbbbb7419840fe88cf2954367"}, {"y": 147, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4b9l0ekyckd41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68e3427a2f160a2e83a968d59e45119439fc177f"}, {"y": 218, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4b9l0ekyckd41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b661c5f39fe4fad54c2e2c3bbfa32209624705bf"}, {"y": 436, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4b9l0ekyckd41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb142ba4e2d0e7038eed217c95f4ff15d25b4bae"}], "s": {"y": 553, "x": 811, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4b9l0ekyckd41.jpg?width=811&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7ee9afedce50b23101ee319cfebcd8c195ab5a5"}, "id": "4b9l0ekyckd41"}}, "name": "t3_eurs0p", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/IvLPUkXPPXny4C56Kd6dNjmqEw5X8GWNlOn5aV1gYiI.jpg", "edited": 1580236571.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1580148714.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4b9l0ekyckd41.jpg?width=811&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c7ee9afedce50b23101ee319cfebcd8c195ab5a5\"&gt;Carlos shows why a movement in depth looks like a move to the left.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tales of Power:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Those leaps were only the beginning,&amp;quot; he went on. &amp;quot;Then came your true excursion into the unknown; last night you experienced the unspeakable, the &lt;em&gt;nagual.&lt;/em&gt; Your reason cannot fight the physical knowledge that you are a nameless cluster of feelings.

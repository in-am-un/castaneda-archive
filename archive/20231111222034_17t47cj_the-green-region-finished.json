So if you start threatening it, all kinds of sensations might occur.\n\nI mean, the very least and easiest to notice is that your jaw actually mouths the words you are thinking to yourself, at times.\n\nWe've be severely traumatized I suppose.   Or Jedi mind trick controlled by the fliers.\n\nWe even get the stomach ache later in the orange zone, when the breath is about to change.\n\nThat's possibly what holds \"self\" in place for some.  A nervous stomach ache, maybe from perpetually tensing those muscles.\n\nThe green zone is known for the first breath change (a little) from the worst form of breathing, lifting the shoulders, to a slightly better breathing method of puffing out the chest instead.\n\nLater in the orange only the low stomach moves in and out.

The real world is just vast and empty from its point of view.\n\nNot \"cozy\".\n\nIt's a protection mechanism, so naturally when you try to get rid of it, it's uncomfortable about that and you feel pity, and stop trying to get rid of it.\n\nSo in some ways, any physical \"stress relief\" symptoms are more like that fetal position \"being\" grabbing onto your legs and squeezing hard, refusing to be sent away.\n\nI really need to animate this!\n\nIt's so easy to confuse \"getting rid of the idea of self\", with \"egoless\".\n\nCertainly Cleargreen has made that serious mistake.\n\n\"Egoless\" is just manipulation of the idea of self to make yourself feel and seem superior, to groupies.\n\nVery much an Asian social order concept void of any real magic.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_k9ccszx", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, our imaginary idea of a &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; is driven by anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;#39;s like a frightened version of yourself curled up in a fetal position, going over and over words in its mind trying to uphold its feeling of being safe or effective or well treated in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An endless pointless loop of tossing the same words back at itself.

You&amp;#39;ll just make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s effects are still there up in the green zone. So if you start threatening it, all kinds of sensations might occur.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, the very least and easiest to notice is that your jaw actually mouths the words you are thinking to yourself, at times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve be severely traumatized I suppose.   Or Jedi mind trick controlled by the fliers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We even get the stomach ache later in the orange zone, when the breath is about to change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s possibly what holds &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; in place for some.  A nervous stomach ache, maybe from perpetually tensing those muscles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The green zone is known for the first breath change (a little) from the worst form of breathing, lifting the shoulders, to a slightly better breathing method of puffing out the chest instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later in the orange only the low stomach moves in and out.  Reducing tension all over the torso.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the green zone we also have &amp;quot;weird tension&amp;quot; holding our &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; in place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a 3 year old tensing their fists out of anger their older sibling is getting more attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we do isn&amp;#39;t fake magic like Yoga or Buddhism, where everything is wonderful and it&amp;#39;s never unpleasant if you do it &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although even they run into problems with students, since they do in fact get to the green zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll say it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;stress relief&amp;quot; to put a positive spin on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s more like, that fetal position version of yourself repeating words over and over like it was praying, doesn&amp;#39;t want to let go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you can &amp;quot;mess with it&amp;quot; directly, you can see that it starts to look around and finds nothing to soothe itself in the real world.   The real world is just vast and empty from its point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a protection mechanism, so naturally when you try to get rid of it, it&amp;#39;s uncomfortable about that and you feel pity, and stop trying to get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in some ways, any physical &amp;quot;stress relief&amp;quot; symptoms are more like that fetal position &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; grabbing onto your legs and squeezing hard, refusing to be sent away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really need to animate this!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so easy to confuse &amp;quot;getting rid of the idea of self&amp;quot;, with &amp;quot;egoless&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly Cleargreen has made that serious mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Egoless&amp;quot; is just manipulation of the idea of self to make yourself feel and seem superior, to groupies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very much an Asian social order concept void of any real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_17t47cj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/17t47cj/the_green_region_finished/k9ccszx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1700047273.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1700047273.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k9aa97y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "lukout8", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_k8x6pgf", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_klk263a5n", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Can anxiety manifest in the physical body as the AP moves down the back, in what looks like the green zone?

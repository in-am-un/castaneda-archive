I&amp;#39;m afraid to say, the fastest way for a &amp;quot;Nagual&amp;quot; to make witches, is to exchange some emanations with them.    Embed some of those strands in them.  He did that with Cholita, giving her more control over spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos got hell when he died,  over how he dealt with women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t do what he did. The theory is, he&amp;#39;s like Julian, the previous nagual teacher, before his teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That guy was a pervert!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it is a more effective way to help women learn sorcery, than talking endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My method...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for your progress, trying to find the &amp;quot;Middle ground&amp;quot; between dozing off and &amp;quot;catching it halfway&amp;quot;, is the fastest path to the second attention that I know of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides someone grabbing you by the neck, and hurling you through the wall of fog.

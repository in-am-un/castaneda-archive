He gave me the book after I offered him my whole collection of books plus cash for the book I was inquiring. it was a real sacrifice really but sacrifices is what life is about.

No one can really say casteneda is this. Castaneda knows himself better one thing for sure is Castaneda existed and he wrote books. His books on the other hand are books written with a lot of correct codes for example one sentence could hold a book worth of meanings that\u2019s what I mean. so no one can really say casteneda books are in a definite way of their beliefs other than \"It was a helpful great book\".\n\n\nSo the practices I interpret them as ways to create a one degree of separation between worlds allowing you to be free to a different reality by the ways and serious attempts designed by sorcerers of ancient Mexico who were far advanced. Before you can understand sorcery you need to know what a warrior is because only an impeccable warrior can be a sorcerer meaning every sorcerer is a warrior but every warrior is NOT a sorcerer. So sorcery can not have a definition or description actually it breaks description so that\u2019s why it\u2019s called sorcery. \n\nI personally don\u2019t think it needs a name but the rules of this reality forces a name upon it because other wise it would be hard to have interactions with others who are following the rules.\n\nTensegrity the modified version to fit everyone is called Tensional integrity or tensegrity. It isn\u2019t modified a lot just a little because magical passes or tensegrity were assigned to one specific person by those impeccable SORCERERs only but thanks to Castaneda and cleargreen it\u2019s available for anyone willing to try.\n\nWith casteneda books the mystical thing you may find is what you choose to find because the books are codes that are correctly assembled to relay a message of possibilities that aren\u2019t written in other books that I know of. The whole thing is mystical for your liking. And very real.\n\nYou can be a practitioner but telling people you are, defeats the purpose because it is sacred. you would rather prefer to seem ordinary to gain an upper hand instead of seeking attention from people. Also because it\u2019s very available be careful in treating it as just practice it really triggers something inside of you. It can shatter your reality if your willing to practice sorcery which at its lesser form is magic. your at the right place if you\u2019re serious.\n\nThe books really help if you understand them I spent about a week on one page at one time trying my best to really understand so, you can choose whichever of the 12 books and read whatever you\u2019re drawn to. If you\u2019re serious Make the books your friend. Even if you\u2019re really really committed you can take plant medicine to gain a deeper connection just like in the books. \n\nI stopped buying casteneda books after I found them free online but the radiation will bother you because you will have to pause to dwell on the meaning behind the words and a lot. But there are audiobooks so idk if that\u2019s interesting but it\u2019s surely easy. But rewinding things will bother a bit considering you\u2019ll be forced to rewind multiple times.\n\nLastly  I doubt any book can top these books in my book reading experience \nAnd also if you decide to read and learn stuff then please don\u2019t Steal Castaneda stuff and say you found out by yourself or try to sell stuff from the book like a lot of people and make profit it\u2019s so shameful and it will become a big enemy and a hindrance.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me it all started when I had a neighbor (for a short time only) who had tons of book.

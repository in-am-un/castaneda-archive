She plays dumb if asked, but blue jays torn in half appearing and disappearing twice on our front lawn, right after shouting warnings to you a few days before, kind of remove the potency of denials.\n\nAnd I can't recall being attacked by skunks in the past. This one actually chased me a while.\n\nIt only gave up when I calmly asked it what it was doing.\n\nI was happy that it backed off, or I might have run it over and found out it was quite capable of knocking me off the bike. I arrived around 50 feet away, relieved, and looked back to see why the skunk had behaved so oddly.\n\nBut it had vanished.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThere's a lesson in this:\n\nDon't expect to become \"wise\" as a sorcerer.\n\nIf that's what you're expecting, you're not going to like it when you actually get there.\n\nWanting to become a \"wise sorcerer\" is the book deal mind, at its worst.\n\nTake a lesson from Carlos, who towards the end was worried that the world of the old seers was going to \"swallow him up\".\n\nThe old seers had no problem with magical skunks. They'd just shapeshift into werejaguars, and hunt them down.\n\nBy the way, an odd \"coincidence\".\n\nAs I was just getting my electric bike out the front door at 4:20AM, Cholita decided to show up.\n\nShe's paranoid about my car not being in the driveway each night.  I suspect since she has no place else to live, as far as I know, she worries about anything different.\n\nSo the side door to the house flew open just as I was lifting the bike down, and Cholita swooped by.\n\nI only saw her for a second, moving in a clockwise arch of around 90 degrees.\n\nThat's the exact same movement the attacking skunk made.\n\nCholita's lent me \"blocks\" of energy before in that manner.\n\nOnce she froze up like a statue so I could examine her as long as I liked, and then a few hours later I was examining statues made out the abstract, during darkroom. For perhaps a full hour.  Hard to judge time in \"the abstract\".\n\nCarol Tiggs lent me a block of energy once, and I fell into the entrance to the inorganic being's world. Clear as anything, right through the floor of dance home, and down into a perfect dirt tunnel that Elon Musk might have cut down there.\n\nWomen can \"toss\" or \"push\" blocks of energy your way.\n\nI'm not sure they even have to decide what that's going to produce.\n\nThey just send it your way, and the results happen later.\n\nI believe that's why Rosendo gathered 5 witches for the Nagual Elias, before he took him into his lineage.\n\nElias had the energetic resources of 5 women right from the start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Killer Skunks!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"q52ql89rcwgb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q52ql89rcwgb1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89042033b1fa114ae5aebd06de7cce5549d90d79"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q52ql89rcwgb1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b6b171a2f2a874c74e9c78c247858c48afb3255"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q52ql89rcwgb1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3481ef32ed0ccb4f9b081ade93d30140c841019"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q52ql89rcwgb1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e6cc2321803fc4eb78727812f3a652a3fd3464d"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q52ql89rcwgb1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8197f09a5a380aed1ef09aff2ff876071b3182fb"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q52ql89rcwgb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=146307f5533cd5cc2bc8cd6c802840e76ef2f36f"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/q52ql89rcwgb1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c38871536fff15c7b8df8431e84409310f631138"}, "id": "q52ql89rcwgb1"}}, "name": "t3_15ljihm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/FRzMVGtBP1cUwr_LLmlvxUxtlVWUdwD7dVTFywBi9es.jpg", "edited": 1691507183.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1691504275.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/q52ql89rcwgb1.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c38871536fff15c7b8df8431e84409310f631138\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/q52ql89rcwgb1.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c38871536fff15c7b8df8431e84409310f631138&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I posted a picture of the Dali Lama, comparing him to a picture of a corrupt prison guard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t bother to post that here, although you can find the picture buried in a comment somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t like that on instagram.

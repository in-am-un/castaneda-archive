And it's a good thing to analyze.  Scooping colors is not as simple as it seems at first. Once you \"see energy on the horizon\", you can go a lot of different directions, not specified by Zuleica. In fact, you could say, you reached the limit  of her teaching.\n\nBut, you still need to make that energy body solid, so don't get a fat head about going beyond her lessons!\n\nKeep wiggling those fingers.  You'll see something not even mentioned in the inspirational quote below.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nToday I was reading The Art Of Dreaming and this came up (just going to copy paste):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I discovered that the energy of our world wavers. It scintillates. Not only living beings but everything in our world glimmers with an inner light of its own. Don Juan explained that the energy of our world consists of layers of shimmering hues. The top layer is whitish; another, immediately adjacent to it, is chartreuse; and another one, more distant yet, is amber.\n\nI found all those hues, or rather I saw glimmers of them whenever items that I encountered in my dreamlike states changed shapes. However, a whitish glow was always the initial impact of seeing anything that generated energy.\n\n\"Are there only three different hues?\" I asked don Juan.\n\n\"There is an endless number of them,\" he replied, \"but for the purposes of a beginning order, you should be concerned with those three. Later on, you can get as sophisticated as you want and isolate dozens of hues, if you are able to do it.\n\n\"The whitish layer is the hue of the present position of mankind's assemblage point,\" don Juan continued. \"Let's say that it is a modern hue. Sorcerers believe that everything man does nowadays is tinted with that whitish glow. At another time, the position of mankind's assemblage point made the hue of the ruling energy in the world chartreuse; and at another time, more distant yet, it made it amber.  The color of sorcerers' energy is amber, which means that they are energetically associated with the men who existed in a distant past.\"\n\n\"Do you think, don Juan, that the present whitish hue will change someday?\"\n\n\"If man is capable of evolving. The grand task of sorcerers is to bring forth the idea that, in order to evolve, man must first free his awareness from its bindings to the social order. Once awareness is free, intent will redirect it into a new evolutionary path.\"\n\n\"Do you think sorcerers will succeed in that task?\"\n\n\"They have already succeeded. They themselves are the proof. To convince others of the value and import of evolving is another matter.\"\n\nThe other kind of energy I found present in our world but alien to it was the scouts' energy, the energy don Juan had called sizzling. I encountered scores of items in my dreams that, once I saw them, turned into blobs of energy that seemed to be frying, bubbling with some heat-like inner activity.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I wonder, is the white light I see (and apparently other people in this subreddit too) might have something to do with that?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBingo!  You have it!\n\nIt's \"seeing energy\".  Yes, on a horizon. But that's just to explain, why you don't focus the eyes to see it.\n\nThis is the inevitable result of scooping colors in darkness.\n\nYou spend so much time gazing at hues of color, that you become attuned to them.\n\nEventually you look past the purple haze (or through it as Juann has done), and you see that whitish light on the walls of your bedroom.\n\nOr on the bedspread.\n\nOr even on your hand.\n\nI suppose, but haven't been able to do this, that you bring that ability into lucid dreaming also.\n\nAnd in there, you can see if the dream world is \"real\", or a phantom world.\n\nCarlos nearly had a heart attack, or perhaps don Juan suggested he would and I've forgotten the story line, when he found his first dreaming world that actually had it's own energy.\n\nBut more interesting to the person asking this question might be, what else can you use this technique for?\n\nThe gazing at a horizon and seeing pure energy?\n\nThe easiest of course is to assemble another world. As cool as that sounds, it's the most basic use of this technique.\n\nI suppose your awareness gets sick and tired of not recognizing what that is, and forms something from it.\n\nAnother world.\n\nA newbie might worry, \"Not another imaginary technique, I've had enough of phony magic!\"\n\nYea, it comes from you.  You influence it.\n\nBut it has real energy!  You just saw it with your own eyes, on the walls.\n\nRegardless of how  you assembled it, it's real.\n\nAnd you can walk right in there, and emerge somewhere else.\n\nNot likely, but it can be done.  I have quite a few times.\n\nYou can also remain in there many hours, completely lucid the entire time.\n\nIt's different than dreaming asleep.\n\nEntering is obvious.  You walk or leap in.\n\nExiting is confusing.\n\nIn that case, the \"barrier\" is leaving, not entering.\n\nIn lucid dreaming, the \"forgetful barrier\" is entering.\n\nLeaving is clear.\n\nBut the most interesting thing about that whitish energy for me, right now is, can you use it to \"see trees\"?\n\nSomeone asked me to try to see a tree, which sounded like a good \"project\".\n\nMy theory is, that whitish energy can form an entire world.\n\nAnd it can be used to intercept dreams.\n\nIt's liquid reality.  Like that \"Terminator\" made out of mercury.\n\nIt can become anything.\n\nWhy can't that whitish glow form what a tree looks like, in it's energy ball state?\n\nYou just have to \"pick up\" that level of intent, and the assemblage point ought to adjust itself.\n\nWhich brings me to a warning of sorts.\n\nBliss in heightened awareness is wonderful!\n\nBut women are used to that kind of emotional high, and the lows when things are back to normal.\n\nBliss is not an effective motivation for women.\n\nI offer the idea of \"projects\".\n\nYou play with the colors until you reach heightened awareness, and then that's just the start, not the goal.\n\nOnce you get into a good mood, you get out your tiles and finish that mosaic you were working on.\n\nCholita has 2 going now.  Finished a bench a month or two ago.  Now it's wall hanging mosaics.\n\nOr you get out the knitting needles, and finish that peace offering gift for your manipulative grandma.\n\nI'm speaking figuratively.   Hopefully you come up with a better project than knitting.\n\nHeightened awareness is just where you go, to finish your latest project.\n\nCarlos called that, \"Navigating\".\n\nThe women can call it, \"Witchcraft\" if they prefer.\n\nIt is.\n\nSo once you get to heightened awareness, you really need to get some interesting hobbies, to put it to good use.\n\nIt's never boring.\n\nI suppose the ultimate is to try to enter the second attention more deeply, by just walking that direction. No technique. Walk ahead!\n\nThe real problem is, are you too tired?\n\nIf you had to climb a small mountain in order to get the peace and quiet to work on your latest \"project\", would you have the energy to do that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited twice\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title":

Like that &amp;quot;Terminator&amp;quot; made out of mercury.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can become anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t that whitish glow form what a tree looks like, in it&amp;#39;s energy ball state?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just have to &amp;quot;pick up&amp;quot; that level of intent, and the assemblage point ought to adjust itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to a warning of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bliss in heightened awareness is wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But women are used to that kind of emotional high, and the lows when things are back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bliss is not an effective motivation for women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I offer the idea of &amp;quot;projects&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You play with the colors until you reach heightened awareness, and then that&amp;#39;s just the start, not the goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you get into a good mood, you get out your tiles and finish that mosaic you were working on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita has 2 going now.  Finished a bench a month or two ago.  Now it&amp;#39;s wall hanging mosaics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you get out the knitting needles, and finish that peace offering gift for your manipulative grandma.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m speaking figuratively.   Hopefully you come up with a better project than knitting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heightened awareness is just where you go, to finish your latest project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos called that, &amp;quot;Navigating&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women can call it, &amp;quot;Witchcraft&amp;quot; if they prefer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So once you get to heightened awareness, you really need to get some interesting hobbies, to put it to good use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s never boring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose the ultimate is to try to enter the second attention more deeply, by just walking that direction. No technique. Walk ahead!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real problem is, are you too tired?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you had to climb a small mountain in order to get the peace and quiet to work on your latest &amp;quot;project&amp;quot;, would you have the energy to do that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "acff1442-e63e-11ea-b305-0e375464469b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "ie01zd", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 14, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ie01zd/shimmering_energy/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ie01zd/shimmering_energy/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1598027534.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g2iufpu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1598133296.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ie01zd", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "\\&gt; \" I found all those hues, or rather I saw glimmers of them whenever items that I encountered in my dreamlike states changed shapes. \"\n\nDid everyone notice that?\n\nTwo important things:\n\n\"dreamlike states\".\n\nMeaning, Art of Dreaming is not only about Lucid Dreaming.

No Reason not to Practice.](https://preview.redd.it/vxpi2kfwny051.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9103a225d1cb819066733b840fee45161e3fcfa)\n\nLet\u2019s just get this over with.\n\nThe very shadows you see there, turned into the 2 beings you see superimposed on the picture.\n\nI just drove back to that spot, to get a picture of the shadows.\n\nBut when I saw them transform as you see there, it was yesterday.\n\nThe creatures are just pics I picked up on the web.\n\nBut they\u2019re close enough.\n\nThere was a wind storm. I was waiting in the ATM drive through line. The ATM was busy, so I waited back from it. I didn\u2019t want to drive in there and be trapped, in case the guy using the terminal turned out to be a merchant with 20 things to do.\n\nThat left a space. It was shaded by a palm tree, and a tree of the type you could guess from those leaves on the ground.\n\nThe round leaf shadow was leaning over into the palm frond shadow.\n\nEarlier I\u2019d noticed, when I stopped at a traffic light and if I forced the levels of silence I use in darkness,  elements of what I see in front of me can recombine, producing shapes ideal for \u201cnot-doing\u201d.\n\nNot-doing is when you see something, can\u2019t figure out what it is, and don\u2019t bother. You let it be what it wants to be.\n\nThat lets you live in a world where magic surrounds you.\n\nLittle dreaming worlds can be found in anything you see around you.\n\nIt's that alternate view of the world don Juan wanted to give Carlos.\n\nThe sorcerer's view.\n\nOf course there are many other kinds of not-doing, but that\u2019s the classic one from Carlos\u2019 books.\n\nThe red rag stuck to a branch, which turned into a wounded animal.  Don Juan was so impressed, he kept the red rag.\n\nEver wondered how much it ended up looking like a wounded animal?\n\nI suspect that\u2019s up to Mr. DoubleTake.\n\nWhat he\u2019ll allow.\n\nBut it could look exactly like a wounded animal. There are no limits to not-doing.\n\nExcept, for what you'll allow yourself to see before you put an end to it.\n\nI\u2019ve pretty much enslaved Mr. DoubleTake, so I can watch and see what develops without that sudden shock to my consciousness, which makes it go away.\n\nSitting at that traffic light, on the way to the ATM, I let my eyes cross slightly.\n\nWith no thoughts, and Mr. DoubleTake asleep, I saw a door.\n\nA perfect door formed right in front of my car, around 60 feet away.  It was a combination of a piece of a lush green bush, the square cement flower bed that made a street divider, and some streaks of clouds in the clear sky.\n\nThey combined to make a shape, my brain didn't recognize it, and so my second attention said, \"How about a door?  Isn't it a door? Yes!!! It's a green door. I can clearly see that.\"\n\nLet me give you some advice on what *intent* is.\n\nIt's many things.  But the one  you can control the easiest is, \"I recognize that!\"\n\nActually, that's how everything has worked since you were a baby, and a \"chair became a chair\" for you.\n\nIn this case, my silence allowed my view of the world to change to an alternate reality.\n\nAs I thought about entering that door, the traffic light turned green.\n\nI headed for the bank to get some cash for Cholita.\n\nI used to have a couple of students who used fern gazing and did very well.\n\nSilence in a chair was too hard for them, so I suggested the gazing.\n\nBut they always seem to stop at some point. They convince themselves that in fact, the second attention can come out, using gazing.\n\nThey get a few thrills, realize maybe practicing has rewards after all,  and for a week or two they're putting in the time they ought to be.\n\nThey get fast dreams. Or weird geometric patterns.\n\nMr. DoubleTake, the part of our mind which hides impossible things from our sight, triggers and hampers their gazing.\n\nJust when it gets good, it ends.\n\nThey try to restore it, but in the long run they blank out and fall asleep.\n\nThey move to a chair, with eyes closed.\n\nI always wished one would go further. Specialize in gazing!\n\nBe a champion gazer.\n\nBut so far, no one has done that.\n\nI\u2019ve been using darkness, because of my need to \u201cprove\u201d Castaneda\u2019s techniques.\n\nGazing won\u2019t do that.  No one cares what weird things you see.\n\nBut they do care if you share dreaming with someone else, while awake.\n\nAnd if the laws of physics get spongy.\n\nGazing isn't impressive to anyone but the gazer.\n\nBut as it turns out, all paths lead to the same place.\n\nTo the Nagual.  And the Nagual isn't just a thing.\n\nIt's a being.\n\nSilence in darkness produces the three things you need most, for spectacular daytime gazing.\n\nYou need silence, an understanding of the \u201cshine\u201d of gazing, and you need Mr. DoubleTake to leave you alone.\n\nSilence so that the assemblage point can drift.\n\nThe gazing itself, looking with slightly crossed eyes at the entire scene,  provides the pull of the assemblage point, towards the direction of the second attention.\n\nLet me explain that in more detail.\n\nSilence will only ALLOW your assemblage point to move.\n\nIt DOES NOT move it.\n\nSomething has to attract your attention, to get it to move.\n\nIn darkness, you can look for puffs of color.  But if you don't see any, you'll just have to keep trying.\n\nWith gazing, you force it.\n\nYou flood the eyes, and with them not focusing on anything in particular, a piece of a shadow over there combines with a piece of a shadow over in the other place, with neither of them being related to each other.\n\nBut your eyes are used to focusing on 3D objects, and the views from each eye are not the same.\n\nThe eyes bend and flex, until the right pieces from the right eye, line up with the corresponding pieces from the left eye.\n\nAnd we \"feel\" the depth that way.\n\nBut we also focus our attention on the newly formed double view, which is reduced to one view.\n\nWith gazing, we produce anomalies.\n\nMistakes.\n\nThe leaf shadow has nothing to do with the fern shadow.\n\nSo our \"Tonal\" cannot make sense from it.\n\nIt panics.  Out comes the second attention to help out.\n\nUsing an analogy for what goes on, the first attention, the Tonal, is like a spoiled little brother who thinks he can do anything.\n\nHis older brother, the second attention, teaches him to fly drones.\n\nOnce he can barely make them work, he grabs the controls away and stubbornly refuses to share.\n\nIf his older brother tries to give him some advice, he shouts at him and says, \"You're always trying to confuse me!  Go away!\"\n\nHe's a spoiled brat, until he gets into trouble.\n\nWhen the drone is in danger, he calls to his older brother.\n\n\"Please help me!\"\n\nNow his brother, the second attention, is allowed to help.\n\nThat's what happens with the ferns.  And it's also why this is faster than looking for puffs of color in darkness.\n\nYou're \"forcing\" the issue.  Forcing the second attention to manifest.\n\nThat's all you need!  That and silence causes the assemblage point to move.\n\nBut you need to know about that \u201cshine\u201d to get just the right effect. The shine pulls on what you\u2019re gazing at, to extract something.\n\nThe \"shine\" makes what normally would require an hour or two of effort, take only seconds.\n\nThe shine is best learned in darkness.  It's faster to learn in darkness than in daylight.\n\nThis gives a sense of what the shine can do:\n\n[https://www.np.com/r/castaneda/comments/gcu4yk/how\\_to\\_burn\\_a\\_hole\\_in\\_reality/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/gcu4yk/how_to_burn_a_hole_in_reality/)\n\nAnd Mr. DoubleTake has to let it happen in either case.  Gazing, or using colors in darkness.\n\nYou have to get control of him no matter what.\n\nFortunately, by the time you learn the shine you've also got him under control.\n\nBut it's important to understand how he works until then.\n\nHe can get upset by what he sees, then give you a quick stomach twitch, or make you worry that you\u2019re about to go crazy.\n\nIt's like he literally shakes your head and rubs your eyes, to \"make it go away mommy, please!\"\n\nJust like he used to do with the monsters under the bed.\n\nYou can\u2019t fake what's needed to defeat that.\n\nBeating down Mr. DoubleTake.\n\nIt takes a lot of practice and special efforts to subdue him.\n\nOnce you can, this is what can happen. What you see in that picture.\n\nI didn\u2019t just see a funny pattern among the shadows at that ATM.\n\nIt turned into a full dream.\n\nA story of a woman in love with a dragon dog.\n\nThe dragon dog was formed by the curve of that palm frond. His back was defined by those stripes. If you look, you can see the roundness of those shadows. They form a dog body shape, like the one in the superimposed picture.\n\nThe woman came from the leaves of the tree.\n\nAt first, I saw her head and thought, \u201cThat\u2019s so cool, it looks like a woman\u2019s face.\u201d\n\nShe smiled at the dog creature.\n\nThen I got a shock. She pulled a bouquet of flowers into her arms, smelled them, and spun around in delight.\n\nAt that point her entire body was formed. She spun around elegantly and naturally.\n\nThere was no doubt that had become a dreaming image. My second attention had taken the rattling leaf shapes, and composed a dreaming being from them.\n\nFor a while, she was still made from shadows. But soon I could see her colors and there were no holes in her.\n\nI got knowledge of her history.  And that of the dragon dog.  For an instant, I knew the story.\n\nI gazed at the beast, consoling myself with the thought that he didn\u2019t really look like anything real.\n\nSuddenly I noticed I could see his red color. There was no way those shadows had a red tint.\n\nI strained to understand what he was, and I saw a perfect round representation of his heavy body.\n\nHe had tassels coming from his back. Around 6 of them, in the center of his red back, spaced equally apart, and sticking up around 8 inches with the ends of the  yarn that made them perfectly falling to the sides. Each was a different color.\n\nI couldn't find a picture like that on google images, but it was clearly a Chinese dragon dog costume.\n\nIt was as good as the brightest dreaming image, and in full color.\n\nDoesn't it really annoy you, when people say that dreams are in black and white?\n\nIt's absurd!\n\nDreams are what makes your daily world, idiot!\n\nYou think there's a difference???\n\n(Ranting at imaginary \"scientist\".)\n\nThe woman reached out her hand, touched the dragon dog, and pulled herself up to his face. She leaned in and seemed to kiss him.\n\nThe car in front of me was done with the ATM and pulled forward.  I watched to see if it had gone far enough that I could take it's place at the ATM machine.\n\nI looked down again to see only shadows in front of me.\n\nEdited four times\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Fern Gazing as Entry to Dreaming Worlds", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"vxpi2kfwny051": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vxpi2kfwny051.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d15ed342c31e7184a89430b551febc69ceed269b"}, {"y": 162, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vxpi2kfwny051.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7f996d0332981be89847d05c4b9efb26a074c4c"}, {"y": 240, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vxpi2kfwny051.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c6b536888c07c2ff01f48e90a0c24c1f44f6d27"}, {"y": 480, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vxpi2kfwny051.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b39742d57175725548ee159be1a3eef3639f9aaf"}, {"y": 720, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vxpi2kfwny051.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9559bce05c252a717d93cbe30065db842662ad3f"}], "s": {"y": 768, "x": 1024, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vxpi2kfwny051.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9103a225d1cb819066733b840fee45161e3fcfa"}, "id": "vxpi2kfwny051"}}, "name": "t3_gqhb1x", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/HOyAOx4QKBnFJ_O6h6OLj98UcQuIfOLLS6yWo9M7jrw.jpg", "edited": 1590530392.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1590434270.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vxpi2kfwny051.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f9103a225d1cb819066733b840fee45161e3fcfa\"&gt;Waiting in the Drive Through ATM Lane?

Gazing, or using colors in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to get control of him no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, by the time you learn the shine you&amp;#39;ve also got him under control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s important to understand how he works until then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He can get upset by what he sees, then give you a quick stomach twitch, or make you worry that you\u2019re about to go crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like he literally shakes your head and rubs your eyes, to &amp;quot;make it go away mommy, please!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like he used to do with the monsters under the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t fake what&amp;#39;s needed to defeat that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beating down Mr. DoubleTake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of practice and special efforts to subdue him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you can, this is what can happen. What you see in that picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t just see a funny pattern among the shadows at that ATM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turned into a full dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A story of a woman in love with a dragon dog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dragon dog was formed by the curve of that palm frond. His back was defined by those stripes. If you look, you can see the roundness of those shadows. They form a dog body shape, like the one in the superimposed picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The woman came from the leaves of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, I saw her head and thought, \u201cThat\u2019s so cool, it looks like a woman\u2019s face.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She smiled at the dog creature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I got a shock. She pulled a bouquet of flowers into her arms, smelled them, and spun around in delight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point her entire body was formed. She spun around elegantly and naturally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was no doubt that had become a dreaming image. My second attention had taken the rattling leaf shapes, and composed a dreaming being from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a while, she was still made from shadows. But soon I could see her colors and there were no holes in her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got knowledge of her history.  And that of the dragon dog.  For an instant, I knew the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed at the beast, consoling myself with the thought that he didn\u2019t really look like anything real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I noticed I could see his red color. There was no way those shadows had a red tint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I strained to understand what he was, and I saw a perfect round representation of his heavy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had tassels coming from his back. Around 6 of them, in the center of his red back, spaced equally apart, and sticking up around 8 inches with the ends of the  yarn that made them perfectly falling to the sides. Each was a different color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t find a picture like that on google images, but it was clearly a Chinese dragon dog costume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was as good as the brightest dreaming image, and in full color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t it really annoy you, when people say that dreams are in black and white?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s absurd!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dreams are what makes your daily world, idiot!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You think there&amp;#39;s a difference???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Ranting at imaginary &amp;quot;scientist&amp;quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The woman reached out her hand, touched the dragon dog, and pulled herself up to his face. She leaned in and seemed to kiss him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The car in front of me was done with the ATM and pulled forward.  I watched to see if it had gone far enough that I could take it&amp;#39;s place at the ATM machine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked down again to see only shadows in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited four times&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d442824c-6005-11ea-b1ec-0ebd57ae4429", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "gqhb1x", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 14, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gqhb1x/fern_gazing_as_entry_to_dreaming_worlds/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/gqhb1x/fern_gazing_as_entry_to_dreaming_worlds/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1590434270.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "frzn463", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_frxaijg", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "If you try to be silent all day long, eventually you start to see things like that everywhere.\n\nDon Juan introduced Carlos to playing with the wind early on, maybe for that reason.\n\nOr maybe it was his Ally.

I was thinking to myself (not in words), &amp;quot;yea, I guess sound might be useful to a beginner...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s really sad.

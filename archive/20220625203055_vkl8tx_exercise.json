To top it off, he gets the most well known sweet/dessert that the restaurant was well known for. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as he gets back to the Himalayas and meets his Guru, he notices that Guru was stuffing himself with oranges reminding him of the way he was eating at the restaurant just a day ago. And, then his Guru looks him right in the eye and asks &amp;quot;How were the sweets?&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This completely blew any sense of logic or rationality author had. He could not fathom how did his Guru know? He had gone hundreds of miles away all alone in a city filled with millions of people. He got so overwhelmed that he instinctively started crying with tears down his eyes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect that there are people who are somehow able to access that part of the Universe which stores everything that has ever happened.

The one who blackmailed me to come here, created darkroom, and who later became \"Fairy\" to make herself less scary.\n\nIt's not the mushrooms themselves!  \n\nThose were only an aid, because Carlos could not move his assemblage point himself.\n\nRemember, you need 3 elements to do those \"Man of Knowledge\" shows, for which they charged.\n\nThey were merchants selling magic.\n\nLike the moth dust that brings images of people.\n\nAll of those are a \"shortcut\" to silent knowledge. For people who can't get there themselves.\n\nNothing else!\n\nThe drug high was irrelevant. It was the Ally who caused it.\n\nPeople obsess over \"the smoking mixture\" because they haven't a clue what's going on in the books, and the visuals of drugs is a big attention seeking device they can report to others, while clueless about what was going on.\n\nThe Men of Knowledge never learned to *see*.\n\nSo they never reached silent knowledge.\n\nThey had to rely on the allies to bring them there.\n\nThe talking lizards, the moth dust, traveling on water.\n\nAll of those are silent knowledge.\n\nI get there nightly, for at least 20 minutes.\n\nReliably.\n\nBut at first, when Carlos asked don Juan to teach him how shamans use plants,  don Juan had no choice but to do it the way Carlos asked, or risk him moving on to find another goofy Shaman man for his PhD thesis.\n\nMeanwhile, besides tricking Carlos into sticking around while he was slapped on the back and taught in heightened awareness, the only value of those smoking mixture episodes was to give Carlos a taste of silent knowledge.\n\nActual magic you can't explain away as a simple hallucination.\n\nAnd how a ritual (intent) and an ally are used to get there.\n\nBut you CAN'T get that without all 3 elements.\n\nDon Juan listed them, but it's obvious to anyone who does darkroom until they reach silent knowledge (or get some previews) what they are.\n\nYou need the ritual, so that you have the link to the intent of that ceremony. To get the specified results.\n\nBut it can be as simple as expecting it, in the case of Little Smoke.  You had to prepare the silly smoking mixture.  Which was a ritual.\n\nBut after that, you could just \"expect\" the results. And there were several available with Little Smoke.\n\nThose rituals are all lost, so no one can repeat that.\n\nEven if they found a bag of the mushroom mixture made by don Juan himself.\n\nNo ritual, no path to that specific technique. Because, no link to the intent.\n\nThen you also need the ally. \n\nThe ally is the one who reaches out, and channels silent knowledge according to the intent you activated, using the ritual.\n\nWe have the Ally!  \n\nCarlos left her to us.\n\nFinally you need the power plants, to move the assemblage point.\n\nI'm not sure why you believe there's any benefit to the mushrooms themselves.\n\nIt's a total misunderstanding of what's going on.\n\nAnd completely proven that it's a misunderstanding, because in the 55 years since his books came out not a single person learned any sorcery.\n\nNot even a tiny bit.\n\nThey just got high, and pretended.\n\nIf it wasn't so, we wouldn't be chatting.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jn9sk89", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re very confused here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, no psychonaut has ever gotten anything out of this subreddit, nor have they learned any real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And most like to claim they are NOT psychonauts, when it&amp;#39;s clear they are.

It was the Ally who caused it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People obsess over &amp;quot;the smoking mixture&amp;quot; because they haven&amp;#39;t a clue what&amp;#39;s going on in the books, and the visuals of drugs is a big attention seeking device they can report to others, while clueless about what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Men of Knowledge never learned to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they never reached silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had to rely on the allies to bring them there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The talking lizards, the moth dust, traveling on water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of those are silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get there nightly, for at least 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reliably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at first, when Carlos asked don Juan to teach him how shamans use plants,  don Juan had no choice but to do it the way Carlos asked, or risk him moving on to find another goofy Shaman man for his PhD thesis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, besides tricking Carlos into sticking around while he was slapped on the back and taught in heightened awareness, the only value of those smoking mixture episodes was to give Carlos a taste of silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Actual magic you can&amp;#39;t explain away as a simple hallucination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And how a ritual (intent) and an ally are used to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you CAN&amp;#39;T get that without all 3 elements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan listed them, but it&amp;#39;s obvious to anyone who does darkroom until they reach silent knowledge (or get some previews) what they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need the ritual, so that you have the link to the intent of that ceremony. To get the specified results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it can be as simple as expecting it, in the case of Little Smoke.  You had to prepare the silly smoking mixture.  Which was a ritual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after that, you could just &amp;quot;expect&amp;quot; the results. And there were several available with Little Smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those rituals are all lost, so no one can repeat that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if they found a bag of the mushroom mixture made by don Juan himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No ritual, no path to that specific technique. Because, no link to the intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you also need the ally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ally is the one who reaches out, and channels silent knowledge according to the intent you activated, using the ritual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have the Ally!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos left her to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally you need the power plants, to move the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure why you believe there&amp;#39;s any benefit to the mushrooms themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a total misunderstanding of what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And completely proven that it&amp;#39;s a misunderstanding, because in the 55 years since his books came out not a single person learned any sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not even a tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just got high, and pretended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it wasn&amp;#39;t so, we wouldn&amp;#39;t be chatting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_142uync", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/142uync/blue_line_of_suffering_expierence/jn9sk89/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1686154356.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1686154356.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jn9dxoo", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "isthisasobot", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1686148834.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jn8zful", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_br6e04o0", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "About the magic mushrooms.. there's something more special to them than being just a \" substance\" .

female.\n\nThere are HUGE differences.\n\nBut you're stuck in being angry about them,  insisting those can't be allowed to exist.\n\nInstead of trying to understand how to exploit them.\n\nAnd so, you're trapped in one of those differences yourself, while denying them and threatening to break things so that people don't pay attention to them anymore.\n\nYou're doing the precise opposite of what you pretend to be doing.\n\nI've begun to conclude lately, that for effective teaching of women you MUST create some sexual intrigue.\n\nPerhaps it has to be out in the open, and \"resolved\" before you can get female apprentices to commit.  \n\nWomen are just more alert to that side of things.\n\nAnd if it's completely absent, they tend to lose interest or believe it's something \"undesirable\" about them.  So they'll go where they're desired.\n\nEven if they believe they aren't thinking that way.\n\nI get comments from some women, that Cholita makes them jealous.\n\nWhat???  She's a loathsome, murderous monster most of the time.  How can they be jealous of that?\n\nIt's because somehow they think there's some competition going on here.  \n\nIt's bizarre...\n\nSo that one of the techniques used in the lineages which we've read about, is to make new female apprentices feel threatened by sexual advances from the male members.\n\nTaisha thought don Juan was going to rape her, and then it turned out he was setting her up to be attacked by his ally, so she could learn to control it.\n\nSo that when lineage men engage in \"shenanigan's\", they're really just trying to \"resolve\" that obsession of women, so they'll join and be serious.\n\nThat's not to say that Julian and Carlos didn't enjoy it a bit too much.  But that's just a personality flaw of those Nagual leaders.\n\nWhich turns out to be just as effective as a teaching method, even if it's kind of ugly.\n\nIf you don't get women to either \"be intimate\" or \"firmly reject advances\", they aren't serious about learning. They'll be looking for something else to put their efforts into.\n\nSpeaking of which, Cholita likes to \"firmly reject advances\" more than she likes to \"be intimate\".  And Carlos noticed that instantly, so he never pushed her in that direction.  \n\nTo the disappointment of Cholita who was used to being approached by all men around her.\n\nSo whatever you think you know about male versus female, it just comes from a place of anger, and not from reality. Maybe from witchcraft subreddits?\n\nI get kicked out of those instantly.\n\nWhat the reality of male and female differences is, we don't yet know.\n\nBut Carlos had women shaving patterns in their pubic hair for him.\n\nAnd got them to cut their hair short, which according to Cholita produces an astonishing reduction in male advances as they're out walking in public.\n\nIt's a serious commitment.\n\nFor the men, not a big deal at all.\n\nIllustrating some major differences.\n\nI wonder if peacocks behave in the opposite way, since it's the male that has those amazing feathers he likes to put on display,  and the female peacocks are kind of scruffy looking?\n\nIt could be entirely biological.

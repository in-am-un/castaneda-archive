Sure you have!  Many.\n\nBut don't worry. What you see above is a \"bad day\" for me now.    I suppose as time goes on, we get greedy.\n\nBut always remember:  Greed buries magic.  It's like that rock, paper, scissors game.  Greed is the sheet of paper, rock the magic, scissors are your technical skills.\n\nWhen you find that the paper has covered the rock, and the room seems empty, get out the scissors and cut it up.\n\nJust force yourself to accept what you see.  And don't focus on the \"coolest\" thing in the room.\n\nThose cause your assemblage point to fine tune, to make the \"cool thing\" useful.\n\nIn other words, you shift horizontally.  Once you shift too far horizontally, you've gone off road.  Your tires will go into deeper and deeper mud, and you won't be finishing your journey along the J curve.\n\nThat can be fun.  But on a dull day, what you need most is to get to heightened awareness, as fast as possible.\n\nSo \"gaze at the overall darkness\", as the Phantom copy of Carlos once told me.\n\nDarkness you say?  How boring!!!\n\nNot really.  Every detail you see in the darkroom, is darkness creating details in intensity, so that you can see something.\n\nIt's like doing tensegrity.  The Tensegrity won't let you stop and stare at any one thing.  If you don't stop, and you keep watching and trying to remember the move,  you don't start fussing to yourself in your internal dialogue, and you might be able to use the Tensegrity to shift your assemblage point.\n\nOf course, that hasn't worked out well in the workshop crowd.  They needed darkness, because it's just too hard, with all that light.  Or possibly, \"subdued\" lighting might work.  Don Juan didn't call twilight, \"the crack between the worlds\" for no reason.  And with a little light, it's easier to keep your balance when doing long forms.\n\nBut I like absolute darkness, so I limit my moves to single ones.  Not long forms.\n\nWhile gazing at the darkness on a bad day, just accept it, and pretend you're a hunter scanning the entire mountain, looking for movement.\n\nBut you're too far away to catch anything, so you don't stop to watch the small rabbit you find.  You keep gazing, to get an idea of the overall type of prey available today.\n\nIf there's a beautiful woman (inorganic being) up there on the mountain, don't engage her.  Don't shout to her, don't stare at her.  You'll get sidetracked and never learn about the variety of prey on there.\n\nSome things you'll find have energy.  That's characterized by whitish light.  Remember the old adage:  \"Don't look into the light!!!\"\n\nIt's true here too, unless you want to assemble another world.  And doing that won't get you all the way to the end of the J curve.\n\nAlso be careful not to look deeply into dreams you find floating in the air. If something in the dream stands out, and you can, \"feel\" it, you'll get sucked right into that dream.\n\nAnd again, you will not move all the way on the J curve.\n\nThe hand movements shown can allow you to control it like a video game.  Give them a try!  But you can make your own, those are just examples.\n\nAnd one final curiosity you'll discover on your own.\n\nSee that marble up there in the corner?  It's aware.\n\nBut it's not alive.\n\nIt's impossible to explain.\n\nIt binds activity together, like glue.  \n\nIf you work very hard, it \"feels\" that.  \n\nAnd if it's a dull night, it might slip in a gift.\n\nSomething almost unnoticeable, until you think about it the next day.\n\nA gift of new learning.  Easy to overlook, when there's 1000 possible things you could do, in the darkroom.\n\nAnd so, a \"bad day\", is actually the best day to get a gift from *intent*.\n\nIntent is almost like a adult watching a baby play. If the baby is  having a hard time, but trying anyway, it's difficult for the adult to resist doing something to reward and please the baby.\n\nIntent does that.

I always think, they can look in the wiki.\n\nBut some don't like to.\n\nAnd if we had hundreds willing to practice, I'd say, tough luck. If you won't go look, that's your problem.\n\nBut actually it's our problem.  We need to teach people up to the level of don Juan, or this thing is going to be lost over time.\n\nDo you know the basics?\n\nMake yourself a dark space where you have at least 3 feet to turn around in, while standing. If you can't stand, you'll fall asleep. And also, you'll miss a bunch of tricks you can learn, based on contorting and moving around when needed.\n\nBut in fact, you can cheat and sit on the toilet, in the bathroom, if you can get it perfectly dark and your butt can stand to fall asleep. You'll just make it even harder for yourself that way.\n\nSo you begin by spending 1 hour forcing silence in the absolute darkness of it, before you start cursing that you can't find any colors. Wave your arm up and down. Look high up while bending back. Bend over to touch your feet, while forcing silence.\n\nAlways forcing silence, and with your eyes open like someone crazy glued them that way.\n\nSome nights, it just takes that long.  1  hour.\n\nAnd being a low light camera designer, I can tell you that the eyes continuously adjust to be more sensitive, for that full hour!\n\nIt's crazy, but they do.  Maybe the pupils widen so much, it's not evolutionarily safe to do that too soon. Might walk into the daylight from a cave, and run into a tiger. And have snow blindness.\n\nSo the full hour will increase the brightness.\n\nNow, if you are technically minded, let me give you more details.\n\nThe eyes have color balancing logic.  But they don't work in RGB the way computers do.\n\nIt's inefficient. So they work in 2 \"complementary\" colors.  Your eyes only have 3 choices. One set of 2 colors, a different set, and intensity.\n\nThe acceptance of the 2 colors makes that sensor more sensitive, than if it only accepted one.\n\nOld digital cameras used to do that.  Back in the \"video camcorder\" days where the thing was as big as a small car.\n\nOrange and purple are complementary.   I'm going from memory here, so pretend I'm right.  But it's probably more like cyan and magenta.\n\nWhen the amplification is cranked up way high, fake colors are created.  By the color balancing, trying to make it equal to \"grey\".   There's so little light, even 1 increment to correct the color, can result in a huge mistake which adds colors that aren't there.\n\nTry it with a dark picture!  Keep cranking up the gamma,  using free Thumbsplus, and you'll see weird colors in the dark places.\n\nSo the eye goes nuts trying to color balance the scene (to make up for bluish sunlight, or  yellowish tungsten light bulbs, or greenish fluorescent bulbs).\n\nIn fact, that's what causes the purple colors.  And it's why purple is so common.\n\nSorry to have tricked everyone. It's just eye junk after all...\n\nBut the \"old seers\" lived 10,000 years ago.\n\nNot only could they not read, but they probably believed the eyes beam out the light, and that's how you see.  You have magic laser eyes!\n\nNo way would they figure out the purple colors were \"color balancing side effects of the retina's neural net\".\n\nDare I say it?  The old seers were dumb as a rock.\n\nSo when they saw a purple blob, they thought that the light was beaming from the eyes, and striking the \"spirit of the purple realms\".\n\nOr whatever they came up with.\n\nOddly, their explanation is better than ours.\n\nBecause the brain **is** a neural net.  It never really perceives what's in front of us.\n\nCan't possibly! Imagine analyzing the 90 million pixels the eyes pick up, looking for patterns, matching that to a historical data base, all just to see one frame of a moving video.\n\nNo computer on earth can do that.\n\nIt just sort of \"guesses\", based on what you expect, and what it has.\n\nIt fills in most of what we perceive, using past history and just a few tiny cues from the actual eyes.\n\nAnd when something bizarre is all it sees, it adds a smiley face.\n\nOr a wall.\n\nOr a snake.\n\nOr it makes it pulsate, because it can't figure out what the hell that thing is.\n\nOr it spins in space, to show that  the system is broken, and you need go to get it repaired.\n\nGiven no input, it becomes desperate for any information at all.\n\nThis might be serious!!! There could be a bear in the back of that cave, about to eat you.\n\nAnd so if the old seer is in a dark cave worrying about bears, and part of the purple color balancing mistakes looks like a bear ear, you get a PERFECT replica of the last snarling bear he remembers.\n\nI mean, the face just materializes!   Not a piece of an ear.\n\nThe whole furry bear head, in all it's glory!\n\nOr you get \"Fairy\".\n\nIf Dan told you Fairy would visit.\n\nNow you have double the nonsense.\n\nEye junk, + lack of neural net information, + past worries = something real in front of you.\n\nThe darned thing looks real!\n\nBut actually it doesn't.  The truth is, NOTHING looks real.  We just got used to whatever we got used to, and call that, \"Real\".\n\nI hope I haven't discouraged anyone, because what happens next is the key.\n\nThere are in fact spirits out there.\n\nBut the sensory input they can give us, is very very tiny.\n\nDon Juan says they have \"almost no overlap\", but what that means to sorcerers is, they **do** have a little.\n\nSo the neural net, which is accepting the last run of old devalued Mexican pesos today, even though that money system is no longer worth anything, will be very happy to include some weak spirit input.\n\nAnd the spirit can take over the whatever it is, you imagined.\n\nLike Fairy!\n\nSuddenly, she's alive for real!\n\nThat's why the first hour is important.  If you can't do it, don't blame me.  Both Juan and I have to put up with that 1 hour, if we cheat and skip a day or two.\n\nIt's so bad, I just don't skip anymore. Plus,  if I tried to leave my dark room, to go do something, Cholita might murder me.  Last night was a close call.\n\nSo I'm trapped in the practice room the instant I get home, until sunrise when Cholita expects me to leave, or else.\n\nIf you make it to the 1 hour mark and a bear is about to eat you, I'll tell you why you need the other 2 hours.\n\n3 is ideal for darkroom practice.\n\n5, and you're a little weird the next day.\n\n8 and you have a grin all day long, and people wonder why you're such a bastard today.", "edited": 1614735326.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gphei0c", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juan thought it wasn&amp;#39;t enough of an explanation.

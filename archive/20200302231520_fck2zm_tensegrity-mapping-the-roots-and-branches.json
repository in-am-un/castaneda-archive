Use the teflon balls or the nails of the hands to rub or vibrate these areas.\n\nA few comments are added, however:\n\n\\#2: Rub up and down along the tendons.\n\n\\#3: Do not vibrate but simply exert slight    pressure.\n\n\\#4: Take the left wrists with the right hand    by putting the right thumb on the inside of the wrist, and the index and middle    fingers on the backside of the wrist as shown in the picture; flap the left    hand back and forth by tilting the left wrist using the right hand. On the leg, roll the teflon ball from the Achilles tendon across the front of    the foot to the back and return. Several times.\n\n\\#5: On the hand, simply press, do not vibrate. On the foot: Tap the edge of the left heel with the right pinky, tap behind    the heel with the ring-finger, and tap the area at the base of the ball of the    foot with the middle finger, rhythmically; 1-2-3...1-2-3...\n\n\\#7: This is more a stationary rubbing motion    than a vibration.\n\n\\#8: Just press, don't vibrate.\n\nEnd the mapping by rotating the left shoulder forwards, with the elbow bent palm facing the front. Then, take the left foot    with the right hand, and put the left hand below the left knee, and make scooping    forward motions, to disperse the energy that you have activated by vibrating    and rubbing the areas of mystery, throughout the body.\n\nThis pass is closely related to the Tree pass, also known as 'facing the oncoming time'.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrevious related posts:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/eusjy6/left\\_arm\\_areas\\_of\\_mystery\\_mapping\\_tensegrity/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/eusjy6/left_arm_areas_of_mystery_mapping_tensegrity/)   \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/euqup3/left\\_leg\\_areas\\_of\\_mystery\\_mapping\\_tensegrity/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/euqup3/left_leg_areas_of_mystery_mapping_tensegrity/)", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Tensegrity - Mapping the Roots and Branches", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 89, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"vg9yhv3w0ck41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 69, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vg9yhv3w0ck41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5f88c497cc8f060e9f13ffa9c03d1bf01410478"}, {"y": 138, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vg9yhv3w0ck41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9603e23f3d191bc3a065278b6e37c5f9061c18ba"}, {"y": 205, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vg9yhv3w0ck41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b853c4a726de49cfb4c3322f2578782f6c3dfff5"}], "s": {"y": 408, "x": 635, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vg9yhv3w0ck41.jpg?width=635&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6735c4774fcc58929601cbeff16c0529171c51fc"}, "id": "vg9yhv3w0ck41"}}, "name": "t3_fck2zm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/8Bbtfq102agCajJpm1LMHXSOCOcTuaQcegbrjyaOnlU.jpg", "edited": 1583187507.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1583187320.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAPPING THE ROOTS AND BRANCHES - (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20041222123351/http://home.tiscali.be/wim.degent/Notes/RootsBranches.html\"&gt;source page, without image&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one goes into more detail on the hands and soles of the feet, as well as the exact type of vibration/pressure one should be shooting for.

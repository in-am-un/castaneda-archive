It's don Juan's explanation of the process involved in Four Gates Dreaming. And nearly anyone out there interested in Castaneda's writings, has tried to do it at least a little.\n\nYou have to become lucid. That means, you have to realize it's a dream, and yet you are seeing things that look real anyway. To prove you are lucid you look at your hands, and then at objects.\n\nWhen you do that, an alert goes out to the inorganic being's tunnels. We have a live one! Send a scout!!!\n\nWhat they want, is for you to be able to perceive them so they can play. It's really not that complicated to understand. If you can't see them, they can't play with you.\n\nIf you can perceive them in any way, they can. And it's really boring in those inorganic being caves. They might get to live billions of years, but it's not as much fun as our 100 years.\n\nAs don Juan said, they are \"compelled\" to send a scout.\n\nThe same happens in darkroom gazing. You learn to see the energy on the inside of your own luminous shell. That's the energy that you \"redeploy\" with Tensegrity. It gets pushed to the outside by worry, but consciously manipulating it with your hands and legs causes it to flow where you are looking. It ends up back in the center, ready to \"prop you up\", for activity. It creates the \"energy body\".\n\nBut those puffs \"aren't really there\". If you haven't seen a brilliant purple puff of light, floating in a perfectly dark room, you're in for a treat. At first they are vague. But as your assemblage point moves, due to gazing at them, they can become as intense as the sun. Except, if you look into the sun, it hurts! The puffs never hurt the eyes, and yet they can be overwhelmingly bright.\n\nSo if you want an inorganic being, you can find them on the puffs of color in the darkness. Since it's \"not really there\", it's a dream image. And you are consciously focusing your attention on it. Which means, you can now perceive them.\n\nPeople encounter them in the dark room two ways I know of. They show up riding on a puff, like a face projected onto a pink cloud in the sky.\n\nSeeing \"skulls\" on clouds is common for people who can shift their assemblage point. Cholita is the queen of \"cloud skulls\". But we have dark room gazers who can perceive those also.\n\nSo IOBs like to make a splashy appearance in the dark room, if they can. If not, they stand next to you and you can't quite see them. They are always just barely \"out of my view\". My theory: That's \"double assist\" in seeing them. You can't, so he helps. But don't ask what that really means. I have no idea.\n\nBy playing with them daily, even if it's just a tiny amount, you eventually make them into your friend. Imagine waking up at night, turning your head to look up at the ceiling, and there's your little friend hoping you get up and play in the dark.\n\nBut guess what! It works the same way with recapitulation!\n\nIn fact, recapitulation is planned dreaming. Nothing more. Think about it!\n\nYou can't plan an endless dream upfront, based on imagination. That would be like trying to write 20 movie plots all at once, which go from one to the other. Like writing the entire Marvel Comic movie series in one session.\n\nIt's not possible.\n\nBut you CAN remember your summer trip to camp, back when you were in elementary school.\n\nAnd you can certainly remember Becky, the first girl you had a crush on. You can remember years and years of her, and your inability to get things to work between you.\n\nSo recap is \"planned dreaming\". If you object to that \"dreaming\" part, don't forget that eventually the scenes become visible, and you can even enter into them, and either play the lead character, watch from the side, or in cases where you have a connection to the person, you can recap someone else. You can literally go back in time, and recapitulate La Gorda learning from don Juan.\n\nSo recap is even more \"dreaming\", than dreaming itself. It's \"designer dreaming\"!\n\nAnd that means, you can get an IOB in there.\n\nThe IOBs have a problem. Once you start doing recap they can feel your attention focusing on past memories, and trying to visualize them. It's the same sort of energy as looking at dreaming objects, while going back and forth to your hands. You're going from memory to memory, trying hard to actually see it with your eyes.\n\nBut as a beginner, you won't succeed at that much. It won't be very visual.\n\nThe iobs feel the energy and come to visit, but they can't find a way for you to see them. There's no puffs of color in the darkness for them to ride on, and get your attention.\n\nThere's no rock with a small bush next to it, like you might find in a dream, for them to jump out from and scare you.\n\nThey seem to have nothing.\n\nExcept, remember the talking coyote?\n\nThat was almost surely Little Smoke, helping Carlos \"Stop the World\" for the first time. Inorganic beings like to help out with that. I had help myself.\n\nSo it wasn't a talking coyote. It was an inorganic being. Later Carlos and don Juan got into a discussion about whether it could really talk. Carlos heard it with his own ears, but in the end he wasn't sure.\n\nProbably the best we could say is, they can communicate telepathically.\n\nWhich is how they can reach you during recapitulation!\n\nThey \"fit themselves\" into your planned dreaming, as a false memory.\n\nIt's not even hard for them. You're straining to remember more details from a past event. That trip to the lake for example.\n\nAs you concentrate on the shore of the lake, and which little creatures you saw on the sand there, the IOBs have a chance to interject a false memory.\n\nRemember that perfect red crystal you found there? The tiny one the size of a matchstick? Didn't the lake manager tell you, there's tourmaline in those hills, and it washes down to the lake?\n\nAnd a perfect red tourmaline crystal like that, even very small, is extremely rare and valuable.\n\nBut what did you do with that crystal? You strain to remember, as you get sucked into a new dream, the one implanted by the inorganic being. It's already \"playing\" with you, which is what it wanted all along.\n\nYou clearly remember you took that crystal home, and put it in a box on a shelf. Wait! It's the shelf just above your head! You could reach up above your recapitulation crate, and get it right now!\n\nThat's an inorganic being. You just hooked one, during recapitulation. Or she hooked you.\n\nGiven a little more of that, and you'll find yourself staring into an inorganic being tunnel, right in front of your eyes. Once they tie into your recap, they do all they can to help you move your assemblage point further.\n\nHopefully into their world.

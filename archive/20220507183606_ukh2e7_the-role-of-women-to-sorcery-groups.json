Apparently reddit has \"offensive picture auto detect\".  I just wanted to explain, no one did that. It was the computer.\n\nThat's so cool!!!  All I did was add the picture, the little thing spun a bit longer than usual, but no more than 45 seconds. And up popped the \"People in underwear alert!\"\n\nVery cool.   Except, how prudish can you get?\n\nThis is like \"main street in Asia\" advertisements above the largest department stores.\n\nAnd often with the tongues of the women sticking out far as they smile provocatively.\n\nI guess in this modern day of cellphone cameras, with women deciding what's offensive, the \"porno tongue\" is no longer a thing.\n\nBut imagine landing in Taipei airport, and there's a lovely chinese lady high above your head doing the Hustler magazine tongue sticking out.  The caption reads, \"Welcome to Taiwan!\"\n\nThink it's innocent?\n\nNope. It's asia.\n\nYou can easily get that. It's not even shameful.\n\nThe Thai airline plays, \"The girls bring the boys out\", when any Eva Airline flight lands in Bangkok, coming from a chinese country.\n\n\"Thai\", if you say it twice, means \"wife\" in mandarin.\n\nAmericans are oddly dumb about the rest of the world. If you travel to foreign countries on business and follow local customs, a lot of the time you can't tell your friends back home about it.\n\nWomanizing is mandatory on business visits.  It's even mandatory after work, for new men in large corporations.  Communal blow jobs with your fellow staff after work, are not uncommon.\n\nOf course, we descended from the Pilgrims.  Never recovered from that.\n\nAnd THAT'S the \"ugly american syndrome\".\n\nIt's NOT some texas used car salesman ordering servants around on \"The Love Boat\", or a \"Columbo\" episode.\n\nIt's americans thinking everyone is the same, everywhere, and that noticing differences is racist.\n\nIt's well known by foreigners.  You get someone obsessed with making sure everyone is treated the same, and they come off as thinking anyone not white is inferior. So we have to hush up and suppress speech around us.\n\nI once was speaking with a grandfather from Singapore, because he was deathly afraid of the turbulence on the airplane we shared.    Wanted to visit the grandkids in California.\n\nI got into a conversation with him about interesting food customs among the population in Singapore, which is a diverse population. He seemed surprised I found it interesting.  It became quite lively, and extended to Russian \"manners\".\n\nSpeaking of which, don't give anyone a gift there. It's too complicated to understand and you could even get stabbed.\n\nAn obviously american white couple lingered nearby our airplane conversation, because we were in the row with no seats in front of us.  Their presence put an end to the conversation.\n\nChinese nationals had stood there, and no one worried they'd get weird if they heard the conversation.  But the americans triggered the \"ugly american alert\".\n\nAsia is very good at hiding it's dirty secrets from westerners.  If you ask them to explain themselves they say, \"It can't be helped.\"\n\nThat's true!  We only pretend to be nice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe don't exactly have a \"sorcery group\", but someday we might resemble one.\n\nWhen we can meet in the phantom copy of the subreddit, we could be considered a \"group\".\n\nOr when we can find each other in some other form of shared waking dreaming.\n\nBut there's a little confusion on how that might happen.  At least, among the men.\n\nSo let's just clear that up.\n\nMen are shit. Just an extension of femaleness.\n\nThe only reason they seem to be \"leaders\", is because they're bullies.\n\nLook at the horrible invaders we get here, when we gain a little energetic momentum.\n\nA group of 3 typically, descends on this subreddit and tries to bully everyone with their delusions.\n\nThey come to the only place on the internet with real magic, and try to take it down.\n\nLeaders?\n\nNope. Just crazy bullies.\n\nWe had another 3 this week!  One still lurking around out of pity on the part of Techno. He likes to believe people can be reformed.  Or is that two?\n\nWhich is Techno's job of course.  Keeping this place from being destroyed by men.\n\nAnd not a pleasant job.\n\nWomen on the other hand usually don't want anything to do with \"leading\".  At least, not the talented witch types.\n\nThey don't mind \"organizing\" and contributing, but \"leading\" is more of a male obsession.\n\nThere are exceptions of course, since Women have been convinced their place is to reproduce in the river of shit.\n\nThat produces \"side effect\" behavior.  Not given to the one form of slavery (finding your soulmate and making a baby), they try to adopt a different form of slavery. Or to become the slave controller, as the famous female guru Carlos met had done.  She was a \"super mom\" to her followers because her assemblage point was huge, and she could easily manipulate others.\n\nBut in general, women are witches.  And they *KNOW* that if they haven't been brainwashed by religion.\n\nSo they mostly just view male attempts to practice magic as amusing.\n\nOr if the men are succeeding, they find it interesting.\n\nBut they have nothing to prove to themselves.\n\nWhich makes them ideal students.  Sorcery CANNOT be learned.  It has to be lived, by your own efforts.\n\nWhen I post techniques, it's just hoping to make you greedy so you put in the work.\n\nThe men might try to follow \"steps\" to \"learn\" it.  Like a bad player still lurking around in here, currently likely resorting to self-pity attempts, to save face after he was outed.\n\nThe men obsess over my posts, while the women only see \"what you can do\" and then use their own path.\n\nBut if men are just dumb talentless bullies, how come they end up leading?\n\nLet's look at that from the collected books and lecture notes, so that you come to  understand the truth of things.  Carlos was seemingly collecting women not because he was a pervert as the critics claim, but because it was his only chance.\n\nAny hanky panky he had going on (there was plenty), was more about how women commit.  And how to keep them from seeking their \"soul mate\".  It's something I wouldn't like to engage in myself, but it's a better strategy than trying to reason with women to fully join an effort to learn magic.  You're still not the most important thing they have going on, until they give up that pursuit of a romantic partner.\n\nJadey recently told us of the troubles Carlos had at the end, realizing his time was up and \"no one believes me\".\n\nIf everyone thought he was a fraud, there was nearly no chance anyone would use his amazing books to find their own path to freedom.\n\nJadey said the women's private class focused intensely on doing the Tensegrity forms they had, \"perfectly\".\n\nAgain, something you won't understand until you can *see* what tensegrity really is.\n\nHe was quite strict about it!  He even said they were \"his last chance\".\n\nWhen he saw that wasn't working, because no one's assemblage point was moving far enough, he tried not-doings.\n\nNot-doings are the direct path to the double.  It's like \"hidden puffery\".\n\nWhen you gaze at something hoping to see weird stuff, you're really just looking for mini puffs of your energy body.  Those are the only way the Tonal gets to perceive the second attention for the first time.\n\nWell, other things can cause it.  Such as tiredness, stress, fright. Or the naguals blow.  Or drugs.\n\nBut if you're going to stare at a rock as a not-doing, in reality you are looking for pieces of the double, to give you \"double assist\" to your eyesight.\n\nWhen you read the following notes from books and lectures keep in mind, our path is not the same. We don't have a Nagual leader.   Those can confuse the matter, and make men seem more powerful.  But even in that situation the actual leader of the group (don Juan in this case),   knows the truth.\n\nThe good news about all this is perhaps that the men who are capable of learning on their own, which is only 1 in 500 who \"join\" this subreddit, don't mind at all if women are more powerful.\n\nWomen are as amusing to men as inorganic beings are.  And men tend to believe they're in charge, even when they are actually the pawns of women or IOBs.\n\nFrom lecture notes:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIn response to the question of why the nagual is the leader, Florinda claims: \"Carol Tiggs, as the nagual woman, could very easily be the leader of our group. However, it is a sorcerer's belief that women are universes in themselves. As universes they have no interest whatsoever in leading other universes! Sorcerers also believe that maleness is an extension of femaleness.\n\nTherefore, it is antithetical to the spirit of womanhood to lead. The nagual is not quite a leader; **he is the person who lends the sorceresses sound mindedness, sobriety, and purpose**. He can do this because of the heavy conditioning he suffered under the hands of the previous nagual.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFrom the books:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"The Nagual told me that the four winds are women. That is why female warriors seek them. Winds and women are alike. That is also the reason why women are better than men. I would say that women learn faster if they cling to their specific wind.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nA woman, of course, is much more supple than a man. A woman changes very easily with the power of a sorcerer; especially with the power of a sorcerer like the Nagual. A male apprentice, according to the Nagual, is extremely difficult.\n\n\"For example, you yourself haven't changed as much as la Gorda, and she started her apprenticeship way after you did. A woman is softer and more gentle, and above all a woman is like a gourd. She receives. But somehow a man commands more power. The Nagual never agreed with that, though. He believed that women are unequaled; tops.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWomen are better than men in that sense. They don't have to jump into an abyss. Women have their own ways. They have their own abyss. Women menstruate. The Nagual told me that that was the door for them. During their period they become something else...\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDuring that time a woman, if she wants to, can let go of the images of the world,\" la Gorda went on. \"That's the crack between the worlds, and as the Nagual said, it is right in front of all of us women.\n\n\"The reason the Nagual believes women are better sorcerers than men is because they always have the crack in front of them, while a man has to make it.\"\n\n\"Well, it was during my periods that I learned in dreaming to fly with the lines of the world. I learned to make sparks with my body to entice the lines and then I learned to grab them...\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"How long does it take you to get to see that reddish glow?\" I asked.\n\n\"A few seconds. The moment my attention is on my womb I'm already into dreaming\" she continued. \"I never toil; not ever. Women are like that. The most difficult part for a woman is to learn how to begin. It took me a couple of years to stop my internal dialogue by concentrating my attention on my womb. Perhaps that's why a woman always needs someone else to prod her.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI asked don Juan to explain my experience with la Catalina. And both of them again howled with laughter.\n\n\"Women are definitely more bizarre than men,\" don Juan finally said. \"The fact that they have an extra opening between their legs makes them fall prey to strange influences. Strange, powerful forces possess them through that opening. That's the only way I can understand their quirks.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHe told me that the nagual Elias's house had an open, roofed section in the front, where he had a forge and a carpentry bench and tools. The tiled-roof adobe house consisted of a huge room with a dirt floor where he lived with five women seers, who were actually his wives. There were also four men, sorcerer-seers of his party who lived in small houses around the nagual's house. They were all Indians from different parts of the country who had migrated to northern Mexico.\n\n\"The nagual Elias had great respect for sexual energy,\" don Juan said. \"He believed it has been given to us so we can use it in dreaming. He believed dreaming had fallen into disuse because it can upset the precarious mental balance of susceptible people.\n\n\\*\\*\\*", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Role of Women to Sorcery Groups", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 92, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"67slxgj403y81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "o": [{"y": 859, "x": 1295, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/67slxgj403y81.png?width=1080&amp;blur=40&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a76e2902ad40095bc6d179e96cdd84c5e1e9d7d5"}], "p": [{"y": 71, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/67slxgj403y81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8340c2d8c0ee515237b3624ca0aed439e665786b"}, {"y": 143, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/67slxgj403y81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed199e6017322f29206513f96026449dc5c2f3b2"}, {"y": 212, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/67slxgj403y81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a11c2ce3a9de4180dd143a0f70497eb40583ae24"}, {"y": 424, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/67slxgj403y81.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9701ead32f57a8eb796a8779aa9df3ed01b0209"}, {"y": 636, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/67slxgj403y81.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e106671a07512e97c1eadda4911a20c1aebbc5ff"}, {"y": 716, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/67slxgj403y81.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4d78318dbfd87c2b7747bc66dc4d6e009b83c99"}], "s": {"y": 859, "x": 1295, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/67slxgj403y81.png?width=1295&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d41a605a73c9abf16d35846297ec2c5dbd9cd943"}, "id": "67slxgj403y81"}}, "name": "t3_ukh2e7", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "nsfw", "edited": 1652031404.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1651941366.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/67slxgj403y81.png?width=1295&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d41a605a73c9abf16d35846297ec2c5dbd9cd943\"&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why, but the women seem like more fun...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A note on the NSFW.

It&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;hidden puffery&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you gaze at something hoping to see weird stuff, you&amp;#39;re really just looking for mini puffs of your energy body.  Those are the only way the Tonal gets to perceive the second attention for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, other things can cause it.  Such as tiredness, stress, fright. Or the naguals blow.  Or drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#39;re going to stare at a rock as a not-doing, in reality you are looking for pieces of the double, to give you &amp;quot;double assist&amp;quot; to your eyesight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you read the following notes from books and lectures keep in mind, our path is not the same. We don&amp;#39;t have a Nagual leader.   Those can confuse the matter, and make men seem more powerful.  But even in that situation the actual leader of the group (don Juan in this case),   knows the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good news about all this is perhaps that the men who are capable of learning on their own, which is only 1 in 500 who &amp;quot;join&amp;quot; this subreddit, don&amp;#39;t mind at all if women are more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women are as amusing to men as inorganic beings are.  And men tend to believe they&amp;#39;re in charge, even when they are actually the pawns of women or IOBs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From lecture notes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In response to the question of why the nagual is the leader, Florinda claims: &amp;quot;Carol Tiggs, as the nagual woman, could very easily be the leader of our group. However, it is a sorcerer&amp;#39;s belief that women are universes in themselves. As universes they have no interest whatsoever in leading other universes! Sorcerers also believe that maleness is an extension of femaleness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is antithetical to the spirit of womanhood to lead. The nagual is not quite a leader; &lt;strong&gt;he is the person who lends the sorceresses sound mindedness, sobriety, and purpose&lt;/strong&gt;. He can do this because of the heavy conditioning he suffered under the hands of the previous nagual.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the books:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Nagual told me that the four winds are women. That is why female warriors seek them. Winds and women are alike. That is also the reason why women are better than men. I would say that women learn faster if they cling to their specific wind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A woman, of course, is much more supple than a man. A woman changes very easily with the power of a sorcerer; especially with the power of a sorcerer like the Nagual. A male apprentice, according to the Nagual, is extremely difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For example, you yourself haven&amp;#39;t changed as much as la Gorda, and she started her apprenticeship way after you did. A woman is softer and more gentle, and above all a woman is like a gourd. She receives. But somehow a man commands more power. The Nagual never agreed with that, though. He believed that women are unequaled; tops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women are better than men in that sense. They don&amp;#39;t have to jump into an abyss. Women have their own ways. They have their own abyss. Women menstruate. The Nagual told me that that was the door for them. During their period they become something else...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During that time a woman, if she wants to, can let go of the images of the world,&amp;quot; la Gorda went on. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s the crack between the worlds, and as the Nagual said, it is right in front of all of us women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The reason the Nagual believes women are better sorcerers than men is because they always have the crack in front of them, while a man has to make it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, it was during my periods that I learned in dreaming to fly with the lines of the world. I learned to make sparks with my body to entice the lines and then I learned to grab them...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How long does it take you to get to see that reddish glow?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A few seconds. The moment my attention is on my womb I&amp;#39;m already into dreaming&amp;quot; she continued. &amp;quot;I never toil; not ever. Women are like that. The most difficult part for a woman is to learn how to begin. It took me a couple of years to stop my internal dialogue by concentrating my attention on my womb. Perhaps that&amp;#39;s why a woman always needs someone else to prod her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked don Juan to explain my experience with la Catalina. And both of them again howled with laughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Women are definitely more bizarre than men,&amp;quot; don Juan finally said. &amp;quot;The fact that they have an extra opening between their legs makes them fall prey to strange influences. Strange, powerful forces possess them through that opening. That&amp;#39;s the only way I can understand their quirks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me that the nagual Elias&amp;#39;s house had an open, roofed section in the front, where he had a forge and a carpentry bench and tools. The tiled-roof adobe house consisted of a huge room with a dirt floor where he lived with five women seers, who were actually his wives. There were also four men, sorcerer-seers of his party who lived in small houses around the nagual&amp;#39;s house. They were all Indians from different parts of the country who had migrated to northern Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The nagual Elias had great respect for sexual energy,&amp;quot; don Juan said. &amp;quot;He believed it has been given to us so we can use it in dreaming. He believed dreaming had fallen into disuse because it can upset the precarious mental balance of susceptible people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": true, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "ukh2e7", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 34, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ukh2e7/the_role_of_women_to_sorcery_groups/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ukh2e7/the_role_of_women_to_sorcery_groups/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1651941366.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i7swciu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1652021316.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i7silqu", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It's the vagina of course.\n\nOr is that technically the hole?\n\nI never get that stuff right.

Not even me except once every 6 months or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also used Olmec figurines (&amp;quot;The wrestler) to open a 1000 mile tunnel from California, to far south in the americas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I check that one out nightly to see if anything I sent has returned.  I sent Fancy last night.  She&amp;#39;s my untamed Ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to see what Siberia had these days, 13,000 years after they left to come here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no one&amp;#39;s going to fight to protect that stuff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s been taken over by Russian Castaneda fans, trying to find a &amp;quot;niche&amp;quot; shamanism franchise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s murder just to try to protect what Carlos was teaching!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pity about Siberian Shamanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {},

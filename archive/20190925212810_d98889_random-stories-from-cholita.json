A bunch of new electrical towers along the freeway, carrying dozens of lines instead of the traditional few.\n\nThat was the proof. She turned to me and said, \u201cAnd I *KNOW* who you are!  Do you think I\u2019m that na\u00efve?!\u201d\n\nWhile looking at the clock to determine her schizophrenic \u201ccycle time\u201d, measured by distance between excessive giggling and angry shouting (5-15 minutes), I talked to her about the possibility of teaching her to change worlds.  Maybe that would help her.\n\nShe said, \u201cTHAT\u2019S WHERE I ALREADY AM!! DON\u2019T YOU KNOW THAT???   IT\u2019S THE SAME AS YOU.  I\u2019M LIVING IN A DREAM.\u201d\n\nFortunately for me, she\u2019d decided not to flee that day. She might remain around me a few more days.\n\nShe let me know that I owed her for it.  She was, \u201cA woman of great substance.\u201d\n\nI got a lecture on that later, while sipping cocktails with her.   Cholita\u2019s face was just 8 inches from mine the whole time. She looked really angry, but her lips were somewhat pouty at the same time.   And she was sporting her very short hair, died perfectly black, and still in the same style Carlos insisted on 21 years ago.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but stare into her eyes while she chastised me for neglecting a woman of great substance.   She'd crossed her legs on the bar stool such that they emphasized her curvy hips.\n\nShe knew I was staring.  I\u2019m autistic. We don\u2019t look people in the eyes unless social conditions require a quick glance. We see things others don\u2019t see when we look at faces.\n\nBut under special circumstances, staring at someone\u2019s eyes can be quite pleasant.\n\nWhile staring at her I said, out loud, \"Thank you Carlos.\"\n\nShe giggled.  We've discussed that before, and Cholita agrees. Carlos pushed us together.\n\nI suspect that being a woman of great substance means something if you\u2019re from the upper class in Mexico City, with a father who builds bridges for the government.\n\nStill I couldn\u2019t understand it myself.  It just seemed like unnecessary conflict. I tried to explain that to her, but she said I was an idiot and didn\u2019t understand anything.\n\nYes, I said I took her shopping. I don\u2019t know if impeccable warriors go shopping.  But former Sunday class members do.\n\nAnd women are women. Especially witches.\n\nI\u2019m all for shopping, because afterwards is dining and drinking. Cholita is so crazy that it\u2019s only nice to be with her when she\u2019s drunk.\n\nOk, that\u2019s an excuse. Getting women drunk is a favorite pastime of some Stormtroopers. It\u2019s also fun to go shopping, if they open the dressing room door occasionally.\n\nAnd with smart phones video recorders in hand, twice the fun.\n\nNo, she said I couldn't post any pictures.\n\nBut I had to ask.\n\nI suspect that \u201cWarriors\u201d just hide their excesses better than Stormtroopers.  And Cholita can prove that with her memories of private classes.\n\nOn the way to her favorite mall, located in Los Angeles very near to all the Sunday Class action,  I asked Cholita to tell me more stories.\n\nAgain, women are women. They love to tell you about their life.\n\nBut the fun thing is, if you have a westerly dreamer in front of you, who was tinkered on by Carlos, every story is useful. And each story can actually move your assemblage point, if you\u2019re silent.\n\nCarlos told us, sorcerers are story tellers. I believe there\u2019s a lot more to that than it seems.\n\nI had to catch myself and stop that movement of my assemblage point on occasion during her stories, just to make sure we didn\u2019t drive off the freeway into a ditch.   It was the same sensation as when Cholita's luminous shell lit up for me the first time.  A tingling from the feet to the head, and the sensation of floating away.\n\nIt would scare the hell out of a non-sorcerer. But you can get used to it, and it's rather pleasant.\n\nShe corrected my understanding of many things with her stories. It seems, I have a very \u201cmale\u201d view of sorcery. Cholita doesn\u2019t.\n\nNot only did she tell me the story of how a Catholic school nun accused her of stealing candy in elementary school, and how she came out on top in the end, but she also told me everything she could remember about Sunday Classes.\n\nUnfortunately, my memory is not very good when it comes to Cholita\u2019s stories. There\u2019s just too many to remember.\n\nOne of the most remarkable things about Cholita is that she loves to talk, and has an amazing memory for social events.\n\nIf Carlos was going to plan to give me an assistant, to help put the group back together again, he couldn't have made a better choice than Cholita.\n\nHe bound us together, and now if I don't take her to live with me, she'll die.\n\nIf she lives through this, she'll make a very good scout for all of us.\n\nI'm starting to realize that a \"scout\", a term Carlos often used, must be someone who looks in other directions and tells you what's there.  While you're going down one path, she wants to go down another.\n\nInsists actually.  If I'm in Los Angeles with Cholita, I'm guaranteed to end up in the most remote places, looking closely at random things.  Even in places we aren't supposed to go.\n\nAfter she recounted the 100th person who attended private classes, and we both couldn\u2019t believe we\u2019d forgotten so many, I begged her to let me record her voice. So that I could write down what she remembers.\n\nShe said yes!\n\nAs it turns out, women are women. They like to surprise you with \u201cyes\u201d, even when it seems slightly offensive.\n\nIt\u2019s what they love to do. They dole out energy to men, often as slowly as possible. It keeps the association going.  It\u2019s a lot like the behavior of inorganic beings, which are said to be mostly female.\n\nOr the behavior of the Nagual Julian, when controlling his allies.\n\nI believe that our messed up social order and oppressive internal dialogues are a result of that interaction between women and men.\n\nIt could be the fliers. But I don\u2019t think so.  Just look to your parents to understand.\n\nOne question I asked her was, \u201cWho did you kiss from Sunday Classes?\u201d\n\nHer first answer was, \u201cOOHHHHH,  NOOO ONE!!!!\u201d\n\nHer voice became very high and stilted, as if she were speaking through a tube.\n\nShe sounded like I imagine Zuleica\u2019s parrot voice must have.\n\nThe thought occurred to me that the human voice changes when a person is half asleep. And it\u2019s difficult to talk when fully asleep.\n\nI know, I\u2019ve done it.   It came out like Genaro's sleeping voice.\n\nMaybe Zuleica was fully asleep, while she instructed Carlos on dreaming, using her parrot like voice.\n\nCholita thought about her previous answer a little more and said, \u201cKiss???   Well\u2026 Let me think\u2026\u201d\n\nOut came a list of the most handsome men floating around Carlos while he was still here. Including what were their best features.   A whole list of new men she hadn't mentioned before.\n\nIt seemed to be a list of who she'd liked to have kissed, but only one of them seemed like a possible candidate.\n\nHe's fat now.  Cholita kept tabs.  She doesn't like fat men.\n\nSomewhere along the line there was also discussion of competition between private class women, for the available men. Women who were powerful in the inner circle, even competed with each other for Carlos\u2019 attention.\n\nWomen who had no conflict with anyone else, and were loved by all, became enemies in private classes.\n\nThe men she remembered included regular workshop attendees, audio equipment set-up men, Sunday class members, and people from all over the world who only came to a workshop a few times.\n\nSome managed to help with the workshop management details, but still never got invited to private classes.\n\nCholita didn\u2019t know why.\n\nI was surprised how many were from Argentina.\n\nI asked her why and she said, \u201cBecause. Just look at them!  They\u2019re super white. It\u2019s all about power, and the white people get special considerations.  The Argentinians are really Italian you know.\u201d\n\nOddly, I remembered most of the people she mentioned.\n\nAnd I also remembered Carlos\u2019 fondness for Argentinians. It was something about their incredible height (Carlos was very short), and their manner of dress. Maybe their boots came up a time or two.\n\nMiles and Aeron seem to be teaching in Argentina now. I was never clear on whether they were originally from there. It\u2019s hard to keep Cholita on topic.\n\nBut maybe that\u2019s why there were so many Argentinians.\n\nCholita isn\u2019t politically correct. She doesn\u2019t have to be.  She isn\u2019t what you would call, \u201cwhite\u201d.  So she gets a free pass.\n\nShe\u2019s half pure South American Indian. Her father was from a very handsome race with rounded heads, slightly larger noses, and very full lips. She told me the tribe, and that her father could still speak that dialect.\n\nUnfortunately, I have poor knowledge of indigenous Mexican populations and can\u2019t remember the name she told me.\n\nAngry politics in this country has made it impossible to ask about such things. In fact, it\u2019s probably offensive even to say \u201ctribe\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s part of the internal dialogue imposed on us, to create phony conflicts which keep the mind imprisoned.\n\nWe balance it out with cute kitten videos, to recharge for the next angry rant.\n\nThe other half of Cholita is Spanish. Think 1960s Spanish movie stars with long wavy hair, and pouty red lips. Usually they look a little angry and defiant, but they\u2019re after what all women want.\n\nLike Cholita.\n\nShe showed me pictures of famous Spanish language movie stars, and said that her mother looked exactly like that.\n\nI was very interested in what Cholita had to tell me about her life before Carlos, because I couldn\u2019t figure out how she got into private classes.  As it turned out later, it was Carlos at his best, engaging in the *ruthlessness* and *cunning* aspects of stalking.\n\nI asked her if maybe that didn't happen with most of the Sunday class members.\n\nEventually she came to the conclusion, that we should try to figure out how ALL of the people in Carlos\u2019 private classes got there.\n\nI told her, if we don\u2019t, no one else will be able to do it.\n\nAnd maybe there\u2019s something significant in how it all went down.\n\nAt the end of the dinner, when Cholita picked up her \"extra\" drink, I warned her.\n\nWhatever you tell me will be read about 1000 years from now.  People will still find Carlos' books, and then what I posted here about it.\n\nShe sipped noisily on her \"refreshing drink\", custom designed by a handsome bar tender who was fully warned about Cholita, and bribed generously.\n\nShe didn't stop until there was only ice left in the bottom, seeming to ponder what she might want to leave out of her stories.\n\nContinued later.\n\nEdited: twice to add details about \"scouts\".

As it turned out later, it was Carlos at his best, engaging in the &lt;em&gt;ruthlessness&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cunning&lt;/em&gt; aspects of stalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked her if maybe that didn&amp;#39;t happen with most of the Sunday class members.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually she came to the conclusion, that we should try to figure out how ALL of the people in Carlos\u2019 private classes got there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her, if we don\u2019t, no one else will be able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And maybe there\u2019s something significant in how it all went down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the dinner, when Cholita picked up her &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; drink, I warned her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you tell me will be read about 1000 years from now.  People will still find Carlos&amp;#39; books, and then what I posted here about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She sipped noisily on her &amp;quot;refreshing drink&amp;quot;, custom designed by a handsome bar tender who was fully warned about Cholita, and bribed generously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t stop until there was only ice left in the bottom, seeming to ponder what she might want to leave out of her stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continued later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: twice to add details about &amp;quot;scouts&amp;quot;.

And she describes it as a bloody event that will take everyone down.\n\nI've removed the knives from my home in anticipation.\n\nLast night I picked Cholita up promptly after work. She was decked out in solid black. A tight fitting outfit with rumples and details all over it. Black boots to top it off.

It\u2019s famous for October Fest, being very popular with exotic dancers who like to drink beer and dance on tables.\n\nSomewhere in the midst of that little town was a place called, \u201cThe Living Temple\u201d.\n\nWe entered the parking lot to find a man who seemed to be signaling us to leave.\n\nI stopped and asked him if the temple was located here.\n\nHe said, \u201cOh, the spiritual event?\u201d Yes, just park anywhere.\n\nI commented to Cholita that I wasn\u2019t inclined to spirituality.\n\nCholita marched right in to the village without knowing where the event was located, and said, \u201cOHHHHHH. HOW ADORABLE!!!!\u201d\n\nAlthough we had only 5 minutes left to get to the event, she began to examine every single detail of the German village, even talking to random people as if they were best friends who finally found each other again.\n\nI was anxious to get her to the event on time. Carlos typically locked the doors when private classes started, and if you weren\u2019t inside, you were out of luck.\n\nWe found the place 3 minutes late. There was a shop owner hawking essential oils, and a nervous looking man with something about ayahuasca printed on his t-shirt.\n\nThere were only 3 attendees. With Cholita and me, he now had 5.\n\nI asked him about the ayahuasca, and whether you could try it in the states. Cholita\u2019s mentioned wanting to try it on more than one occasion.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t know. I asked him if he\u2019d like a giant jar of shrooms which I grew for a double woman. No one I know is interested in them.\n\nHe seemed embarrassed and said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d\n\nHis lecture consisted of an assortment of weird topics. He admitted he\u2019d put together the presentation only 30 minutes ago.\n\nIt was a series of youtube videos.\n\nThere was an impressive study of abductees, showing that the experience was positive for more than 80% of them.\n\nEven when Lizard people abducted them. The implication seemed to be that the media, and people in general, were trying to cover it up by spreading fear.\n\nThere was an interesting presentation detailing evidence that the pyramids in Egypt were actually 36,000 years old, but had been re-carved at a much later date.\n\nAnd there was an analysis of NHIs.\n\nNHIs are inorganic beings. The \u201cscientific\u201d community has come up with that term as a general category. It means, \"Non Human Intelligences\"\n\nI\u2019m autistic. Get me around more than 2 people at a time, and I go out of control.\n\nSo I tried to explain all the NHIs and abductions as being the result of inorganic beings and sleep paralysis.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t familiar with the topic.  I tried to start at the beginning, but the frazzled looking other attendees obviously thought I was making up stuff.\n\nCholita told me to stop it, I was embarrassing her.\n\nAt one point in the lecture, Cholita started to laugh loudly. I\u2019d been worried about that. She isn\u2019t good for more than 15 minutes of coherence these days.\n\nThe lecturer asked her what was so funny. But she couldn\u2019t speak amidst all the laughing. I had to pipe in.\n\nShe\u2019s a witch I said. They do that.\n\nEveryone seemed satisfied with that explanation, or maybe they were too freaked out to comment on it.\n\nAt one point in the lecture, I felt incredible energy in the air. My assemblage point started to shift, and I felt again as if I would float away.  The familiar tingling I get around Cholita started at my toes this time, and trickled all the way to my head.  I began to see emanations in the air.\n\nIt didn't seem to be Cholita's energy.  I moved my hand to find some strands in the air. They were very solid. I wanted to see if I could trace where the energy was coming from.\n\nCholita,  looking straight ahead, seemingly in such a position that it would be impossible for her to see my subtle hand movement, pushed her hand over to block me.  I had to give up.\n\nThe Lecturer returned to explaining what he does for a living, and handing out pamphlets for other events he had, which cost money.\n\nHe nervously paced back and forth, seeming to be doing a little Tai Chi. His beautiful but frumpy dressed wife was sitting right near him. I got the impression she was there to prop him up, and promote him.\n\nSome of the other attendees interacted with the group, making comments about their own \u201cjourneys\u201d.\n\nThey all seemed to be a little damaged, but extremely polite and friendly.\n\nThe man\u2019s wife explained, their goal was to spread love, and not fear. Too often she said, there\u2019s nothing but fear and anger associated with new age things.\n\nAt the end of the lecture, she tried to hug us. I had to tell her, I don\u2019t hug.\n\nI suspect she was hoping to give us big hugs, so we\u2019d come to her husband\u2019s next event, where money was needed.\n\nCholita had lured me to that new age lecture event,  with the promise of wine drinking afterwards.\n\nBut she found a Syrian restaurant in that German village, which had no liquor license. The owner made a sign of praying that he could get one, when I asked.\n\nWe sat on a couch eating inappropriate food, listening to odd music that sounded like someone was in pain, while I tried to enjoy Turkish coffee.  Women wearing headdresses were staring at Cholita,  in her tight black outfit, probably thinking what a whore she must be,  going around with an older man.\n\nCholita decided she liked that place, and promised the owner to return.\n\nEdited: three times", "edited": 1569610948.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f1n1285", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermission part 2:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess new people reading this might be a little unhappy at all the chaos.

Typically she\u2019s good for a topic only once.  Twice if I insist, and on the 3rd try she becomes angry.  \n\nI believe she\u2019s scooping up energy as she remembers, and once she\u2019s used that up it\u2019s hard for her to repeat it.  As she scoops up the energy she begins to giggle, and then laugh so loudly that she has to cover her mouth and lie on her side.\n\nBut when asked to repeat that the next day, to clear up some point, she\u2019s solemn and wants to change the topic.\n\nIt\u2019s possibly similar to what happens when you push the envelope, getting silent enough to make something wonderful happen, and then find the next day that you can\u2019t do that again.\n\nNone of us has enough energy yet to repeat on demand. We need to find new positions of the assemblage point each time, to get that extra boost.\n\nI had planned to finish the stories today. But Cholita, who I\u2019m now thinking might more appropriately be called, \u201cthe dark scout\u201d, had other plans.\n\nShe insisted I pick her up after work, and kept me out so late that I was limited to 4 hours of sleep. \n\nToday I\u2019ll just relate that event, because with so little sleep my memory of those stories may be defective.\n\nBut first, what is a \u201cscout\u201d? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to figure out.\n\nIn his final days, Carlos seemed to be anxious to find \u201cthe orange scout\u201d. According to Cholita, he never did. But some of the women around him were hoping to be selected. I can\u2019t recall that story well, but Cholita\u2019s account seemed to include women standing in front of him for examination, as if he might have missed her all along. \n\nIt was about the time rumors went around private classes that he was going to gather 200 women, to do tensegrity together.\n\nI believe he only managed 50 before he gave up on that plan, or became too ill for the extra work load. He didn\u2019t attend that event, where he\u2019d put together 50. \n\nHe sent me and 2 other men, perhaps Felix and Corey. It\u2019s been a long time so it\u2019s hard to remember details.\n\nFelix, Corey, and I formed some kind of group he occasionally made use of.  And also, we seemed to pair up spontaneously.\n\nCholita remembered one such event. Carlos presented us with rusty steel balls, telling us to polish them by hand. \n\nHe rolled the ones he had in his hand for us, and commented how wonderful it would be, to have 2 such balls made from solid gold. The weight was what he was interested in.\n\nThat comment resulted in the private class members deciding to take up a collection, to actually make the balls for him.\n\nCorey and Felix seemed to have taken the lead in that endeavor. After they managed to gather only half the money for the balls, they came to me and asked what to do. \n\nI told them, why not just let me donate the rest? \n\nCorey nodded his head yes, and commented in a quiet voice, that would work.\n\nOut of fairness, I have to say that Cholita hates that accounting of the story.  She was giggling happily while she reminded me of the gold balls, but when I explained how they gathered the money, she cycled to her angry mode.\n\nShe accused me of making up stuff. In her mind, it was a joint effort. She shouted,  why did I always have to put myself in the middle of things?\n\nBeats me.  I just got stuck with the job. It\u2019s sort of how I got into private classes in the first place.\n\nBut I\u2019m meandering due to lack of sleep. What\u2019s a scout?\n\nEmilito was said to be a scout. From Carlos\u2019 books:\n\n\u201cDon Juan said that Emilito was merely reporting about things he had witnessed in his journeys through eternity. The role of a courier was to travel ahead of the Nagual, like a scout in a military operation. Emilito went to the limits of the second attention, and whatever he witnessed he passed on to the others.\u201d\n\nWe also have the blue scout from his books:\n\n\u201cThe little girl seemed to understand my despair and actually communicated with me, directly into my thoughts. She told me, essentially, what don Juan had already said: that she was a scout caught in the webs of that world. Then she added that she had adopted the shape of a little girl because that shape was familiar to me and to her and that she needed my help as much as I needed hers.\u201d\n\nCarlos often used ideas from his books to give names to people in his inner circle. I got the impression he was trying to tie them to intent, and also motivate them by creating a persona they had to adhere to when interacting with workshop and private class attendees. \n\nIt was stalking.\n\nWe had a blue scout in private classes. It was the famous Patty Parton, who was found dead in the desert. It was never determined if she took her own life out of despair, or was just wandering off in the Panamint Dunes of Death Valley, looking for a way back to Carlos.\n\nFor those of you not familiar with Death Valley, all I know about it is that I was warned repeatedly by anthropologists from Carlos\u2019 UC system, to never go there alone.  \n\nI was only 12, so they didn\u2019t give me more details.\n\nI vote for the latter explanation of Patty\u2019s death. She just went too far.\n\nIn my mind, a scout is a trouble maker gone out of control, but in such a manner that you can\u2019t ignore it, and end up actually being grateful for what they find.\n\nYou want to rest a bit, amidst all the activities required by sorcery. But they bring even more to handle. \n\nAnd you can\u2019t reign them in for whatever reason, so you just let them run wild. And that helps you perfect your own silence.\n\nCholita fits that description perfectly.\n\nNot only does she plunge into anything that comes to her mind, now submerged halfway in dreaming, but she has an astounding memory for social events which took place in private classes and workshops.\n\nCarlos couldn\u2019t have given me a better person to protect, and to try to engage in shared dreaming, so that all of us could find out if that part of his books is also true.\n\nIt\u2019s still up in the air whether Cholita will take her own life, or come to live with me. Or maybe find an old boyfriend to take her in, so she can escape captivity.\n\nLast night she hit me on the arm, and held up her middle finger a few times.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t done that before. \n\nMaybe she\u2019s warming up to me.\n\nBut as tired as she\u2019s made me, she\u2019s the best assistant I could find at this point.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for me to be able to enter waking dreams, but until two or more people can do it together, we\u2019ll be missing proof for half the stories in Carlos\u2019 books.\n\nContinued next due to word limits.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f1n0z8g", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermission part 1:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had planned to finish relating the stories of private class events, which Cholita recited to me rapidly while driving down the 405 this week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve only managed to remember 9 of them, out of the 100 or more private class and workshop attendees she talked about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve got an audio recorder on order, so that next time I can keep it all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although, I\u2019ll have to find a way to get Cholita interested in thinking about it that deeply again. Typically she\u2019s good for a topic only once.  Twice if I insist, and on the 3rd try she becomes angry.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe she\u2019s scooping up energy as she remembers, and once she\u2019s used that up it\u2019s hard for her to repeat it.  As she scoops up the energy she begins to giggle, and then laugh so loudly that she has to cover her mouth and lie on her side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when asked to repeat that the next day, to clear up some point, she\u2019s solemn and wants to change the topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s possibly similar to what happens when you push the envelope, getting silent enough to make something wonderful happen, and then find the next day that you can\u2019t do that again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of us has enough energy yet to repeat on demand. We need to find new positions of the assemblage point each time, to get that extra boost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had planned to finish the stories today. But Cholita, who I\u2019m now thinking might more appropriately be called, \u201cthe dark scout\u201d, had other plans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She insisted I pick her up after work, and kept me out so late that I was limited to 4 hours of sleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I\u2019ll just relate that event, because with so little sleep my memory of those stories may be defective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But first, what is a \u201cscout\u201d? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In his final days, Carlos seemed to be anxious to find \u201cthe orange scout\u201d. According to Cholita, he never did. But some of the women around him were hoping to be selected. I can\u2019t recall that story well, but Cholita\u2019s account seemed to include women standing in front of him for examination, as if he might have missed her all along. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was about the time rumors went around private classes that he was going to gather 200 women, to do tensegrity together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe he only managed 50 before he gave up on that plan, or became too ill for the extra work load.

Kylie was said to have been recruited from a Ken Eagle Feather workshop.\n\nMyself, I was recruited because I became a little thorn in Carlos\u2019 side with my Nagualist Newsletter. Kylie made a deal for me to stop it, and then I got invited to private classes. Another of the Chacmools even reminded me of it, after more than a year in private classes. She wanted to emphasize it to me.\n\nThat's why I didn't simply resume it, after Carlos' death. We had an agreement.  Following *intent* requires me to honor it.\n\nI\u2019d love to find out how everyone else got recruited, but I suspect we\u2019re years from being able to do that, if ever.\n\nCholita started her story by recalling someone she\u2019d missed in her last account. Her name was Pamela, she was from New York, but had lived in Barcelona before. She was amazingly beautiful, and everyone loved her. Cholita said she had \u201cgood vibes\u201d.\n\nBut she never made it into the private classes. She attended workshops, and Cholita took her into her apartment (or rented home, I\u2019m not clear on that).\n\nCholita likes her privacy, so after a week or two she kicked her back out.\n\nPamela did in fact volunteer to cut her own hair, even without pressure from Carlos.\n\nCholita had to be blackmailed.\n\nAfter cutting her hair, Pamela traveled to Caiaphas to swim in the sacred pools of water they have all over that place.\n\nShe mailed back a picture of her swimming naked in the sacred pool, and in the picture there were Fairy lights. Or orbs, as others call them.\n\nCholita explained, Jovannah was close to them also, and very much interested in \u201corbs\u201d.\n\nThat phenomena came up at that lecture Cholita dragged me to at Old World Village. One participant at that lecture was heavily into orbs, and said they were \"proof\".\n\nOf what, I don't know.\n\nBeing a stormtrooper, I asked Cholita the most important thing about that picture.\n\n\"You mean she was *really* **naked** in the picture???!!\"\n\nYes, Cholita said.\n\nI fancied that there might have been some hope on Pamela's part, that the picture made it's way back to Carlos. Sort of as a message.\n\nBut then again, as a stormtrooper I hoped that at least one man got to see the image. It didn't seem much use, passed around only between women.\n\nSomehow the topic changed to Margarita, someone very close to the inner circle. I wasn\u2019t sure of the relationship to this story, except that Margarita did travel to Mexico, in the process of securing Cholita for private classes. And Cholita lived with her for a while. Eventually Cholita got Margaritas dwelling, when Margarita upgraded to a house.\n\nI believe I was invited to visit Margarita\u2019s new home, and it was located on a hillside. I was impressed with the outdoor fireplace and little paths you could climb, to get up the hill. It looked like a perfect refuge for sorcery practice in the middle of a crowded city.\n\nI could be wrong on those details. That did happen, but with my autistic face blindness I\u2019m lucky to know who I\u2019m around, from one month to the next. I\u2019ll rely on Cholita for that.\n\nCholita started to ask me questions. It seemed that she was testing to see if I\u2019d gone mad, or could really do the things I\u2019ve learned to do.\n\nI took that as a chance to get her interested in becoming my partner, to try to salvage as many people from the workshop period as possible.\n\nWhile explaining *intending* and *will* to her, I brought up the movie that someone here had mentioned.\n\nCholita instantly knew the movie. It was \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d.\n\nI told her that humans sense their magic side, and long for it. So they create movies like that, where a man falls in love with someone he can't possibly have, but finds his way to her using *intent* alone.\n\nCholita said that the movie had a great impact on her.\n\nI asked her if she knew that time was malleable, and it was possible to go back and view the doings of past sorcerers.\n\nShe didn\u2019t get it, so I showed her by pointing to the amazing clouds overhead, and asking her if she didn\u2019t feel while looking into infinity, that we can summon things with our *intent*?\n\nThe air became heavy with energy, and I got that tingle up my body as before. Cholita began to laugh again.\n\nI was now surrounded by lines of dark and light, flowing out from her and into the air, as if they were reaching to the clouds.\n\nI explained to her that I was able to travel far into the second attention, the way Emilito had done. And that I wanted to teach her to do it, so we could verify that part of Carlos\u2019 books.\n\nShared dreaming.\n\nCholita became angry. She asked me, \u201cWhy would I want to get trapped in some sulfur smelling world you made on your filthy bedroom walls?\u201d\n\nShe said she likes it here.\n\nThe odd thing was, just 30 minutes before that she was explaining how she lives in hell and is trying to escape.\n\nI tried to explain how wonderful it felt to be in heightened awareness, but Cholita had lost interest in the conversation.\n\nSo I told her that it seems, Cleargreen did indeed split into 2 parts, as I had expected from observing Carlos interact with them in private classes.\n\nCholita agreed. She had expected the same thing.\n\nI had to tell her, I\u2019m sorry to report that neither side seems to be able to stop the world and assemble other worlds. They're still in the realm of doubt and pretending.\n\nBut that together, we could put pressure on everyone to work harder, and make some real progress.\n\nTo that end, I had set up a little paradise in my backyard, where Cholita and I could test La Gorda\u2019s flying technique around the fountain.\n\nShe looked at me, wondering if I had in fact gone nuts as she presumed. But she didn\u2019t seem certain of it.\n\nI told her that once she could do that, we could learn to summon entities for seances. Entities participants could really see.\n\nThen she could cash in too, like Cleargreen and Miles have done. I explained that I\u2019m not allowed to get any money from trying to save Carlos\u2019 techniques, but that rule didn\u2019t apply to her.\n\nShe had every right to teach, and especially so if she had pieces of the puzzle to show, which were beyond explaining.\n\nThat\u2019s what the community needed, some magical proof.\n\nA *dreaming* teacher. That's what everyone really wants.  And one as crazy and powerful as Josefina to boot.\n\nCholita lifted up her head and said, \u201cOhhh, I\u2019m a gonna cash in!!! You can be **sure** of that.\u201d\n\nTrue to her word for the first time, Cholita gave me a day of rest. She didn\u2019t insist I drive her all over, following the meal. And she gave me until 4PM the next day, to be away from her.\n\nI immediately resumed gazing in darkness and found, I hadn\u2019t lost anything from hanging out with Cholita. Instead, everything was different, and far more stable.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find my fairy, but Zoltar had become a bit more interesting, manifesting flat faces that don\u2019t change, and flurries of light which land anywhere I\u2019ve been making energetic movements in the air. His flurries of light were bright and soothing, not like Carlos' allies.\n\nI sat up on some pillows and tried to stop the world. I saw a yellow circle with a darker ring in the middle, spinning around very very slowly. I became so silent that I blanked out.\n\nI came back to consciousness staring at the perfect dreaming scene. It was as bright and colorful as the real world, and nothing changed when I looked at it.\n\nI wondered if my eyes were open or close, and found they had been closed. But when I opened them, I could still see the scene.\n\nI don\u2019t know when the transition occurred, but I found myself in the garden, with Cholita. There was a group of people gathered around the fountain.\n\nI recognized them as being from one of the worlds I can assemble. They **love** water.\n\nCholita put her fist on top of my hand and smiled.\n\nUsually she jumps a mile away and starts flailing her hands, if we accidentally touch.\n\nEdited", "edited": 1569709357.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f1qvgig", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholita seems to have been recruited from that place I wrote about a while back, up in the desert mountains of Mexico where wild peyote can be found.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That makes 2.

One participant at that lecture was heavily into orbs, and said they were &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of what, I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being a stormtrooper, I asked Cholita the most important thing about that picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You mean she was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;naked&lt;/strong&gt; in the picture???!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Cholita said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fancied that there might have been some hope on Pamela&amp;#39;s part, that the picture made it&amp;#39;s way back to Carlos. Sort of as a message.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then again, as a stormtrooper I hoped that at least one man got to see the image. It didn&amp;#39;t seem much use, passed around only between women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somehow the topic changed to Margarita, someone very close to the inner circle. I wasn\u2019t sure of the relationship to this story, except that Margarita did travel to Mexico, in the process of securing Cholita for private classes. And Cholita lived with her for a while. Eventually Cholita got Margaritas dwelling, when Margarita upgraded to a house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe I was invited to visit Margarita\u2019s new home, and it was located on a hillside. I was impressed with the outdoor fireplace and little paths you could climb, to get up the hill. It looked like a perfect refuge for sorcery practice in the middle of a crowded city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong on those details. That did happen, but with my autistic face blindness I\u2019m lucky to know who I\u2019m around, from one month to the next. I\u2019ll rely on Cholita for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita started to ask me questions. It seemed that she was testing to see if I\u2019d gone mad, or could really do the things I\u2019ve learned to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took that as a chance to get her interested in becoming my partner, to try to salvage as many people from the workshop period as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While explaining &lt;em&gt;intending&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; to her, I brought up the movie that someone here had mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita instantly knew the movie. It was \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her that humans sense their magic side, and long for it. So they create movies like that, where a man falls in love with someone he can&amp;#39;t possibly have, but finds his way to her using &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita said that the movie had a great impact on her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked her if she knew that time was malleable, and it was possible to go back and view the doings of past sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn\u2019t get it, so I showed her by pointing to the amazing clouds overhead, and asking her if she didn\u2019t feel while looking into infinity, that we can summon things with our &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The air became heavy with energy, and I got that tingle up my body as before. Cholita began to laugh again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was now surrounded by lines of dark and light, flowing out from her and into the air, as if they were reaching to the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I explained to her that I was able to travel far into the second attention, the way Emilito had done. And that I wanted to teach her to do it, so we could verify that part of Carlos\u2019 books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shared dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita became angry. She asked me, \u201cWhy would I want to get trapped in some sulfur smelling world you made on your filthy bedroom walls?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said she likes it here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The odd thing was, just 30 minutes before that she was explaining how she lives in hell and is trying to escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to explain how wonderful it felt to be in heightened awareness, but Cholita had lost interest in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I told her that it seems, Cleargreen did indeed split into 2 parts, as I had expected from observing Carlos interact with them in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita agreed. She had expected the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to tell her, I\u2019m sorry to report that neither side seems to be able to stop the world and assemble other worlds. They&amp;#39;re still in the realm of doubt and pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that together, we could put pressure on everyone to work harder, and make some real progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To that end, I had set up a little paradise in my backyard, where Cholita and I could test La Gorda\u2019s flying technique around the fountain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked at me, wondering if I had in fact gone nuts as she presumed. But she didn\u2019t seem certain of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her that once she could do that, we could learn to summon entities for seances. Entities participants could really see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she could cash in too, like Cleargreen and Miles have done. I explained that I\u2019m not allowed to get any money from trying to save Carlos\u2019 techniques, but that rule didn\u2019t apply to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had every right to teach, and especially so if she had pieces of the puzzle to show, which were beyond explaining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s what the community needed, some magical proof.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; teacher. That&amp;#39;s what everyone really wants.  And one as crazy and powerful as Josefina to boot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita lifted up her head and said, \u201cOhhh, I\u2019m a gonna cash in!!! You can be &lt;strong&gt;sure&lt;/strong&gt; of that.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;True to her word for the first time, Cholita gave me a day of rest. She didn\u2019t insist I drive her all over, following the meal. And she gave me until 4PM the next day, to be away from her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I immediately resumed gazing in darkness and found, I hadn\u2019t lost anything from hanging out with Cholita. Instead, everything was different, and far more stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t find my fairy, but Zoltar had become a bit more interesting, manifesting flat faces that don\u2019t change, and flurries of light which land anywhere I\u2019ve been making energetic movements in the air. His flurries of light were bright and soothing, not like Carlos&amp;#39; allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat up on some pillows and tried to stop the world. I saw a yellow circle with a darker ring in the middle, spinning around very very slowly. I became so silent that I blanked out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came back to consciousness staring at the perfect dreaming scene. It was as bright and colorful as the real world, and nothing changed when I looked at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wondered if my eyes were open or close, and found they had been closed. But when I opened them, I could still see the scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know when the transition occurred, but I found myself in the garden, with Cholita. There was a group of people gathered around the fountain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recognized them as being from one of the worlds I can assemble. They &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita put her fist on top of my hand and smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually she jumps a mile away and starts flailing her hands, if we accidentally touch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_d98889", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/d98889/random_stories_from_cholita/f1qvgig/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1569707173.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f1qvaxy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1569707103.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_d98889", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Still Intermission.

the perspective of what *intent* provides.\n\nI\u2019ve learned the value of that. What if all of life was based on what *intent* provides next?\n\nThat way it's not a personal thing.  Don Juan's party exhibited that behavior, and I can see now that it's natural.\n\nWhat we're trying to do is impossible. So we need to let go, and just accept what we get, and not hold on to things that don't work out.\n\nFor example, a witch told me to just use a spell on Cholita, the way Cholita kept leaving spells in my yard, to try to get me to do what she wants.\n\nThat assumes I have a preference for the outcome.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot less stress if I have none.\n\nCholita texted me last night, saying she made it to the airport. But she didn't text me when she got on the plane.\n\n3/4ths of the way through the flight, I got this: \n\nYuppie. Hi Daniel Patrick has been fun for you guys and you are  having a good day at the beach \ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f !!!\nThank the hotel lordship is a good morning \ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\ude0a. Hi \ud83d\udc4b is the time of \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude2d.\nThank the people who are officially working there \ud83d\udc26. Is any chance of a good looking \ud83c\udf4c\ud83d\udca6?\nForward for the day and ~#\u00a3&lt;$&amp;W\u201d \ud83d\udd0c\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udef5 too.\n\ud83d\ude4fWill let you know.\n\nUnfortunately, Spanish is Cholita\u2019s primary language, so she doesn\u2019t know the difference between \u201cat the plane\u201d, and \u201con the plane\u201d.\n\nAnd by the way:  \"Any chance of a good looking banana oozing drops of liquid?\"\n\nIsn't that what it says in her message???\n\nUhhhh....  Probably no chance of that tonight.  And who's Patrick?\n\nAbout 15 minutes from the airport, she finally told me she had gotten on board.\n\nBut traffic in the LAX loop was really slow, and I didn\u2019t meet her at luggage. She wandered off 2 terminals, and couldn\u2019t manage to text me coherently to explain where she was.\n\nI got her into the car, just barely.  Her head was shaking noticeably, and she was talking in a malicious baby talk.\n\nBut she began to report what she saw in Seattle, in great detail.  It was like she'd gone there just to come back and tell me.\n\nCholita's always been like that. Even 20 years ago, if you were with her driving in a car, she just continuously reported details of what she'd been doing lately.\n\nAfter the report on how wonderful Seattle was, she said she was very hungry.  She wanted a fancy meal, and \"wouldn't settle for something cheap\".\n\nBut it was too late. Everything was closed.\n\nSo she suggested, let\u2019s just go to that very expensive hotel there, and get dinner.   Hotel restaurants stay open very late.\n\nYea right...\n\nWe passed a Taco Bell and Cholita shouted to make a U turn, quickly!!!\n\nShe settled for a green burrito, commenting on how it was \"very filling\".\n\nAfter the burrito, Cholita started to call me a looser who can't get a woman.\n\nI was tempted to get out my cellphone, and show her pictures of absolutely drop dead gorgeous 22 year olds I'd been hanging out with lately.\n\nBut instead I reminded her, I'm celibate.\n\nThat's your problem, she said. She offered to become my pimp, and get me a girlfriend.  She said she'd \"set me up\", for one after the other and I could take my pick.

What if all of life was based on what &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; provides next?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That way it&amp;#39;s not a personal thing.

So we need to let go, and just accept what we get, and not hold on to things that don&amp;#39;t work out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, a witch told me to just use a spell on Cholita, the way Cholita kept leaving spells in my yard, to try to get me to do what she wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That assumes I have a preference for the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a lot less stress if I have none.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita texted me last night, saying she made it to the airport. But she didn&amp;#39;t text me when she got on the plane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3/4ths of the way through the flight, I got this: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yuppie. Hi Daniel Patrick has been fun for you guys and you are  having a good day at the beach \ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f !!!\nThank the hotel lordship is a good morning \ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\ude0a. Hi \ud83d\udc4b is the time of \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude2d.\nThank the people who are officially working there \ud83d\udc26. Is any chance of a good looking \ud83c\udf4c\ud83d\udca6?\nForward for the day and ~#\u00a3&amp;lt;$&amp;amp;W\u201d \ud83d\udd0c\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udef5 too.\n\ud83d\ude4fWill let you know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Spanish is Cholita\u2019s primary language, so she doesn\u2019t know the difference between \u201cat the plane\u201d, and \u201con the plane\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And by the way:  &amp;quot;Any chance of a good looking banana oozing drops of liquid?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t that what it says in her message???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uhhhh....  Probably no chance of that tonight.  And who&amp;#39;s Patrick?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 15 minutes from the airport, she finally told me she had gotten on board.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But traffic in the LAX loop was really slow, and I didn\u2019t meet her at luggage. She wandered off 2 terminals, and couldn\u2019t manage to text me coherently to explain where she was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got her into the car, just barely.  Her head was shaking noticeably, and she was talking in a malicious baby talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she began to report what she saw in Seattle, in great detail.  It was like she&amp;#39;d gone there just to come back and tell me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s always been like that. Even 20 years ago, if you were with her driving in a car, she just continuously reported details of what she&amp;#39;d been doing lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the report on how wonderful Seattle was, she said she was very hungry.  She wanted a fancy meal, and &amp;quot;wouldn&amp;#39;t settle for something cheap&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was too late. Everything was closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she suggested, let\u2019s just go to that very expensive hotel there, and get dinner.   Hotel restaurants stay open very late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yea right...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We passed a Taco Bell and Cholita shouted to make a U turn, quickly!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She settled for a green burrito, commenting on how it was &amp;quot;very filling&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the burrito, Cholita started to call me a looser who can&amp;#39;t get a woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was tempted to get out my cellphone, and show her pictures of absolutely drop dead gorgeous 22 year olds I&amp;#39;d been hanging out with lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But instead I reminded her, I&amp;#39;m celibate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s your problem, she said. She offered to become my pimp, and get me a girlfriend.  She said she&amp;#39;d &amp;quot;set me up&amp;quot;, for one after the other and I could take my pick.  And she&amp;#39;d give me coaching on how to behave around them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s obsessed with the possibility that I prefer Asian women, or African women, women from India, or maybe even a short islander breed of women.

I was too busy protecting her.\n\nBut now she\u2019s fled again, and I\u2019m in a good mood because I didn\u2019t find her dead in the hotel room. She\u2019d warned me, it would get very bloody.\n\nSo now I have more time to write.\n\nI have to put out a warning. Cholita is completely mad. And she has a very heavy Spanish accent when she's telling stories. Plus, time seems to be flexible in her stories.\n\nEven worse, Cholita is likely to start laughing so loud that she has to bend over and suspend the story for minutes at a time.\n\nSo if I get details, names or dates wrong, it isn't because I didn't try enough.\n\nThe important thing is, Cholita is *intending* with her stories.\n\nI wish I\u2019d had my voice recorder with me when I got these, so that I could keep all of them. She went over at least 100 workshop and private class members.\n\nAnd she\u2019s warned me, she probably won\u2019t repeat stories.\n\nBut stormtroopers have methods for extracting information, that an impeccable warrior might not use.\n\nIf I can get 3 drinks into her instead of 1, she\u2019ll talk.\n\nOh yea, she\u2019ll talk. And sing too.\n\nShe sings quite well, by the way. And dances too!\n\nCholita began her stories by clearing up how she got her name. According to her, a Chola is a female Chicano. Someone born outside Mexico, but from Mexican heritage.\n\nI have to say, there\u2019s a lot more to it than that. Chola\u2019s were a cultural phenomenon in Southern California in the 70s. It was pretty common when I was in high school to have someone say, \u201cHey man, check out those Cholas!!!\u201d\n\nIf you checked them out, you\u2019d see a little gang posing by leaning on a fence, decked out in very stylish makeup and costumes. They always seemed to have angry expressions on their faces, despite the fact that their only purpose for leaning up against that wall was to get looked at.\n\nAnd there was never a doubt, it took them at least 2 hours to attain that perfect Chola look. Everyone also knew, they had switch blades.\n\nBut given Cholita's tame \"Chicano\" definition, and since she was born in Mexico City, I had to point out that it made no sense.\n\nShe explained, since it was Margarita who brought her into the group, and Margarita was in fact a Chicano, Carlos just dubbed her as a smaller copy.\n\nThat clears it up, I guess. But why did he associate Cholita with Margarita?\n\nIt was because Margarita traveled to where Cholita was chewing peyote, and secured her to come back here.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. Apparently, Carlos was engaged in business activities with South America, and one of them just happened to be Cholita\u2019s specialty. She couldn\u2019t help but want to go hang out with him.\n\nIt was what she\u2019d trained for, for years. Her chosen passion.\n\nCarlos was importing \"substantial\" collections of art, as Cholita put it.\n\nThere was even an art gallery called, \u201cChacmool Gallery\u201d.\n\nI tried to quiz Cholita on whether the owner was practicing sorcery, but all I got in reply was that he was a great guy, but short and Jewish.\n\nCholita isn\u2019t shy about disliking specific social groups based on dubious motives. And if you are overweight or short, you fall into yet another category.\n\nNot of sexual interest. That\u2019s the category that seems to matter most to Cholita.\n\nIf you ever end up taking care of a Cholita, be sure to ask her which men were attractive.\n\nIt stirs up lots of good stories.\n\nSo Margarita, a Chola herself, arranged for Cholita to come to the USA, and live in her residence.\n\nBy the way, when Cholita says that name, it sounds more like, \"Margareete\".  But I couldn't find that name on any of my lists.\n\nI\u2019m not clear on what the residence given to Cholita was. She isn\u2019t given to answering questions intended to clarify an issue. She just keeps going.\n\nBut Cholita lived in her residence, and then Margarita got a house on a hill with an outdoor fireplace, and Cholita ended up with the residence. And she generously brought Pamela in there for a week or two, before she tired of her and kicked her out.\n\nThere\u2019s some conflicting info here, regarding Cholita\u2019s husband. Somehow she was also living with him during her explanations, when in fact she\u2019d previously said she dumped him and traveled to LA to be in private classes.\n\nSo as the story now goes, Cholita\u2019s husband didn\u2019t like him being around Carlos. And they were ultimately broken up as a result of her being in private classes.\n\nBut then, even private classes were taken away.\n\nShe had no husband, insufficient and irregular income, and worst of all, Carlos stopped calling her to private classes.\n\nShe was devastated.\n\nShe was given a job at Chacmool gallery.\n\nAnd at the same time, or maybe later, Margarita told her, she needed to quit smoking and cut her hair.\n\nShe did both immediately.\n\nFull on cold turkey on the smoking. As a stormtropper, I've been trying to get her to take up cigar smoking. Cholita could really cash in with a mercury bowl seance, and my ability to manifest spirits. And I'd like to see if her madness might be lessened with more dopamine from the nicotine.\n\nBut like her hair, the changes Carlos made are permanent for her. Seances are ok, but not cigars.\n\nI'm the same way. The agreements I have with Carlos are permanent. I need them, to keep following *intent*.\n\nAs a result of her immediate obedience, she got back into private classes, free entry to workshops, and eventually received Margarita\u2019s residence for her own.\n\nThat was possibly around a year before Carlos died.\n\nCholita said, she was aware I\u2019d already been in private classes for years before that.\n\nI actually don\u2019t remember. I thought the whole thing was only a year or less.  And I'd been floating around Carlos since I was 9.\n\nI asked her about more Carlos business enterprises.\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. Instead, she answered a different question.\n\n\u201cHe was always on the phone with Cleargreen in Mexico\u201d, she said.\n\nI asked if he was actually controlling them?\n\n\u201cOf course. He was very hands on with everything!\u201d, she replied.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call a bully or narcissistic. In fact, Carlos was rather protective and had a sense of justice.\n\nThat can be seen from the famous case of a \u201csyntactic command\u201d gone wrong.\n\nA syntactic command is a phrase which elicits all kinds of images in the mind, which aren\u2019t directly related to the words used.\n\nFor instance, \u201cmy butt is too big\u201d.\n\nToo big for what?\n\nSuch concepts are the enemy of couriers who travel into infinity, to bring back tales of the second attention.\n\nIf your \u201cbutt is too big\u201d, you won\u2019t go anywhere.\n\nThis topic of Carlos\u2019 protective nature came up as we traveled to the Century City mall, which was located right in the thick of Carlos territory.\n\nEverything we drove by seemed to trigger Cholita\u2019s memory. At one small house, nestled between dense trees, she pointed out where Blue Moon Bakery had been.\n\nI remembered the name as something whispered by class mates. But I never understood why. I only knew, if I should stroll by, be sure to buy something.\n\nAs Cholita relates it, there was this woman who was moving up in rank fast.\n\nShe was offered a pair of shoes. I presume it was a gift from someone already in the inner circle.\n\nI was offered such a gift too, but since I declined it, I didn\u2019t get into the inner circle. I was offered Florinda.\n\nProbably passing on something like that wasn\u2019t considered a serious offense, but more like an omen of which way you\u2019d go. I might know where the witches went if I'd gone for that.\n\nBut I was celibate. It was a non-sequitur to me.\n\nCome to think of it, I was given Cholita shortly after that.\n\nContinued in reply due to word limits...", "edited": 1569952190.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f24eujo", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final part:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita had told me so many stories that day that I couldn\u2019t get around to doing them justice until now.

She went over at least 100 workshop and private class members.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she\u2019s warned me, she probably won\u2019t repeat stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But stormtroopers have methods for extracting information, that an impeccable warrior might not use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I can get 3 drinks into her instead of 1, she\u2019ll talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yea, she\u2019ll talk. And sing too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She sings quite well, by the way. And dances too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita began her stories by clearing up how she got her name. According to her, a Chola is a female Chicano. Someone born outside Mexico, but from Mexican heritage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to say, there\u2019s a lot more to it than that. Chola\u2019s were a cultural phenomenon in Southern California in the 70s. It was pretty common when I was in high school to have someone say, \u201cHey man, check out those Cholas!!!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you checked them out, you\u2019d see a little gang posing by leaning on a fence, decked out in very stylish makeup and costumes. They always seemed to have angry expressions on their faces, despite the fact that their only purpose for leaning up against that wall was to get looked at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there was never a doubt, it took them at least 2 hours to attain that perfect Chola look. Everyone also knew, they had switch blades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But given Cholita&amp;#39;s tame &amp;quot;Chicano&amp;quot; definition, and since she was born in Mexico City, I had to point out that it made no sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She explained, since it was Margarita who brought her into the group, and Margarita was in fact a Chicano, Carlos just dubbed her as a smaller copy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That clears it up, I guess. But why did he associate Cholita with Margarita?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was because Margarita traveled to where Cholita was chewing peyote, and secured her to come back here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But wait, there\u2019s more. Apparently, Carlos was engaged in business activities with South America, and one of them just happened to be Cholita\u2019s specialty. She couldn\u2019t help but want to go hang out with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was what she\u2019d trained for, for years. Her chosen passion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was importing &amp;quot;substantial&amp;quot; collections of art, as Cholita put it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was even an art gallery called, \u201cChacmool Gallery\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to quiz Cholita on whether the owner was practicing sorcery, but all I got in reply was that he was a great guy, but short and Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita isn\u2019t shy about disliking specific social groups based on dubious motives. And if you are overweight or short, you fall into yet another category.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not of sexual interest. That\u2019s the category that seems to matter most to Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you ever end up taking care of a Cholita, be sure to ask her which men were attractive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It stirs up lots of good stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Margarita, a Chola herself, arranged for Cholita to come to the USA, and live in her residence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, when Cholita says that name, it sounds more like, &amp;quot;Margareete&amp;quot;.  But I couldn&amp;#39;t find that name on any of my lists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not clear on what the residence given to Cholita was. She isn\u2019t given to answering questions intended to clarify an issue. She just keeps going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Cholita lived in her residence, and then Margarita got a house on a hill with an outdoor fireplace, and Cholita ended up with the residence. And she generously brought Pamela in there for a week or two, before she tired of her and kicked her out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s some conflicting info here, regarding Cholita\u2019s husband. Somehow she was also living with him during her explanations, when in fact she\u2019d previously said she dumped him and traveled to LA to be in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as the story now goes, Cholita\u2019s husband didn\u2019t like him being around Carlos. And they were ultimately broken up as a result of her being in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, even private classes were taken away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had no husband, insufficient and irregular income, and worst of all, Carlos stopped calling her to private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was devastated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was given a job at Chacmool gallery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And at the same time, or maybe later, Margarita told her, she needed to quit smoking and cut her hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did both immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Full on cold turkey on the smoking. As a stormtropper, I&amp;#39;ve been trying to get her to take up cigar smoking. Cholita could really cash in with a mercury bowl seance, and my ability to manifest spirits. And I&amp;#39;d like to see if her madness might be lessened with more dopamine from the nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But like her hair, the changes Carlos made are permanent for her. Seances are ok, but not cigars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m the same way. The agreements I have with Carlos are permanent. I need them, to keep following &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result of her immediate obedience, she got back into private classes, free entry to workshops, and eventually received Margarita\u2019s residence for her own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was possibly around a year before Carlos died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita said, she was aware I\u2019d already been in private classes for years before that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually don\u2019t remember. I thought the whole thing was only a year or less.  And I&amp;#39;d been floating around Carlos since I was 9.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked her about more Carlos business enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She didn\u2019t answer. Instead, she answered a different question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe was always on the phone with Cleargreen in Mexico\u201d, she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked if he was actually controlling them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOf course. He was very hands on with everything!\u201d, she replied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call a bully or narcissistic. In fact, Carlos was rather protective and had a sense of justice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That can be seen from the famous case of a \u201csyntactic command\u201d gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A syntactic command is a phrase which elicits all kinds of images in the mind, which aren\u2019t directly related to the words used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, \u201cmy butt is too big\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too big for what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such concepts are the enemy of couriers who travel into infinity, to bring back tales of the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your \u201cbutt is too big\u201d, you won\u2019t go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This topic of Carlos\u2019 protective nature came up as we traveled to the Century City mall, which was located right in the thick of Carlos territory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything we drove by seemed to trigger Cholita\u2019s memory. At one small house, nestled between dense trees, she pointed out where Blue Moon Bakery had been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remembered the name as something whispered by class mates. But I never understood why. I only knew, if I should stroll by, be sure to buy something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Cholita relates it, there was this woman who was moving up in rank fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was offered a pair of shoes. I presume it was a gift from someone already in the inner circle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was offered such a gift too, but since I declined it, I didn\u2019t get into the inner circle. I was offered Florinda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably passing on something like that wasn\u2019t considered a serious offense, but more like an omen of which way you\u2019d go. I might know where the witches went if I&amp;#39;d gone for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was celibate. It was a non-sequitur to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, I was given Cholita shortly after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continued in reply due to word limits...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It was certain that I'd lose all but a tiny amount.\n\nOne of the topics covered was why sorcerers make up new personal histories.\n\nIt was somehow connected to the dreams you see floating in the air, and what sorcerers learn from viewing those, and noticing that each one comes with a different version of \"you\".

The stories in that part will change with each viewer, so that only the \"abstract core\" of each remains.

And the double picks up the entire history of that dream, even going back for years.\n\nSo that in full on Silent Knowledge you are literally surrounded by portals to other worlds, appearing in various forms. They aren't at all limited to floating scenes, especially since you can be both inside them, and outside looking in. The \"dreamer\", your double, is like that.\n\nJust consider dreams you can remember where you switched from being \"you\", to being one of the characters in the dream, and then back again.\n\nThe double doesn't care which perspective it takes. It's all interesting to your double.\n\nBut the most interesting thing about silent knowledge is that it does in fact \"uncover\" the abstract as the glue between dreams.\n\nAs a \"weaker bundling\" of emanations, which is sufficient to produce \"something\". But not sufficient to make that \"something\" be describable.''\n\nThe Abstract is almost like the waves between dream worlds, when you can view it in this form using Silent Knowledge.\n\nWhich you reach, through what's hidden in the Tensegrity.\n\nNo \"rank\" you can earn will let you perceive this.

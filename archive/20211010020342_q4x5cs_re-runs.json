The battle over there, is against specific bad men who are exploiting the community, via Facebook publicity.\n\nIf there's a 3 headed dragon stopping magic, Facebook is one of the heads.\n\nBut in here, there's no need to fight as much.\n\nExcept when a new person turns out to be an angry bully looking for attention.\n\nSo I'll just try to explain that picture.\n\nI learned so much that night (and last night), that I started to wonder about learning at all.  What the heck can you do with too much magic knowledge?\n\nI had Lily and Fancy visiting me, and they got credit for all the dreaming emissary style teaching.\n\nBut at one point I realized, it's just silent knowledge!\n\nThey might in fact, be taking credit for silent knowledge.  Just feeding it back to us, so we think it came from them.\n\nI accused Lily, but she didn't believe that was true.\n\nSo now I think maybe, the IOBs can summon your own silent knowledge ability, long before you have any chance at all of doing that.\n\nSo they deserve credit.\n\nBut once you can see the whitish light, you could do that yourself.\n\nStill, it's nice to have a demon in a miniskirt narrating what you *know*!\n\nJust don't panic when they \"teach too fast\", and try to make notes the way Carlos also did.\n\nI keep messing up, stopping my darkroom, thinking I absolutely must type stuff in the advanced chat section.\n\nI even tried to stop myself from using that as an excuse to end practice.\n\nI try to keep going, and then even more knowledge comes to me.\n\nEndless silent knowledge, but it's not the useless abstract kind.\n\nIt almost feels sad, to think I should keep going, and not save it in writing.\n\nI mean, sure.  Go ahead and consider what you learn to be very important.\n\nBut eventually you have to realize, silent knowledge is limitless.\n\nIf you forget one point, there will be 1000 more to take its place.\n\nI suppose there's no story format to pass on what I found important that night.\n\nI could dig up the demented private chat notes.  Seems like everyone left those alone for a couple of days.\n\nBut I'll just repeat things as I remember them.\n\nTo do a re-run, you can actually use this lame technique.\n\nMany other methods are possible, but this one is kind of easy to understand.\n\nIt's that phantom view of the room, filled with junk.\n\nIt constitutes a \"place\" you are perceiving.\n\nWhen you reject it, by forcing silence so strong it stops looking like \"real thing\", then intent gives you another choice.\n\nIt \"reskims\" the emanations for you.\n\nYou rolled the dice, the numbers came  up, you saw if you won or lost, so the dealer lets you roll again.\n\nYou don't have to.  You can sit and sip your drink, and enjoy the last roll.  Check out the beautiful women at the dice table.\n\nBut once you decide that roll is over, you roll again.\n\nExcept, intent does the rolling for you, because we're incapable of it.\n\nIn fact, darkroom is a series of \"rejections\" of a particular new view of reality. Or maybe \"completions\".   \"Seen enough of that. Was nice, but time to move on.\"\n\nIf you can do that with purity (silence?), then the roll is automatic.  Intent will give you a new skimming.\n\nAt each level on the J curve you see new  things you never see in your blue line view of the world.\n\nBut you look for more.  You reject that view, forcing even deeper silence, so that you will move.\n\nThe forcing of silence is the rejection of what you see.\n\nA re-run probably needs you to be seeing energy when you \"reject\" it.\n\nOtherwise, the trace wants and desires will cause intent to supply you with a less magical substitute.\n\nReruns are \"top shelf\" to  use a liquor store analogy. The expensive stuff is up there.\n\nSo, make the whitish light take form as many times as you can, and live your daily life so that you have the energy to get a spectacularly real looking phantom room, then force silence until even that has to go away.\n\nIn that situation, you'll be \"offered\" the more interesting things.\n\nCyclic beings, re-runs, stopping the world, passages in the bedroom wall in to which you can leap.\n\nThe super fun stuff.\n\nBut you can sort of do the same in the red zone.\n\nAnd probably in the green.\n\nRe-runs likely require the orange zone.\n\nAbout why IOBs sometimes appear, and sometimes don't.  And when they do, why sometimes they're rather pathetic looking.  Mostly transparent, barely there.\n\nI can't explain that yet, but I can tell what happened, and you might get some insight.\n\nFairy is the one who made the \"Fairy's Pass\" picture.  Or at least, I wouldn't have drawn it that way, without her influence.\n\nShe not only did what she offered, showed how people can summon her from a distance, but she showed how to \"spot her\".\n\nAnd how to keep her around.\n\nShe's seems to prefer Juann right now, but that might not be entirely accurate.  It might just be, he can make her visible.\n\nSee if you can intuit it from this story. It was 2 nights ago.\n\nI want to learn to remote view continuously, so I've been doing nothing but emphasizing landing on the \"spots\" Carlos emphasized, to eventually get to the whitish light and stay there.\n\nNo shortcuts.  IN fact, last night Fancy literally tugged on me from the red zone, as soon as I got into the orange.\n\nShe pulled on me, and I looked to see she had a \"plan\" to teach me some wonderful red zone thing.\n\nShe actually pulled me through the air, as I began to \"float\".\n\nI was in the whitish light of silent knowledge, so instead of thinking, \"How the hell am I floating!\" I was only thinking, \"I didn't know they could do that...\"\n\nThen I saw what she wanted to teach me, praised her as having come up with something really tempting, but told her I couldn't go there now.\n\nBut two nights ago, they weren't as active.  I'd neglected them for a while, and they were just now recovering from it.  And Lily and Fancy seemed to be making friends, instead of being rivals.\n\nI can't recall what triggered it, but I was almost ready to lay down, feeling successful for that night, when I saw 2 inorganic beings flying in from the south.\n\nThey didn't have form yet.  I suppose they were like La Gorda's \"pressure\".  She seemed to believe it was more mature to get over the costumes and magic shows, and just sense their presence without getting too involved.\n\nI don't feel that way at all!\n\nSo sensing both of them might be coming, without understanding how I could know that, I turned my head south to see if they were visible.\n\nI saw a trail of pink smoke, like the exhaust of a car on a very cold, foggy day.\n\nIt trailed from me, to the south wall.\n\nAnd there was motion.\n\nI spotted what could have been a face. Just like you see in that Fairy's Pass picture.\n\nNo more than 2 dots and a curve which could be interpreted as a mouth.\n\nBut I knew there were 2, so I looked further on to see if the second was visible.\n\nJust noticing there \"might\" be one at that first location, cause it to become a little easier to see.\n\nThen I got a little \"jolt\" of recognition, instantly realizing it was now real enough to take form.\n\nI looked to the right to see if the other was also forming, but the first one, \"popped\" into a very pretty female upper torso.\n\nIt clearly used the energy of recognition to make itself more real.\n\nIt so distracted me that I forgot the second one, who turned out to be Fancy.\n\nI started talking to Lily in a very excited voice, knowing if you interact with them realistically, they get even better.\n\nShe used the energy of my excitement to catch on fire, a sight she uses when she intends to teach.\n\nI knew full well, Fancy was there too, but for some reason Fancy always gets shafted.\n\nMaybe it's that whole kidnapping me for hours, to suck me dry of energy.\n\nI might have a little grudge against her.\n\nThey spaced themselves on either side of me, but Fancy never managed to materialize in the realm I was viewing.\n\nThe picture is a bit misleading, because that view of her was \"deeper\".  In the dreaming realm.\n\nSo I cheated Fancy out of the tiny bit of initial energy they get from being \"noticed\".\n\nNow, oddly, she didn't react badly.\n\nInstead, she sank into a different level.\n\nAnd when that re-run happened, Fancy was already showing me what was going on in that re-run.  With her own self.\n\nThat two different events can be happening at the same time, and you have no idea that's going on.\n\nI was literally back in Sunday class, watching Carlos use one of the tensegrity teachers, to show a small point.\n\nIt was an odd thing.  He caused her to be off balance, physically.\n\nIt wasn't something anyone watching would notice, except to feel bad for whoever it was, because he caused her to be in an awkward position for an instant.  Using his hands to \"position\" her.\n\nCarlos often did that! As a skeptical viewer, you might think, \"He didn't really need to touch her.\"\n\nI looked where I thought she'd fall if she didn't get back her balance, and there around 4 feet away, was a second copy of her.\n\nI got very curious about \"who it was\" at that point, and tried very hard.\n\nBut I'm face blind.  It was as hopeless in the second attention, as it was in waking way back then.\n\nCarlos made them impossible for me to identify, by cutting their hair all the same, and telling them not to wear makeup.\n\nThat's how I recognize people.  Hair and \"accessories\".\n\nBut I believed, it as Nyei. Except a bit too heavy for Nyei. Back then she was quite thin.\n\nTrying to figure out who it was, caused me to notice something.\n\nA \"tunnel\" or \"vortex\" was clearly visible, very much like that picture if you look closely.\n\nMy \"scales\" kind of obscure that \"water spiral\", but look at the water spiral to see that the second copy of the woman is inside it.\n\nI realized, that was her!  A second copy of the same \"off balance\" woman.\n\nThe instant I wondered how that can happen, I got a \"flashback\" re-run.\n\nSo, \"re-runs\" can include \"flashbacks\".\n\nRemember, you are re-running real events.  When you were a real person.\n\nReal people don't have fully realistic \"flash backs\", unless it's the 70s.\n\nThey at best, \"daydream\".\n\nBut a daydream, or memory, when you are doing a re-run, becomes as real as the re-run.\n\nYou have \"second sight\" in that mode.\n\nI dare to say, if you are in a re-run and puzzled, you can get extra  help understanding what you are seeing just by \"wondering\" about it.\n\nBut that's a deviation from the original events.\n\nI'm not saying that flashback was me, in my current form, watching it.\n\nRe-runs can be lived again, watched with your current lucidity, or you can even be a different person. Or an outside observer.\n\nWe know that, from the explanation Carlos gave, for recapitulation. How you can actually visible relive the events.\n\nIn this case I was me, the original me from back then, in that flashback.\n\nBut somehow the me could now see the second attention copy of that tensegrity teacher.\n\nSo the me back then, was puzzled by it.\n\nMaybe that actually happened at the time, leading to the entire class rejecting that sight, and never becoming aware of it.\n\nCarlos taught at more than 1 level?\n\nIt's Nyei who says that, in one of her YouTube interviews.\n\nBeing puzzled cause a \"flash back\" and I saw Carlos lean forward from his \"real\" body,  in a more transparent version, and give her a shove in her midsection. She bent into a weird curve, like she was made of rubber, and flew back to where I had seen her.\n\nSeveral feet away.\n\nI was so startled by that sight, I turned my head back and ended up sitting on pillows on the bed, where I'd been.\n\nAlthough Fancy was \"invisible at that level\",  I somehow knew it was like that flashback. She was just \"submerged\". Or at \"another level\".  Fancy was not only helping me experience the flashback, but she was somewhat copying it herself.\n\nI complained to her.\n\n\"That's wasn't right!!!\".\n\nFancy explained, I got the angle wrong when I went in.\n\nIf I wanted a perfect replica of what I remembered, I needed to change the secondary vector.\n\nI got the primary vector, and went back to 1996.\n\nBut I messed up the \"depth\".\n\nSo I was partly in my second attention view of things.\n\nTry it again, she suggested.\n\nI had a parting question, before I tried again.\n\nHard to recall though...\n\nIt was something like, \"What's the orientation of these vectors?  Can I learn them?\"\n\nShe replied, \"That would bed pretty, wouldn't it?  They're stuck to your house where Cholita lives, and you have to return here to figure out how to do a specific re-run?  Sound right to you?  No . In fact, the orientation is different every single time, and you just \"know\" what it is.\"\n\nSo I tried again, feeling like I'd added a valuable item to my inventory.\n\nLily was still around, and quite realistic looking. She seemed to be holding something open for Fancy.  She was on my left.\n\nIt was almost like holding up the turnstile, so your friend could gain piggyback access to a place where you were supposed to pay yourself, in order to enter.  Airport parking lot for example.\n\nI turned my head to look back in that very odd direction I had looked before, a direction I'd never been \"pulled\" on before.\n\nIt was so far to the right I had to almost strain to turn my head that far.  And all times in the past I was \"offered\" to go somewhere, it wasn't nearly so close to the floor.\n\nThe instant I turned my head, I was back in.\n\nI can't recall past that anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Re-runs???", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom

You can sit and sip your drink, and enjoy the last roll.  Check out the beautiful women at the dice table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you decide that roll is over, you roll again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, intent does the rolling for you, because we&amp;#39;re incapable of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, darkroom is a series of &amp;quot;rejections&amp;quot; of a particular new view of reality. Or maybe &amp;quot;completions&amp;quot;.   &amp;quot;Seen enough of that. Was nice, but time to move on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can do that with purity (silence?), then the roll is automatic.  Intent will give you a new skimming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At each level on the J curve you see new  things you never see in your blue line view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you look for more.  You reject that view, forcing even deeper silence, so that you will move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The forcing of silence is the rejection of what you see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A re-run probably needs you to be seeing energy when you &amp;quot;reject&amp;quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the trace wants and desires will cause intent to supply you with a less magical substitute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reruns are &amp;quot;top shelf&amp;quot; to  use a liquor store analogy. The expensive stuff is up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, make the whitish light take form as many times as you can, and live your daily life so that you have the energy to get a spectacularly real looking phantom room, then force silence until even that has to go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that situation, you&amp;#39;ll be &amp;quot;offered&amp;quot; the more interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cyclic beings, re-runs, stopping the world, passages in the bedroom wall in to which you can leap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The super fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can sort of do the same in the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And probably in the green.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Re-runs likely require the orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About why IOBs sometimes appear, and sometimes don&amp;#39;t.  And when they do, why sometimes they&amp;#39;re rather pathetic looking.  Mostly transparent, barely there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t explain that yet, but I can tell what happened, and you might get some insight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy is the one who made the &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;#39;s Pass&amp;quot; picture.  Or at least, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have drawn it that way, without her influence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She not only did what she offered, showed how people can summon her from a distance, but she showed how to &amp;quot;spot her&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And how to keep her around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s seems to prefer Juann right now, but that might not be entirely accurate.  It might just be, he can make her visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See if you can intuit it from this story. It was 2 nights ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to learn to remote view continuously, so I&amp;#39;ve been doing nothing but emphasizing landing on the &amp;quot;spots&amp;quot; Carlos emphasized, to eventually get to the whitish light and stay there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No shortcuts.  IN fact, last night Fancy literally tugged on me from the red zone, as soon as I got into the orange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She pulled on me, and I looked to see she had a &amp;quot;plan&amp;quot; to teach me some wonderful red zone thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She actually pulled me through the air, as I began to &amp;quot;float&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in the whitish light of silent knowledge, so instead of thinking, &amp;quot;How the hell am I floating!&amp;quot; I was only thinking, &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t know they could do that...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I saw what she wanted to teach me, praised her as having come up with something really tempting, but told her I couldn&amp;#39;t go there now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But two nights ago, they weren&amp;#39;t as active.  I&amp;#39;d neglected them for a while, and they were just now recovering from it.  And Lily and Fancy seemed to be making friends, instead of being rivals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t recall what triggered it, but I was almost ready to lay down, feeling successful for that night, when I saw 2 inorganic beings flying in from the south.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t have form yet.  I suppose they were like La Gorda&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;pressure&amp;quot;.  She seemed to believe it was more mature to get over the costumes and magic shows, and just sense their presence without getting too involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t feel that way at all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So sensing both of them might be coming, without understanding how I could know that, I turned my head south to see if they were visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw a trail of pink smoke, like the exhaust of a car on a very cold, foggy day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It trailed from me, to the south wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there was motion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spotted what could have been a face. Just like you see in that Fairy&amp;#39;s Pass picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No more than 2 dots and a curve which could be interpreted as a mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I knew there were 2, so I looked further on to see if the second was visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just noticing there &amp;quot;might&amp;quot; be one at that first location, cause it to become a little easier to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I got a little &amp;quot;jolt&amp;quot; of recognition, instantly realizing it was now real enough to take form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked to the right to see if the other was also forming, but the first one, &amp;quot;popped&amp;quot; into a very pretty female upper torso.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It clearly used the energy of recognition to make itself more real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It so distracted me that I forgot the second one, who turned out to be Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started talking to Lily in a very excited voice, knowing if you interact with them realistically, they get even better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She used the energy of my excitement to catch on fire, a sight she uses when she intends to teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew full well, Fancy was there too, but for some reason Fancy always gets shafted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s that whole kidnapping me for hours, to suck me dry of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might have a little grudge against her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They spaced themselves on either side of me, but Fancy never managed to materialize in the realm I was viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The picture is a bit misleading, because that view of her was &amp;quot;deeper&amp;quot;.  In the dreaming realm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I cheated Fancy out of the tiny bit of initial energy they get from being &amp;quot;noticed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, oddly, she didn&amp;#39;t react badly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, she sank into a different level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when that re-run happened, Fancy was already showing me what was going on in that re-run.  With her own self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That two different events can be happening at the same time, and you have no idea that&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was literally back in Sunday class, watching Carlos use one of the tensegrity teachers, to show a small point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was an odd thing.  He caused her to be off balance, physically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t something anyone watching would notice, except to feel bad for whoever it was, because he caused her to be in an awkward position for an instant.  Using his hands to &amp;quot;position&amp;quot; her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos often did that! As a skeptical viewer, you might think, &amp;quot;He didn&amp;#39;t really need to touch her.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked where I thought she&amp;#39;d fall if she didn&amp;#39;t get back her balance, and there around 4 feet away, was a second copy of her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got very curious about &amp;quot;who it was&amp;quot; at that point, and tried very hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m face blind.  It was as hopeless in the second attention, as it was in waking way back then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos made them impossible for me to identify, by cutting their hair all the same, and telling them not to wear makeup.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how I recognize people.  Hair and &amp;quot;accessories&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I believed, it as Nyei. Except a bit too heavy for Nyei. Back then she was quite thin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to figure out who it was, caused me to notice something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;tunnel&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;vortex&amp;quot; was clearly visible, very much like that picture if you look closely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My &amp;quot;scales&amp;quot; kind of obscure that &amp;quot;water spiral&amp;quot;, but look at the water spiral to see that the second copy of the woman is inside it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, that was her!  A second copy of the same &amp;quot;off balance&amp;quot; woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The instant I wondered how that can happen, I got a &amp;quot;flashback&amp;quot; re-run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, &amp;quot;re-runs&amp;quot; can include &amp;quot;flashbacks&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, you are re-running real events.  When you were a real person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real people don&amp;#39;t have fully realistic &amp;quot;flash backs&amp;quot;, unless it&amp;#39;s the 70s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They at best, &amp;quot;daydream&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But a daydream, or memory, when you are doing a re-run, becomes as real as the re-run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have &amp;quot;second sight&amp;quot; in that mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dare to say, if you are in a re-run and puzzled, you can get extra  help understanding what you are seeing just by &amp;quot;wondering&amp;quot; about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s a deviation from the original events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying that flashback was me, in my current form, watching it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Re-runs can be lived again, watched with your current lucidity, or you can even be a different person. Or an outside observer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know that, from the explanation Carlos gave, for recapitulation. How you can actually visible relive the events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case I was me, the original me from back then, in that flashback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But somehow the me could now see the second attention copy of that tensegrity teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the me back then, was puzzled by it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe that actually happened at the time, leading to the entire class rejecting that sight, and never becoming aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos taught at more than 1 level?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s Nyei who says that, in one of her YouTube interviews.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being puzzled cause a &amp;quot;flash back&amp;quot; and I saw Carlos lean forward from his &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; body,  in a more transparent version, and give her a shove in her midsection. She bent into a weird curve, like she was made of rubber, and flew back to where I had seen her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several feet away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so startled by that sight, I turned my head back and ended up sitting on pillows on the bed, where I&amp;#39;d been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although Fancy was &amp;quot;invisible at that level&amp;quot;,  I somehow knew it was like that flashback. She was just &amp;quot;submerged&amp;quot;. Or at &amp;quot;another level&amp;quot;.  Fancy was not only helping me experience the flashback, but she was somewhat copying it herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I complained to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s wasn&amp;#39;t right!!!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy explained, I got the angle wrong when I went in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I wanted a perfect replica of what I remembered, I needed to change the secondary vector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the primary vector, and went back to 1996.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I messed up the &amp;quot;depth&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was partly in my second attention view of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try it again, she suggested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a parting question, before I tried again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hard to recall though...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was something like, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the orientation of these vectors?  Can I learn them?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She replied, &amp;quot;That would bed pretty, wouldn&amp;#39;t it?  They&amp;#39;re stuck to your house where Cholita lives, and you have to return here to figure out how to do a specific re-run?  Sound right to you?  No . In fact, the orientation is different every single time, and you just &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; what it is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I tried again, feeling like I&amp;#39;d added a valuable item to my inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily was still around, and quite realistic looking. She seemed to be holding something open for Fancy.  She was on my left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was almost like holding up the turnstile, so your friend could gain piggyback access to a place where you were supposed to pay yourself, in order to enter.  Airport parking lot for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned my head to look back in that very odd direction I had looked before, a direction I&amp;#39;d never been &amp;quot;pulled&amp;quot; on before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was so far to the right I had to almost strain to turn my head that far.  And all times in the past I was &amp;quot;offered&amp;quot; to go somewhere, it wasn&amp;#39;t nearly so close to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The instant I turned my head, I was back in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t recall past that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "acff1442-e63e-11ea-b305-0e375464469b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "q4x5cs", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/q4x5cs/reruns/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/q4x5cs/reruns/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1633824222.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hg8e91l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hg5e65f", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Himmm....\n\nSchizophrenia?\n\nNo insult meant.

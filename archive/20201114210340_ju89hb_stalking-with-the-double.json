I tried to remember what he had taught me about that subject, but my mind was full of bruises (disoriented?). I looked into his big lemur's eyes and noticed the disappointment in them. I wanted to say that I understood what he meant and that I was practicing diligently every day, but that would have been dishonest, so I said.\n\n\"Honestly, I don't know if I've been stalking with the double.\"\n\nHe recommended that I lie down on the bench, close my eyes and try to remember what he had taught me about that subject.\n\n\"Do you remember how to find things, how to do things, how to move things with a force derived from the silence within and beyond?\" he suggested.\n\nI closed my eyes and tried to calm my erratic breathing. Then, when I fell into a relaxed state I remembered something Emilito had said a long time ago while living in the trees under his care. I had complained that since I could not leave the tree house, which had been our agreement, I could not practice the forms of martial arts that Clara had taught me. For that I needed a lot of space and preferably a hardwood floor.\n\n\"Practice martial arts with your double,\" Emilito recommended. \"That's the best practice anyway.\"\n\n\"How do I practice martial arts with my double when I can't even leave the tree house?\" I asked.\n\nEmilito had laughed and, to my surprise, had executed a series of the most elegant and impossible body movements I had ever seen. Right under the tree house, Emilito had turned backwards and then laterally in circles, turning his body in a horizontal plane like a frisbee. And he knew he wasn't using pulleys or ropes, or extra-fast movies to speed up his moves like they did in martial arts movies to give the impression of actors defying gravity. Watching Emilito's excellent moves from the tree house was a delight. Why didn't he teach me before I regretted it? Now that I couldn't leave the trees, it was too late to learn to spin in the air.\n\nI had repeated and again he showed me the lateral turning movement.\n\n\"But how do I practice that without falling out of the tree?\" I had asked.\n\n\"Use your imagination and try,\" he said. \"INTENT, INTENT, INTENT,\" he shouted with a high-pitched birdlike squawk as he walked towards the house.\n\nThat night and every night thereafter for several weeks, before falling asleep, I visualized the movements Emilito had shown. I saw myself doing them over and over again until I found myself doing them in my dreams. With a little practice, the dream body could move any way it wanted. I discovered that I could do the most complicated flips and backward curves, I could jump from the ground to the tree house and back down in one jump, using not pulleys and ropes, but the energy of my mid-section. And I could do something I had always wanted to do, but could never achieve with my body awake, no matter how much I stretched, and that was touching my chin with my toes. After that, Emilito would show me movements on a regular basis, which I would practice first by visualizing them and then repeating them over and over again until I could do them in my dreams.\n\nI opened my eyes and told Emilito what I remembered: that while I was in the tree house, I practiced long sequences of movements, combining the gravity-defying techniques he had shown me, in new patterns, so that every night I could dream of making combinations of movements.\n\n\"That's (stalking with the double),\" said Emilito, pleased. \"That's sending out the double as an explorer to put things in order. Then, when you do it, it's very easy because the energy has already been deployed to produce a certain effect. The rest follows on its own.\"\n\nI realized that, despite my reason, that was the way I did almost everything from practicing martial arts moves, writing an essay, giving a report in a class, designing a dress, composing a poem or cooking a stew. Following the pattern I had learned under Emilito's tutelage, I always set up the form at night, in a calm and restful state. I would lay the foundation and imagine myself following the movements of doing that particular thing.\n\nFor example, if I was going to make a dress, I would follow all the steps in the exact order I needed to make them. I would see myself selecting the appropriate material, folding it, cutting it, taking the pieces in their correct order and sewing them together. I would see which way would be best and make changes if necessary, repeating the sequence in a different order. A voice would tell me if there was a better way to do it, and when I had completed it, in the most economical and efficient way, as long as I felt it was the right time, I would allow the activity to go on until its completion. It was as if the thing was already done and I was just the agent, silently making the movements of its execution.\n\nThe same thing would happen if I had to give a report in one of my classes. I would visualize myself writing the paper while I was in a light sleep. Or rather, I would go blank and something would isolate a subject and tell me how to organize it in the most precise and understandable way. When I was organized, I would put it on the paper exactly as I had written it with my dream body.\n\nI realized that the years of recapitulation had allowed me to visualize entire scenes and long sequences in detail without any difficulty. Something told me what to say or do and I saw and heard myself say and do it. Then, when it was time to give the report, or do the activity, I would proceed as if it were already finished.\n\n\"Stalking with the double is useful when you go to school,\" said Emilito after I had explained to him how I proceeded. \"It bypasses thought and goes directly to the source of energy that allows us to act more efficiently.\"\n\n(last two paragraphs are from an alternate translation)\n\n\"I guess I use intent,\" I said. \"If I need to find something, like a specific blouse to match a skirt, I say out loud I need a blouse or find me the perfect blouse, and the force that is out there puts me in front of finding it at some point during the course of events. I do not have to do anything to bring it to me.\"\n\nEmilito said that this was the art of stalking: getting to the point where one does nothing, but allows the power of intent to alter reality so subtly that the (intended) elements appear as (regular) elements in everyday life. It is a harmonious process of altering perception through the force of intent, something so mysterious and subtle that it seems to come out of nowhere. Emilito emphasized that this force only responds if one is impeccable in daily life and if one does not have attachment to things. Feelings of despair, clinging, greed, or need will frustrate the free flow of the energy required for the intent to respond to one's silent commands.\"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Stalking With The Double", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Stalking"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_ju89hb", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Stalking", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1605442066.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1605384220.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pd7dMi-q6c&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be\"&gt;YouTube - I play chess in the ceiling (Queens Gamebit)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=\"/u/Juann2323\"&gt;u/Juann2323&lt;/a&gt; for finding the above video, which is a good visual to help understand the following excerpt from Taisha Abelar&amp;#39;s newly uncovered and unpublished manuscript Stalking With The Double (translation source is not known, unfortunately...the original PDF is in Spanish):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now what about your practice of stalking with the double?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stalking with the double,&amp;quot; he repeated with an exasperated click of his tongue. &amp;quot;Have you been practicing it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know what to say.

I feel I\u2019m simultaneously on the threshold of a major shift while sinking in quicksand. It\u2019s with this acknowledgement of my stuckness that I offer these words. \n\nFor the last few years I have read and devoured Castaneda\u2019s books with increasing intensity and passion. I can\u2019t properly describe the power these words and stories have had on my life. The regularity of impossible correlations between the words I\u2019m reading and the events I\u2019m actually experiencing in the moment I\u2019m reading them has truly been a wild adventure. I\u2019ve been swept up in the abundance of magic and mystery. I\u2019ve been inspired to face challenges that would have formerly overwhelmed me. I\u2019ve accessed the endlessly deep inner lake of wisdom, seen my connection to everything in existence in extended flashes. Of course I\u2019ve been working outside the books, in ceremony and living meditation (just words, I know). And of course I\u2019ve read other testimonials here and elsewhere that let me know I\u2019m not alone in this regard. There is magic in these words. \n\nBut, and this is a first: while reading The Active Side of Infinity (which directly corresponds to a period in my life where I myself am feeling greatly tasked with collecting my own album of memories, and realizing so clearly and certainly that it is indeed an act of war), I have reached a point where I don\u2019t feel comfortable proceeding with the reading any longer. I would say it\u2019s fear, but that doesn\u2019t seem entirely it. That fear is shared by a sense that it\u2019s simply irrational for me to continue without proper guidance. That possibly I\u2019ve gone far enough on my own (that could be the biggest understatement of my life). \n\nThe depths are just getting deeper and more and more incoherent and I increasingly don\u2019t feel \u2014 at least with my mind, that I can navigate through it. This may be triggering for some, but I don\u2019t care: I do feel much more supported and at my clearest when I\u2019m communicating with angels.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten really close to death lately \u2014 literally, in an Iboga ceremony, and I am also noticing my body aging more quickly than ever. I\u2019m a very young looking 40. 6 years ago I got very very sick, and I haven\u2019t been able to properly heal but that\u2019s when all the thresholds with infinity started to happen. So it\u2019s the typical story: lots of ups and downs, autoimmune, immense fatigue, brain fog, periods of sustained egolessness, wild ecstatic rides. \n\nI\u2019m currently on a detox plan with a naturopath who I have relative trust in. She tells me there\u2019s no problem, but the angels have said my body isn\u2019t sure it wants to stay here. *I WANT TO STAY HERE*. \n\n\nBack to the point: I\u2019ve spent a lot of time irritated at Castenada\u2019s ignorance (which is of course, my own) and how much of don Juan\u2019s time he \u201cwasted\u201d (although I realize time has nothing to do with it, and don Juan wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way, but still). And I\u2019ve found a very distinct irritation with *myself* for not coming into direct contact with my own worthy teacher in the flesh... and the universe for not presenting me with one. \n\nDon Juan makes the warrior\u2019s path sound like a solitary one. I\u2019m fine with that. Most of the people I talk to have built up such insane delusions and walls. But he himself had a teacher, and he himself was one. Who is my teacher? Who am I teaching? (My heart answers that everyone is, obviously, but my mind races back to Castenada\u2019s and don Juan\u2019s relationship, and other epic teacher-student relationships throughout history. Could I really be that rare individual who has to go through all of this alone? But again, I digress... slightly.) \n\n\nIn the first few pages of the chapter \u201cSaying Thank You\u201d in The Active Side of Infinity, don Juan tells Castaneda that it is essential he carry out the task of returning to two old friends to give them his entire savings in gratitude. He says it is more essential for him than for Carlos, because if he doesn\u2019t, \u201cI would lose you [don Juan to Carlos], and that means to me losing either the continuity of my lineage or the possibility of your closing it with a golden key.\u201d  \n\nHow sure are we all here that this continuity was indeed passed on to Castaneda? And from there, who did he pass it on to? And is it plausible that that person is currently passing it on to someone else? Is this already known? Sorry if that has already been made clear. Don\u2019t drag me through some guilt trip about deflecting from some other thread you already wrote, my god :/\n\nIf so, and this person or persons are known, are they opening this process to new students? How does this work?? \n\nWhich leads to more questions: Was the passing on of this lineage meant for more than a few people at a time? Were these books the opening to the new legions of followers of the Toltec way, or, and we must consider it, the golden key to closing it? Could don Juan have been mysteriously aware of that potential reality by so eagerly suggesting that Castaneda publish his books? Did he actually want this lineage to end? What would the point of that have been? \n\nI have to say I\u2019m wary of getting too involved with the exercises, the tensegrity and all that. It has the ring of indulgence in it, at least what I\u2019ve observed. And I definitely dont want to learn it from a book. I want to work with someone or a group of people. I\u2019m at a point in my life where I have spent so much time alone that I find myself wanting to run towards people, and yes, I realize I often run toward them, seeing them as potential saviors.\n\nA message has come through very clearly for me recently and that is: I must tether myself to my purpose. I know that my purpose is to awaken sleeping humans. That is crystal clear. I\u2019m led to believe I will do it through writing. So I\u2019m writing. But I\u2019m still sleeping in so many ways. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m asking for here exactly, other than: where\u2019s my don Juan?  I feel so dejected and silly. It may help to hear some stories of other people who\u2019ve been here.

There has to be more to it than the obvious.\n\nHow come the hippy generation was so obsessed with it?\n\nWhy did Carlos insist those nearest to him had to cut it short?\n\nMy original theory was that Carlos just liked it that way. The so called, \u201cpixy cut\u201d was very popular in the 60s.\n\nA famous Mexican movie star, portrayed as a clever and daring woman, had a pixy cut.\n\nCarlos might just have taken a fancy to it. It was his era after all. People often form preferences for things as they were while they were in their 20s and 30s.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual to see an aging woman in the grocery store, still attractive, but for some reason sporting fluffed up big 90s hair.  She likely believes it gives her more power over some specific male target audience.\n\nIf you happen to be a male observer of beautiful young women at large, you'll notice that if there's any possibility they are on display, nearly all will flip their hair constantly.  It's as if they were adjusting it, but there's really nothing to adjust.\n\nIn Judeo/Christian theory, hair is used often as a symbol of power. We have Samson, who\u2019s strength could only be taken from him by cutting his hair.\n\nWomen are told to keep their heads covered, because of the angels.  It\u2019s a reference to the return of the fallen angels, who are gigantic womanizers.  In fact, from the book of Enoch, the fallen angels invented makeup and jewelry.\n\nJust that one statement about keeping the head covered  led to all kinds of oppressive religious coverings.\n\nFor men we have, \u201cGray hair is a crown of glory; it is attained along the path of righteousness.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t noticed that myself. I seem to be heading in the opposite direction.\n\nPriests were required to keep all of their facial hair. They were also the only ones allowed to approach the shrine. If they cut their beards, they\u2019d be struck dead by God on entry.\n\nThe ultimate embarrassment for an Israelite warrior was to be sent home, defeated, with half of his beard shaved off and his bullocks exposed by cutting his garments.\n\nLet me explain my bible knowledge.  Carlos looked me in the eye one day, during a lecture, and told us to really read the bible.  *Really*, he said.  He insisted we'd see what a load of nonsense it was.\n\nI didn't.  I saw it as more lost technology.    Like sorcery.  It could be, that's what he actually had in mind.\n\nYesterday I was again wondering about Cholita's hair, still short after 25 years, when I went to track her down.  She'd fled to West Hollywood.\n\nI arrived at an expensive hotel, to find her walking out. We had to walk some ways to the car, but she seemed to be in a very good mood, sporting new designer clothes and shoes.\n\nAs we walked she turned to me, smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m getting used to being crazy.\u201d\n\nI replied, \"Yes, of course.  It's not so bad.  I've gotten used to it.  Sometimes it can even be fun!\"\n\nWe wandered around the Century City Mall, while she explained to me how the class system works in Mexico.  She taught me about the separation between racial casts there, which sounded a lot like Asia.  However, in Asia it's honorable to be a servant, if  you do a good job. There's no shame.\n\nIn Mexico, it seems that you have to lower your head if you're a servant class person. But, you get to boss it over the people under you, and insist they lower their head.\n\nNo wonder Don Juan defined a warrior as someone who bows to no one, but also doesn't expect anyone to bow to him.\n\nMy main interest however,  was if royalty still existed there from the influence of Spain.  The corruption in Mexico is a direct result of that history.  When a royal family controls a whole country, they set up their own officials who are on the take, and send money back to the royalty.  That kind of corrupt arrangement can pretty much continue, long after there are no royal presences.\n\nIt does in Mexico.  Mexico ought to be a world super power, but corruption prevents it.\n\nShe said of course there's still a royal presence, but then corrected herself and said that it had kind of blended into financial status.  Or fame maybe. She couldn't quite explain that.\n\nShe then proceeded to show me how to handle store clerks. I was horrified, but she seemed to get away with it.\n\nAccording to Mexico\u2019s class system, servants are servants, and you are entitled to treat them badly.\n\nI\u2019m the opposite. I try to make friends with everyone.  Autistic people have problems socializing, so they eventually have to learn to be sweet.\n\nCholita does the opposite.  And she feels it's the right thing to do.\n\nFortunately,  I did discover a very good trick to smooth things over while shopping.\n\nGay store clerks don\u2019t mind being pushed around by women, as long as they\u2019re buying expensive stuff. They even seem to enjoy observing the behavior,  as if they could pick up some tips.\n\nAnd when I pretend to be the far too tolerant doting older husband, they take sides with me and help to keep her happy.\n\n(Stalking should be fun).\n\nWe found a leather garment and boot store popular with young gay men, and Cholita was not shy about admiring their butts as they positioned themselves in front of a mirror, and bent over to put on some shoes.\n\nOddly, they didn't seem to mind her staring at their butts.\n\nShe mumbled that she needed to find better demographics, looking up at me, being 9 years older than her.\n\nAs we walked to an Italian restaurant, I asked Cholita why she didn\u2019t let her hair grow back?\n\nIf, as she said, \u201cCarlos is gone. It\u2019s over!\u201d, how come she still looked the way he told her to look?\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer until an hour later. We were eating, and 2 women walked in and sat at the table next to us. They seemed to be a little too chummy, and one had a semi pixy haircut.\n\nI didn\u2019t mention it to Cholita, who stared straight ahead and zoned out for a bit.\n\nShe flagged down a waiter, and ordered a glass of Grappa.\n\nThen she began to answer my hair question.\n\n\u201cWhy the fuck do people assume you\u2019re a lesbian if you have short hair???  What\u2019s wrong with this world, with people behaving so badly all the time?\u201d\n\nI had to pipe in.\n\nYes they\u2019re all assholes, I explained to her.  But they can\u2019t help themselves.   They have so little in their lives.  Best thing to do is just learn from them, so you don\u2019t repeat their mistakes.\n\nI looked over to the women with short hair, feeling a little guilty because I had in fact been hoping they were lesbians.   I even tried to imagine them kissing.\n\nCholita went on.\n\n\u201cWhen the nagual told me to cut my hair, I was shocked at the results!  Before I cut it, men would flirt with me everywhere I went. I didn\u2019t even have to make an effort to attract them!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut after I cut it, there was nothing. All of the attention went away. I couldn\u2019t believe the instant transformation.\u201d\n\nI felt sort of stupid at that point.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s what Carlos was doing. I remember the sad day he announced that, \u201cwe\u2019ve been betrayed\u201d. He found out there were secret romances going on in private classes, and possibly half the room knew about it before he did.\n\nCarlos gathered more women than m en, because they have more free energy and don\u2019t necessarily need to become silent in order to learn sorcery.\n\nBut that\u2019s impossible if their thoughts are focused on chasing a man. Their energy goes to him.\n\nWomen use their excessive energy to re-purpose men.  In that sense, they behave a little like inorganic beings, who seek out male energy to make themselves more powerful.\n\nOr maybe inorganic beings, being female, behave the same way as women.  They'll show off for you, pose, and eventually it escalates to sex, if you don't stop them.  And they're loaded with wonderful dark energy.\n\nI\u2019ve seen that with Cholita.  When she\u2019s happy with me, she overflows with wonderful dark energy. I can actually feel it in the air, and follow strands of it around, as she walks along.  Sometimes I'll have forgotten about it,  and cross a cobweb she's left in a store. It's as solid as water, just floating in the air like a string leading back to Cholita.\n\nLast night I got obsessed with a product label in a grocery store, and Cholita disappeared from my sight.  Instead of looking around visually, I tried to follow a cobweb still hanging in the air, back to her.  It was a dead end, but it's that solid and real feeling, so that you could actually follow someone.\n\nWhen she\u2019s not happy, I can\u2019t find any cobwebs.\n\nThe answer was always obvious. Carlos had the women cut their hair, because there was nothing else he could have done.  He needed for them to direct their energy into the group.\n\nOne day in class, after a few years of training, he looked out at his private class students and commented, \"What an energetic mass!\"\n\nHe told us it gave him access to things even don Juan couldn't reach.\n\nEdited: seven times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Hair", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_d2th8e", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1568242349.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1568221860.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s the deal with Hair?

If they're broken too much, they don't move on.\n\nOne day in private classes, Corey and Felix approached me.  Carlos had told them that he wanted to sell his compound on Pandora to us.  It was part of his preparation for being dead.\n\nWe were given almost a full tour of the place.  He showed us the wooden beam behind which Grant, naked at the time, was supposed to have vanished. It was a crack between worlds.\n\nAs I recall, he didn\u2019t bring us upstairs inside the main house.  If Corey would come to write for us, we could know for sure.\n\nBut if he didn't show us the upstairs, the reason for that became obvious later on.\n\nI was especially interested in his backyard, which was surrounded all around by fencing and thick plants.

I don\u2019t have good answers, but I think it\u2019s useful for me to tell what I know, because other men will find the same thing. They\u2019ll find energetically powerful women, and wonder if they aren\u2019t just chasing them for ordinary reasons.\n\nWell yes.  Of course!    That\u2019s the fun part. \n\nBut not really.  It\u2019s stalking.   Stalking is supposed to be fun.   \n\nAnd unfortunately, if you want to get a random woman around you, you sort of have to fit it into what they know.  Romance.  But there are multiple kinds of romance, including friendships based on attraction, which never cross the line.\n\nWomen love those!\n\nToss in some amusing chaos, and you\u2019ll get help from *intent*, who will sometimes take the chaos as a spin of the wheel of fortune, and give you the results as a prize.\n\nHow do you find energetically powerful women?  If you can *see*, it\u2019s easy.\n\nYou\u2019ll be somewhere ordinary, like in a bakery, look over to see how long the line is, notice a woman who catches your attention, and suddenly she\u2019ll glow.\n\nLiterally glow!\n\nBut if your *seeing* is erratic and not under your control, you can find them by being silent, and accidentally getting closer than a few feet to them.\n\nYou need the silence for obvious reasons.  Someone who isn\u2019t silent is lost in continuous fantasy.  You could shoot spitballs on their back again and again, and they might not notice.\n\nBut with silence, your assemblage point is barely holding on to the \u201creal world\u201d position.\n\nThen, if you get next to a woman with a lot of energy, it can move your assemblage point.   It happens even if she doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re nearby.  And even if you don\u2019t notice them at first.\n\nThere\u2019s rumors Carlos ran into such women a few times, and they weren\u2019t always brought into the group.  \n\nIt\u2019s very likely that if you find a super energetic woman, she\u2019ll be a \u201chot mess\u201d in her early 20s.  The \u201chot\u201d part is likely largely artificial, but who cares?   Hot is hot.\n\nAnd she\u2019ll probably be a disaster about to happen.  Energetic women often have a lot of self-caused trouble in their lives.\n\nI ran into a woman at Home Depot who glowed like the sun once I got 3 feet from her.  Her face literally turned into that picture from the cover of Separate Reality.  With clothes still visible, just like in that image! \n\nI mean, she didn\u2019t turn into a luminous cocoon the way Cholita does.  It was a composite, with clothes still on.\n\nIt was very strange.\n\nI stalked her, with help from the Chinese bosses\u2019 son who found it amusing, and brought her near me.  As the rule says, I engaged her in an enterprise where she could help.\n\nSince she was 35 years younger than me, I also found it amusing to bring her to family gatherings, thus adding some useful chaos to the mix.   Carlos himself had sent me back to my family, after I broke off all communications for 17 years.  I wanted to explore exactly what he had in mind,  by not hiding my doings from them.\n\nMy niece dubbed her, \u201cPrincess Bubblegum\u201d.  The implications of that are obvious if you\u2019ve seen \u201cAdventure Time\u201d cartoons.  The evil Ice King Sorcerer kidnaps Princess Bubblegum, who constantly dies in horrible accidents and has to be glued back together.\n\nIt was a perfect description of the situation. \n\nMuch of the major (conscious) progress I made in sorcery was tied to her energy, which might explain why a sorcery lineage tries to find the double woman first.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to learn sorcery on your own, and practice it alone. It\u2019s completely different when you\u2019re colliding with another person in the course of doing it.  It becomes a real thing, having an effect in the normal realm.\n\nThe energy she lent to me came in 2 forms. One was from trying to help solve her problems.  It completely disrupted my routine, which made it easier to move my assemblage point.  I had to take responsibility for what happened between us, because of the age difference. That required me to alter my normal internal dialogue.  And I had to engage in stalking, to be around her family and friends.\n\nAll ordinary stuff, but it\u2019s in the realm of continuous not-doing, and so it helps light up unused emanations, which releases usable energy.\n\nAnd if you believe she\u2019s giving you energy, and can even feel it, you\u2019ll work harder when practicing.\n\nThe other way she gave me energy was a direct loan.  That\u2019s the intriguing part.   When she was pleased with me, and even if I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d pleased her, she glowed orange. \n\nIt was like standing next to an old fashion bathroom heater, with those long elements that glow orange red.  The glow was both warm, and also had that feeling of bliss you get in heightened awareness.\n\nI was happy to hear Cholita say that Carlos had been looking for the \u201corange scout\u201d, because it\u2019s pretty obvious I\u2019d found one.\n\nNow she\u2019s married and living in Arizona with a child. If you are careful and don\u2019t get involved in sex, you can adopt a young woman for a few years, starting in her early 20s, and she\u2019ll naturally move on by herself.  \n\nIt\u2019s beneficial to both, as long as you don\u2019t worry about all the men she\u2019s chasing while she\u2019s around you.  High energy women attract endless men.\n\nHer friends confided in me a couple of times that they didn't want me to go away because they'd long feared she'd kill herself with her excessive partying, if I hadn't come along.\n\nBut once you\u2019re around them on a regular basis, the high energy balances out more.   It\u2019s not like you can get a dramatic surge of energy anytime they\u2019re around.\n\nIt\u2019s very much like having flashy experiences triggered by hard work and silence.  It\u2019s likely you won\u2019t be able to repeat them the next day.\n\nSame for energetic women.  You kind of have to please them, to get the energy.  \n\nI suspect it\u2019s one of the superpowers women have.  They don\u2019t entirely lure men with sex. They have energy men need also.  They\u2019re drug dealers of sorts.\n\nThe same thing happens in Ant colonies, where it turns out that the queen has a drug which keeps the worker ants happy.  \n \nBut as for high energy women wasting their energy, they can easily stir up their internal dialogues to crazy levels.  That\u2019s what uses up their energy.  \n\nYou can especially see that happen when they get into some kind of romantic situation that doesn't work out, feel bitter about it, and proceed to chase the man.  \n\n In the course of chasing him they get tired.   They notice the loss of their power, and start ranting on the web about how he was an \"energy vampire\".\n\nThere are whole web pages and blogs about men being energy vampires.\n\nReally, they're own internal dialogue is the energy vampire.  The guy just stirs it up.\n\nEdited: twice", "edited": 1568318862.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f01a9tn", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s an interesting topic.

And I had to engage in stalking, to be around her family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All ordinary stuff, but it\u2019s in the realm of continuous not-doing, and so it helps light up unused emanations, which releases usable energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you believe she\u2019s giving you energy, and can even feel it, you\u2019ll work harder when practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other way she gave me energy was a direct loan.  That\u2019s the intriguing part.   When she was pleased with me, and even if I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d pleased her, she glowed orange. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was like standing next to an old fashion bathroom heater, with those long elements that glow orange red.  The glow was both warm, and also had that feeling of bliss you get in heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was happy to hear Cholita say that Carlos had been looking for the \u201corange scout\u201d, because it\u2019s pretty obvious I\u2019d found one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now she\u2019s married and living in Arizona with a child. If you are careful and don\u2019t get involved in sex, you can adopt a young woman for a few years, starting in her early 20s, and she\u2019ll naturally move on by herself.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s beneficial to both, as long as you don\u2019t worry about all the men she\u2019s chasing while she\u2019s around you.  High energy women attract endless men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her friends confided in me a couple of times that they didn&amp;#39;t want me to go away because they&amp;#39;d long feared she&amp;#39;d kill herself with her excessive partying, if I hadn&amp;#39;t come along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you\u2019re around them on a regular basis, the high energy balances out more.   It\u2019s not like you can get a dramatic surge of energy anytime they\u2019re around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s very much like having flashy experiences triggered by hard work and silence.  It\u2019s likely you won\u2019t be able to repeat them the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for energetic women.  You kind of have to please them, to get the energy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect it\u2019s one of the superpowers women have.  They don\u2019t entirely lure men with sex. They have energy men need also.  They\u2019re drug dealers of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same thing happens in Ant colonies, where it turns out that the queen has a drug which keeps the worker ants happy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as for high energy women wasting their energy, they can easily stir up their internal dialogues to crazy levels.  That\u2019s what uses up their energy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can especially see that happen when they get into some kind of romantic situation that doesn&amp;#39;t work out, feel bitter about it, and proceed to chase the man.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the course of chasing him they get tired.   They notice the loss of their power, and start ranting on the web about how he was an &amp;quot;energy vampire&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are whole web pages and blogs about men being energy vampires.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, they&amp;#39;re own internal dialogue is the energy vampire.

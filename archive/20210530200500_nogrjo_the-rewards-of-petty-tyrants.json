Then you deal with them as a challenge, instead of a burden.\n\nFrankly, that won't work.\n\nThe way to deal with petty tyrants was taught to me by Cholita, who can be the most rotten petty tyrant imaginable, when she feels like it.\n\nShe thinks of the worst thing she can possibly say, and says it.\n\nIn a grocery store, she'll walk over to women and tell them, \"That man over there needs a wife. He's not very good looking,  but he has money and he likes women with big boobs like your own.\"\n\nThere's only one way to deal with Cholita.\n\nYou have to have no internal dialogue.\n\nThen, it's rather amusing.\n\nSo in this reddit, I'll let you in on a secret.\n\nOnce you can get silent, and if you have to deal with a petty tyrant, for whatever reason, if you do it well you get rewarded.\n\nIntent gifts you.\n\nI suppose \"intent gifts\" are for effort along the path.\n\nAnd it doesn't have to be just practicing. It can probably include any aspect of carrying the knowledge forward.\n\nCholita for example had her workshop entry fee and airplane travel paid for by Cleargreen, in exchange for running the bookstore.\n\nI'm sure just running the bookstore well, got her \"intent gifts\".\n\nZuleica suggested, a good way to learn sorcery is to take care of someone else.\n\nAs I do with Cholita.\n\nPlus, your IOB can read your thoughts and might take pity on you for hard work done, by showing you amazing magic to take your mind off the tyrants.  Sort of like giving you a cookie when you get home, because school was difficult today.\n\nNo school bullies, no cookie today?\n\nJust my opinion, but I suspect the \"Men of Knowledge\" were like that.\n\nNot all good guys.  In fact, mostly bad.\n\nThey needed the old seers, to get new magic.\n\nBut they were motivated by greed and ego. Not by a desire to learn sorcery.\n\nBecause they never learned to *see*.  The remnants of them are still left all over Mexico, but as don Juan said, they have no knowledge. They just repeat rituals.\n\nAnd outside the context of that time period, their magic is all gone.  And they're unable to bring it back.\n\nWhat's the cure?\n\nIt's easy!  Learn to *see*.\n\nIt isn't even difficult!\n\nWhen you find your first puff of color, you are *seeing*.\n\nHow long does that take?\n\nNo more than a few days if you are sincere!\n\nSincere = actually trying to remove the internal dialogue, and not pretending to be doing that.\n\nNow, is that ***really*** seeing?  A crummy puff of color?\n\nOr even a tiny blue dot that burns brightly and immediately vanishes?  Can that be *seeing*???\n\nActually, it's a pointless question.\n\nIf you want to fool people and embarrass them, such as when don Juan found \"the button nose boy\" using his seeing,  and you won't except lesser visions of the second attention,  such as a stupid purple puff, then I feel bad for you.\n\nYou're hooked to people, not magic.  You won't be able to learn. Just won't. Because you don't want to.\n\nAnd yes, that purple puff is seeing.\n\nBut the form of seeing most insist on, meaning astounding magic and telepathy, is  just the end of the J curve where the whitish light forms on surfaces.\n\nIf you can *see* a puff, you'll *see* that eventually.\n\nCarlos badly wanted us to learn to see, when it was obvious he was dying.\n\nHe tried everything, especially having us force silence right there in class.\n\nThat's like having a child do homework in class.\n\nYou have them do it, because you know they won't at home.\n\nCarlos finally resorted to that, for nearly 3 weeks.\n\nOne day he had us force silence, then he asked us to try to *see*.\n\nAlways a stickler for the rules, he was copying his own books.  Don Juan had done the same with Carlos. He simply invited him to give it a try one day.\n\nAs I recall, Carlos saw some apartment building with a man, or a poodle, hanging out the window.\n\nSomething bizarre.\n\nDon Juan informed him, yes that was seeing. When Carlos asked what it meant, don Juan pointed out, it wasn't up to him to explain what Carlos himself was seeing.\n\nThe same happened in private classes.  When Carlos asked us to try to see, I forced the best silence I could, with my eyes closed, and waited.\n\nUnknown to us, Carlos had *intended* our success.  Might even have borrowed some energy from Carol Tiggs.\n\nA little gnat flew up to my nose and hovered in front of my face.\n\nI was looking deep into a very dark grayish mist, which had obvious depth.\n\nIt's been a long time, and I don't remember precise details. Those are probably over in \"sustained action\" somewhere.\n\nBut I believe I said, \"hello\" to the gnat.\n\nI didn't expect it to answer!\n\nThe gnat said, \"Hello.  My name is Paul.\"\n\nWhen Carlos asked what we saw and I told him, both he and the entire class laughed.\n\nPaul is Felix Wolf.\n\nSometimes *seeing* can predict the future?  Because Felix did indeed become an annoying gnat, buzzing around Carlos and his students looking for something to suck up.\n\nHe goes around explaining how \"Carlos went bad\".\n\nIn that picture, the most notable thing is Lily's claim that stretching the luminous shell into a line only involves looking upward.\n\nI don't know if that's true, but there's a pass where you look downward and behind you, to move the assemblage point down.\n\nThe \"behind you\" part puts a little tension in the spine, and then you look the direction you want it to move.\n\nThe theory in Lily's technique seems to be, leaning back and looking up provides the tension, and then  you're also looking in relatively the right direction, to elongate the shell.\n\nIn fact, Lily tried to convince me that shapeshifting also altered the shape of the egg.\n\nShe claims it's \"stretchy\".\n\nHer technique to see clearly in the dark is kind of vague.  You look straight forward until your intense gaze brightens up a spot, and you can see the room in that \"spotlight\".\n\nExcept, what I saw wasn't my room.\n\nLily was right there, so I complained.\n\nI couldn't recall her exact words, but those in the picture weren't them.\n\nHer word's were more like, \"What do you want me to do about it?  It's your problem, not mine.\"\n\nThe hand waving trick is preparation for Lily's Catapult technique, which simulates what the Nagual Elias could do.\n\nI don't know if it's how he did it, but it produces the same effect.\n\nYou get to leave the dark room, fully awake, eyes open, and you zoom across the universe, until you land on a distant world.\n\nDoesn't even hurt when your feet hit the ground.\n\nIf you actually still have feet.\n\nBut in figuring out where to travel to, you have to look through the phantom copy of the room's wall.\n\nFancy showed me how to clear that out, so I had a clean view of space instead.\n\nBut the air was too thick, and that's as far as I could move my arm.

It&amp;#39;s your problem, not mine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hand waving trick is preparation for Lily&amp;#39;s Catapult technique, which simulates what the Nagual Elias could do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s how he did it, but it produces the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get to leave the dark room, fully awake, eyes open, and you zoom across the universe, until you land on a distant world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t even hurt when your feet hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you actually still have feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in figuring out where to travel to, you have to look through the phantom copy of the room&amp;#39;s wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy showed me how to clear that out, so I had a clean view of space instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the air was too thick, and that&amp;#39;s as far as I could move my arm.

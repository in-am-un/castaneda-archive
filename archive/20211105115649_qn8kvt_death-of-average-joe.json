I thought I was moving them all the way back, but I was just making little circles out to the side. I worked with Howard Lee. Howard was my Kung Fu teacher for 10 years. \\[From 1974 to 1984, according to Howard.\\] He was a great Kung Fu teacher. I went to him because I wanted more movement, I wanted to learn martial arts to get the more complete, full movement....\n\n...The martial arts connection with Tensegrity goes back to the Nagual Lujan, but after him, we had just the form of his movements without the rationale. It wasn't until Clara B\u00f6hm, with her martial arts training, formalizing the number of movements we should do, that the rationale was restored for the movements. Originally I was doing the movements in the way the sorcerers did them, which was shittily. They weren't good at movement, they were focusing on perception and changing perception, so movement wasn't really their fort? But I wanted both....\n\n...I showed Howard Lee where I'd dedicated to H.Y. Lee. Howard responded, 'You're Carlos Castaneda?' He'd read the books, and said, 'I got a lot of ideas, a lot of my stuff from those books.' It completely changed him. He was never the same toward me again. He used to be really comfortable and natural with me, and do acupuncture on me, but after that it was never the same. So I don't see him anymore. He's one of two people I would have liked to have helped.\"\n\nsource - \u00a0http://sustainedaction.org/Notes/cleargreen\\_night\\_sessionsVI.htm", "edited": 1636113217.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hjeiqb0", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Howard said that after death the attention slowly dissipated, lasting about 500 years before fizzling out.

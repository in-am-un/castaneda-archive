You just summon the *intent* of it.\n\nAnd you have to summon that with absolute certainty that it's there, with no ulterior motives, and with no fear.\n\nMost get stopped at the blue line, never actually making it down to the green.\n\nIf they do, most will decide they're magnificent, because they \"got it to work\", and go to make themselves a book so they can cash in.\n\nSome already got lame experiences from meditation and think that explains Castaneda, so they make the book before they actually learn to move to the green line.\n\nTheir books thus contaminate people who read them, keeping them up at the blue line on the J curve.\n\nI suppose false narratives stop 95% of people who believe they want to learn what's in the books of Carlos.\n\nAnd then another 3% are lost to greed.\n\nAnd 1% more to fear.\n\nIf you make it into the red zone, that's counted as a success.\n\nBut that's only 1 in 100 who claimed to be interested.  And most don't get past the doubt.\n\nThe doubt is the tonal trying to come up with a reason to quit.\n\nLet me go back and summarize the normal path people take.\n\nIt starts out with \"Who would believe this shit?\"\n\nOr with \"The Buddha gave us the correct path!\"\n\nOr \"But Jesus wouldn't like it!\"\n\nOr, \"Yogananda was more powerful than that!\"\n\nIf they remove those false narratives from their mind, they're usually stopped by laziness.\n\nEveryone claims they'll work hard, and even believe it.\n\nBut then, they never do.  Maybe once they do 1/4 of how much they should each practice session.\n\nAnd then come to post in the subreddit and lie about how hard they are working, and make up a problem to get some attention.  Their actual desired reward is attention.  Not magic.\n\nNot getting that in this subreddit (We're on to you!), they give up due to the amount of work it takes.\n\nWhich is NOT more than learning anything else.\n\nIt's the normal amount of work to learn something difficult.\n\nLike playing the trumpet well in a short time. Or ice skating.\n\nThe very small portion of people who come here and work hard enough to get to the green line, has the danger of greed causing them to take what they gained, and try to steal from the Castaneda community.\n\nI'll come back and explain the more interesting parts.\n\nWhat happens when you get to the bottom of the J curve, and try to move on.\n\n\\*\\*\\* I'm back \\*\\*\\*\n\nI suppose what I wanted to explain, which is the very interesting part once you come up the front and try to combat \"expectations\" and \"rationality\" won't really do anyone any good.\n\nIt's as don Juan said.  What happened to him, while learning, isn't of any benefit to anyone else as \"tips\".\n\nIt's just what happened to him.\n\nSo here's the Facebook \"daily nag\" version of this post.\n\nIf you think I harp on the Rambo headband too much, you need to look around more.\n\nPeople really wear that nonsense!\n\nI keep eyeing them and thinking, \"I suppose in the hot sun, if you were sweating, those would be useful.  And the 1980s style \"exercise headband\" looks less \"manly\".\n\nBut still,  a headband???  Who exactly is fooled by that?\n\nI spent a lot of time on Indian reservations as a child.\n\nI never saw a single Rambo headband.\n\nAnd I hung out with their shamans.\n\nMostly I saw hats with wide rims, to keep the sun off your face.\n\n\\*\\*\\* From Facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nWhat Does Clean The Link To Intent Mean?\n\nOne of the oddest things in the castaneda community is that no one seems to understand what it means to \"Clean the link to intent\".\n\nEven the people pretending to have sorcery knowledge, selling their fake sorcery books, don't know what it means.\n\nAnd yet, that's all sorcery is.\n\nThe rest is just how lineages taught their apprentices to clean that link.\n\nSome of what they did was said to be about \"Cleaning the Island of the Tonal\", so it wasn't loaded up with unnecessary stuff.\n\nBut thinking about it that way, just confuses beginners.\n\nWhich is fine if there's an entire lineage of 15 powerful sorcerers, helping them learn.\n\nWe don't even have one.\n\nAs a result, the whole \"warriors way\" thing has become a barrier to learning. People stop there at the level of \"Greed\" on that diagram.\n\nBut normally, when you have powerful sorcerers helping you and planning your learning, it makes sense to tell the apprentices about how they can help, by \"saving energy\". And the warrior's way is designed to do that.\n\nIt's just that if you don't practice any actual sorcery, saving energy will only make you waste it on something else.\n\nSo let's put all that aside and give you a very simple way to understand what it means to \"Clean the Link to Intent\".\n\nLet's start with the words of don Juan on this topic, but Carlos wrote about it elsewhere and we heard about it often in private classes.\n\nDon Juan explains it this way:\n\n\\*\\*\\* from the books \\*\\*\\*He said that in the universe there is an unmeasurable, indescribable force which sorcerers call intent, and that absolutely everything that exists in the entire cosmos is attached to intent by a connecting link. Sorcerers, or warriors, as he called them, were concerned with discussing, understanding, and employing that connecting link.\n\nThey were especially concerned with cleaning it of the numbing effects brought about by the ordinary concerns of their everyday lives. Sorcery at this level could be defined as the procedure of cleaning one's connecting link to intent. Don Juan stressed that this 'cleaning procedure' was extremely difficult to understand, or to learn to perform.\\*\\*\\* end of quote from the books \\*\\*\\*\n\nNow, I don't agree with don Juan that it's hard to understand.\n\nYou just need a \"tool\" to help you learn about it.\n\nHow about a \"magic mirror\" you can gaze into, and if your link to intent is \"clean\" you can remotely view anyone you like in that magic mirror?\n\nAnyone, anytime, anywhere!\n\nDo you believe that's going to far? For me to suggest such a think is possible?\n\nDid you read the books of Carlos Castaneda?\n\nHow about the mushroom shapes summoned by the moth dust. Carlos thought of a person, the dust caused a mushroom shape to appear, and then a skilled seer was able to interpret the shape, to learn anything he wanted about the person.\n\nDon Juan warned him, he didn't have the ability yet to interpret all the details. But he could \"feel\" the general state of the person.\n\nAs I recall, at one point he tries to summon Don Genaro, who literally leaped out of the moth dust vision, and landed right in front of Carlos. For real.\n\nWell... Not actually for real! It was his double.\n\nBut at the time Carlos wasn't aware he'd only been with the real Genaro twice.\n\nSo it seemed to be the real Genaro.\n\nBy the way, Cholita does that to me. So it's not a \"far fetched\" story.\n\nNow that I have you able to at least \"imagine\" a magic mirror that lets you see anyone, we have our \"tool\" to clean our link to intent.\n\nIf you request the mirror to summon someone, and it won't, you have a dirty link to intent.\n\nIf you succeed, you have a clean link to intent.\n\nTo \"clean your link to intent\" you nightly practice doing that. Using your \"magic mirror\" to display what you want it to display.\n\nThe first thing you learn is, you can't be fantasizing about the office. Your crummy boss.\n\nAnd you can't be trying to summon Bob, but all you can think about is Bob's super hot wife.\n\nThe mirror only responds to one request.\n\nWorse, the mirror has no ears.\n\nIt can't hear worth a damn!\n\nSo you can say, \"Bob!\"\n\nBut if you are thinking, \"Bob's hot wife in a miniskirt\", it won't work.\n\nYou have 2 requests going.\n\nIt has to be just one.\n\nWorse, since it has no ears the mirror uses a \"telepathic interface\".\n\nIt picks up ALL of your thoughts.\n\nAnd you have to convey the feeling you want to SEE Bob.\n\nNot that you wish he'd get in trouble with his wife, so you could try to hang out with her.\n\nHere is where I suppose you'll have a hard time believing the analogy, but trust me. It works this way.\n\nNext is the fact that you have to acquire a magic mirror in the first place.\n\nThey don't sell those at Walmart.\n\nSo you have to be involved in sorcery just to acquire a magic mirror, so you can put the finishing touches on your \"clean link to intent\".\n\nThe process of acquiring that magic mirror, is similar.\n\nYou have to rely on that magical force of intent to bring you one.\n\nAnd you can't be wanting something else, when you try to get intent to materialize a magic mirror for you.\n\nYou can't for instance be thinking that the Buddha was much cooler than any stupid magic mirror. And wiser than Carlos.\n\nThat's the intent to kiss up to the Buddha, not the intent to acquire a magic mirror.\n\nAnd you can't be thinking, if you could astral travel you wouldn't need the mirror.\n\nIt's yet another \"False Narrative\".\n\nFalse, because the Buddha was a delusional putz and didn't know anything worth trying to learn. He was a con man.\n\nAnd astral travel is a delusional lie used by attention and money seeking men, to fool others by misrepresenting their nightmares.\n\nYou're lured to the Buddha because of the lies he told about what he knew, and what he could teach.\n\nWhich should not happen anymore!\n\nJust look around! There's google now.\n\nI can only name 2 buddhists who have any magic at all, and it's rather pathetic compared to our darkroom students. They're only intermediate level, and yet they blow away all Buddhists I know of. Including the only 2 you can find on the internet, who seem to have any of that \"Buddha magic\".\n\nWhich is not much.\n\nIntermediate darkroom practitioners even blow away the famous Tibetan Yogi, \"Milarepa\".\n\nIn this case the barrier to cleaning your link to intent, is false narratives in your mind.\n\nCon artist stories used to excite your greed and lust for human attention, and get you to stick around and give them money.\n\nWhen in fact, they know nothing at all.\n\nKeep in mind, there is the \"Shamanic Drumming\" effect which will move your assemblage point down to the middle of your back, where fun stuff like \"bliss\" and \"visions\" happen.\n\nIt's not much. But it's as much as any other magical system can do.\n\nShamanic drumming removes any need for a con artist \"Buddha\" to sell you crappy old hinduism, repackaged for the oppressive Asian social order.\n\nRemember, we're trying to acquire a magic mirror here. And examining what creates an obstacle to that.\n\nSo how do you do it?\n\nCarlos put a picture on the cover of Wheel of Time! That Olmec in a loin cloth? That's a sorcerer, using his favorite Magic Mirror.\n\nThe Sky.\n\nCarlos told us how to turn the sky into a magic mirror! You have to remove that internal dialogue at least 2 minutes, so that the assemblage point can loosen from the top of your shoulder blades and drift down the back.\n\nWhen it goes under the bottom and up the front around 6 inches, it can move from the left side of the stomach, to the right side.\n\nIt's like that because \"Man's Band of Awareness\" is slightly tilted in our body.\n\nI've made pics of that.\n\nWhen it reaches the right side of the body, in the front, you get your magic mirror in the sky.\n\nOr in the palm of your hand!\n\nOr on flat surfaces.\n\nI prefer a dark room. It removes the distractions of the visible world. Zuleica preferred to teach like that too. At least, the men perhaps.\n\nSo to acquire a magic mirror you have to move the assemblage point to where the Nagual's blow puts it.\n\nIt has to be aligned with the other assemblage point we have, the one belonging to the energy body.\n\nAnd I suggest, just use a wall in your perfectly dark room as the magic mirror.\n\nWhen the assemblage point moves far enough, due to internal silence, you will see a \"whitish light\" on all surfaces.\n\nSit on the bed, and gaze at the wall.\n\nBingo! You are now face to face with your magic mirror.\n\nGood luck getting it to show what you want it to show!\n\nTHAT'S how you can clean your link to intent. Practice, practice, practice.\n\nWhat will you find is dirtying it?\n\nIt's in that picture.\n\nAnd when you dive off the end of the J curve into the land of Silent Knowledge, where infinity itself tells you stories designed to teach, you can go ahead and write your \"Toltec Sorcery Book\".\n\nBut you won't want to anymore. You'll realize that the desire to become famous and take money from others, based on teaching them something like sorcery, is the dirtiest link to intent of all.\n\nSo please. Put down that Rambo Headband with some feathers stuck in the top, get rid of that \"Genuine Shaman name\" you invented, and instead of having people call you, \"Lazy Crow\", just go back to being Fred.\n\nIf you actually have sorcery knowledge no one will care if you have an Indian sounding name.\n\nAnd that stupid rambo headband will only make you look like a fraud.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Cleaning the Link to Intent", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"oir3oz9f1i091": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oir3oz9f1i091.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c12579732c29eae4f4507e7c029fb20a59b22da6"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oir3oz9f1i091.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9cb5ee664fce2641a095142f9075c4782d2ee8a"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oir3oz9f1i091.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b86d5e477691d4caff9f965a5bdad0c99092a97b"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oir3oz9f1i091.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed7604e2887b5735f42d17573a2c5842c10b0a73"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oir3oz9f1i091.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3939092f0028ab31fb6598e62427699180323ee"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oir3oz9f1i091.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f3a5bf142bf7273521ce848891b4eb08fecdba7"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/oir3oz9f1i091.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adb6bc075f434b69d031cf5b54806858d27ad153"}, "id": "oir3oz9f1i091"}}, "name": "t3_ut9tq5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 36, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/74cZ8oYshj38ngulR3hvbhVdj60ueLPRRITfClMzdqc.jpg", "edited": 1652995059.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1652984928.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oir3oz9f1i091.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=adb6bc075f434b69d031cf5b54806858d27ad153\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/oir3oz9f1i091.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=adb6bc075f434b69d031cf5b54806858d27ad153&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is obvious for people who have studied in here, but for beginners it&amp;#39;ll need explaining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wrote about this in the other subreddit, but can&amp;#39;t use that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll come back and explain, but essentially you CANNOT learn sorcery.

Carlos thought of a person, the dust caused a mushroom shape to appear, and then a skilled seer was able to interpret the shape, to learn anything he wanted about the person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan warned him, he didn&amp;#39;t have the ability yet to interpret all the details. But he could &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; the general state of the person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I recall, at one point he tries to summon Don Genaro, who literally leaped out of the moth dust vision, and landed right in front of Carlos. For real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well... Not actually for real! It was his double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the time Carlos wasn&amp;#39;t aware he&amp;#39;d only been with the real Genaro twice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it seemed to be the real Genaro.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, Cholita does that to me. So it&amp;#39;s not a &amp;quot;far fetched&amp;quot; story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I have you able to at least &amp;quot;imagine&amp;quot; a magic mirror that lets you see anyone, we have our &amp;quot;tool&amp;quot; to clean our link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you request the mirror to summon someone, and it won&amp;#39;t, you have a dirty link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you succeed, you have a clean link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To &amp;quot;clean your link to intent&amp;quot; you nightly practice doing that. Using your &amp;quot;magic mirror&amp;quot; to display what you want it to display.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing you learn is, you can&amp;#39;t be fantasizing about the office. Your crummy boss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can&amp;#39;t be trying to summon Bob, but all you can think about is Bob&amp;#39;s super hot wife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mirror only responds to one request.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse, the mirror has no ears.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;#39;t hear worth a damn!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can say, &amp;quot;Bob!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you are thinking, &amp;quot;Bob&amp;#39;s hot wife in a miniskirt&amp;quot;, it won&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have 2 requests going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has to be just one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse, since it has no ears the mirror uses a &amp;quot;telepathic interface&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It picks up ALL of your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you have to convey the feeling you want to SEE Bob.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that you wish he&amp;#39;d get in trouble with his wife, so you could try to hang out with her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is where I suppose you&amp;#39;ll have a hard time believing the analogy, but trust me. It works this way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next is the fact that you have to acquire a magic mirror in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t sell those at Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you have to be involved in sorcery just to acquire a magic mirror, so you can put the finishing touches on your &amp;quot;clean link to intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The process of acquiring that magic mirror, is similar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to rely on that magical force of intent to bring you one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can&amp;#39;t be wanting something else, when you try to get intent to materialize a magic mirror for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t for instance be thinking that the Buddha was much cooler than any stupid magic mirror. And wiser than Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the intent to kiss up to the Buddha, not the intent to acquire a magic mirror.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can&amp;#39;t be thinking, if you could astral travel you wouldn&amp;#39;t need the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s yet another &amp;quot;False Narrative&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;False, because the Buddha was a delusional putz and didn&amp;#39;t know anything worth trying to learn. He was a con man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And astral travel is a delusional lie used by attention and money seeking men, to fool others by misrepresenting their nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re lured to the Buddha because of the lies he told about what he knew, and what he could teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which should not happen anymore!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just look around! There&amp;#39;s google now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can only name 2 buddhists who have any magic at all, and it&amp;#39;s rather pathetic compared to our darkroom students. They&amp;#39;re only intermediate level, and yet they blow away all Buddhists I know of. Including the only 2 you can find on the internet, who seem to have any of that &amp;quot;Buddha magic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is not much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intermediate darkroom practitioners even blow away the famous Tibetan Yogi, &amp;quot;Milarepa&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case the barrier to cleaning your link to intent, is false narratives in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Con artist stories used to excite your greed and lust for human attention, and get you to stick around and give them money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in fact, they know nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, there is the &amp;quot;Shamanic Drumming&amp;quot; effect which will move your assemblage point down to the middle of your back, where fun stuff like &amp;quot;bliss&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;visions&amp;quot; happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not much. But it&amp;#39;s as much as any other magical system can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shamanic drumming removes any need for a con artist &amp;quot;Buddha&amp;quot; to sell you crappy old hinduism, repackaged for the oppressive Asian social order.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, we&amp;#39;re trying to acquire a magic mirror here. And examining what creates an obstacle to that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how do you do it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos put a picture on the cover of Wheel of Time! That Olmec in a loin cloth? That&amp;#39;s a sorcerer, using his favorite Magic Mirror.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos told us how to turn the sky into a magic mirror! You have to remove that internal dialogue at least 2 minutes, so that the assemblage point can loosen from the top of your shoulder blades and drift down the back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it goes under the bottom and up the front around 6 inches, it can move from the left side of the stomach, to the right side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like that because &amp;quot;Man&amp;#39;s Band of Awareness&amp;quot; is slightly tilted in our body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve made pics of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it reaches the right side of the body, in the front, you get your magic mirror in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or in the palm of your hand!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or on flat surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I prefer a dark room. It removes the distractions of the visible world. Zuleica preferred to teach like that too. At least, the men perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to acquire a magic mirror you have to move the assemblage point to where the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow puts it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has to be aligned with the other assemblage point we have, the one belonging to the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I suggest, just use a wall in your perfectly dark room as the magic mirror.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the assemblage point moves far enough, due to internal silence, you will see a &amp;quot;whitish light&amp;quot; on all surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sit on the bed, and gaze at the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bingo! You are now face to face with your magic mirror.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck getting it to show what you want it to show!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THAT&amp;#39;S how you can clean your link to intent. Practice, practice, practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What will you find is dirtying it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s in that picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you dive off the end of the J curve into the land of Silent Knowledge, where infinity itself tells you stories designed to teach, you can go ahead and write your &amp;quot;Toltec Sorcery Book&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you won&amp;#39;t want to anymore. You&amp;#39;ll realize that the desire to become famous and take money from others, based on teaching them something like sorcery, is the dirtiest link to intent of all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So please. Put down that Rambo Headband with some feathers stuck in the top, get rid of that &amp;quot;Genuine Shaman name&amp;quot; you invented, and instead of having people call you, &amp;quot;Lazy Crow&amp;quot;, just go back to being Fred.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you actually have sorcery knowledge no one will care if you have an Indian sounding name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that stupid rambo headband will only make you look like a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null,

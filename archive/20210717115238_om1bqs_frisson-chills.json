I inhale and slightly increase some kind of tension in my body that\u2019s hard to describe and then as I exhale I get frisson, mostly on my back but it can go right up to my head and down my limbs if it\u2019s really strong. The only difference with what you describe is when I create the tension, I focus on my lower spine instead of the back of my neck. How interesting. I noticed I could do this quite a while ago just in general so I often do it for fun cause it feels nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you \u2018charge\u2019 it up as well? If I do it over and over it can get really powerful and it extends how far the frisson reaches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The frisson that I\u2019m getting in darkroom is a little different though. It\u2019s not connected to my breathing but to movement. The breathing frisson feels coarser in comparison. The movement frisson is finer and runs across different parts of my body on its own. It also feels really nice but there\u2019s something strange about it without it being tied to breath.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_om1bqs", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/om1bqs/frisson_chills/h5kdqgu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1626562636.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h5j1uiz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "KrazyTayl", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1626538642.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_om1bqs", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_3i08j", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Same for me except it starts linking to my breathing where I inhale slowly, then hold and kind slightly increase internal bodily tension with a bit of awareness on the back of my neck and then when I exhale I get frisson.

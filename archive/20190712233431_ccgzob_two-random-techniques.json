I don\u2019t believe they work as well, but that\u2019s splitting hairs.\n\n**First technique:** Walk on flat asphalt pavement somewhere that it\u2019s very consistent (even colored).  Gently close your eyes a bit until you can see your eyelashes.  Now find any dust on your eyes, cataracts, or unexplained defects, such as a spot in the middle that isn\u2019t as light sensitive.\n\nWalk along looking downward so that the dust is projected a few feet in front of you as you walk.   Try to raise your eyelashes so you\u2019re only looking at that stuff.  But not because it\u2019s any better, it just seems more relaxing.\n\nJust keep watching the dust.   I say don\u2019t watch the eyelashes if you can, because some very sharp lines might eventually appear.  If you aren\u2019t making your eyelashes show up, you\u2019ll know those lines are not eyelashes, and so they might (must?) be from the second attention.\n\nI have no idea what those really are.  But you\u2019re also likely to start to see yellow colored spots. That\u2019s when the fun starts.\n\nAll of this stuff will seem pointless while you\u2019re doing it.   But ignore that and keep it up. Did I forget to mention you have to FORCE yourself silent?  That\u2019s always a given.\n\nWARNING!!!!  This technique is dangerous since you're walking around squinting and looking only at stuff that isn't there.  You'll trip on speed bumps,  walk into a car parked where it shouldn't be,  and generally get into the kind of trouble a drunkard would, in a parking lot.  Find a safe place and remember to pay attention slightly more than you'd like.\n\nCarlos once made fun of someone at UCLA who walked into a tree, while practicing some meditation technique.  So don't be that guy. This is a dreaming technique, done walking around.  Take precautions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Second technique:**  Sit on the couch, find a houseplant to gaze at (plastic is fine), and keep gazing until either the plant looks strange, or you fall asleep, have a little dream, wake up, and curse yourself for failing.\n\nYou didn\u2019t fail. You moved your assemblage point.  And gazing at weirdness is already gazing at the second attention. If you look at the second attention while silent, your assemblage point is guaranteed to shift.\n\nBut you have to be silent, obviously.\n\nNow why didn't you notice this before, since many of you have practiced gazing?\n\nNo one told you, that's why.  You got the effect, but didn't keep it up long enough, or with enough silence, to move the assemblage point enough to be noticable. Or if you did move it enough to be noticable, you might have dismissed it as a fast dream.\n\nMost people who take my advice will eventually realize, they were doing the right thing a long time ago, but no one told them so.\n\nIf you do this plant gazing / sleeping and dreaming technique,  you\u2019ll merge the second attention with the first, but more as a form of switching between the two. They won\u2019t be as integrated as with Zuleica\u2019s technique. But it\u2019ll be a good start.\n\nThese techniques are from people who write to me, and they work.  They couldn\u2019t find the circumstances to use Zuleica\u2019s technique, so they did what they could.\n\nI\u2019ve also got a solar eclipse goggle user who\u2019s having some success with seeing colors.\n\nRule #1 of sorcery:  It works as long as you actually try.  If you don\u2019t try, it won\u2019t work. It also doesn't work, even if you don\u2019t try while in Carlos\u2019 private classes.  Being around someone else, hoping to absorb it, is not going to work out.\n\nI\u2019m puzzled to see people going to me-too phony nagual Facebook pages, and conversing with them.  I have no idea what they think they\u2019ll get from that.\n\nSo I diverted a couple to see what was going on with them.\n\nNothing, that\u2019s what they get from it.  An all-day tweeting Nagual is still a fake Nagual.\n\nI also found out the obvious.  If you ask a me-too Nagual a question and they ignore or can't answer it, that's a fake nagual.  A real sorcerer would find a way to answer it and make it seem natural and common sense.\n\nIf it's mysterious and book quotey, that's a fake.\n\nHowever, the fakes have their purposes. People are hard to deal with.  If they want to do that, then at least let's hope they practice themselves, on the side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited to add parking lot warning", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Two Random Techniques", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Misc.

As others have alluded to, it would be nice if you to elaborate somewhat, so others understand better where you are coming from and the context. That said, what's really interesting to me are several things you mention in common with Castaneda's practices. \n\n1. Separating yourself from your familiar circumstances for a sustained period of time. Don Juan obviously mentions this several times to all the apprentices. That is known to have a beneficial effect for inner-silence/sorcery because it frees up time and energy literally and energetically.\n\n2. Circular gazing. Circular gazing is a very effective inner silence practice, in dark room and elsewhere. The cool drawing is not as critical, I don't think, but the use of circular gazing until you perceive some sight of the second attention, is a desired result and an hour or more seems appropriate. This is highly reminiscent of an exercise Taisha is taught, that involves \"drawing a pleasing shape\" where the example is a circle and to trace it with the eyes. Then trace the circle by rolling the eyes, then \"jump with the eyes into the center\". Sounds effectively identical to what you are describing.\n\n3. Memorizing something visually well enough to be able to see it when it is not in front of you, is also reminiscent of a technique taught to Taisha Abelar, but she did that with candle flame gazing. It was presented to her as a way to focus the mind and balance oneself.\n\n4. Finding one's direction. This is a fairly important topic in the books though it was never clear to me how you'd know that without a sorcerer that can see. This seems like possibly a working ritual for that? I don't know what to make of it at the moment, but it's interesting.\n\nNonetheless, I think in your circumstances, it would be ideal for you to add dark room practice, or dreaming-awake, to what you already do. It's such a great tool. You just get total darkness, sleep masks work fine, keep your eyes open and sober and just get silent inside.

Who are openly sharing tips on how to learn faster, for real.\n\nOtherwise, if there's no actual students to observe, and someone thinks what you say sounds possible, disregarding it's only your word,  I'd still advise to pretend to be Jesus.\n\nYou get cooler super powers.", "edited": 1653518083.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i9zsnwx", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well this one is unique!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Haven&amp;#39;t really run into this situation before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to become an expert on what sort of magic is out there, whether it&amp;#39;s true, and why people cling to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re trying to get more to practice our own form, which is the only real form I&amp;#39;m aware of.

It&amp;#39;s posted in here if you care to study this history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Olmecs gave rise to virtually all mesoamerican shamanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the results of their doings from long ago are right there to see all over Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the beings themselves, the old seers, are also available for us to meet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They come to visit for real!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know what it leads to in its pure form, because we&amp;#39;re doing it in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s vastly more interesting than where your technique leads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also,  your claims of no food or a glowing face sound kind of like Hindu or Daoist pretend magic stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like you&amp;#39;re actually doing something you read about, but not being  upfront with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fact is, it&amp;#39;s of no use in here.  Not even particularly impressive  if it were true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t suppose you&amp;#39;ll be able to sell it anywhere else though, because they&amp;#39;ll simply dismiss it as made up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t quite do that, because we do things that weird daily for hours.  And no one believes us either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;smell right&amp;quot; to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you suck off a few people to go try to learn what you&amp;#39;re doing.   Somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t need people who lack sobriety in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they come back excited, maybe it&amp;#39;ll be worth a second examination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were to simply believe you, and there seemed to be some value to it (there doesn&amp;#39;t), then why shouldn&amp;#39;t I follow Jesus instead?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His followers claim he did magic too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And his sounds like more fun.   Command of 10,000 angels!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or I suppose I could believe Yogananda.  I&amp;#39;d love to be able to do all the stuff in his books!  His people &amp;quot;glow&amp;quot; too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, he never taught a single person to do any of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just sucked up cash and women, died, and left his palace in Los Angeles to one of his lovers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you taught anyone this, and where are they?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good rule for you to learn, even if you really can do what you say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never listen to a single man making magical claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Insist on seeing excited students.  Who are openly sharing tips on how to learn faster, for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, if there&amp;#39;s no actual students to observe, and someone thinks what you say sounds possible, disregarding it&amp;#39;s only your word,  I&amp;#39;d still advise to pretend to be Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get cooler super powers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/uxrp9e/deleted_by_user/i9zsnwx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1653517723.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_uxrp9e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_uxrp9e", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ia0ma4t", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "AutoModerator", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1653531541.0, "send_replies": false, "parent_id": "t1_ia0ma2y", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Your comment has been automatically removed because your account does not meet our account-age requirement of 10 days.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

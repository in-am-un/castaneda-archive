I have too much work to do.\n\nI got my animation computer assembled today, ran it on a bench mark web page, and it actually beat the high score on that site, used by at least hundreds of thousands of people a year.\n\nI don't understand the ratings, but it was 1300 times faster than the computer I'm using now. Which was a very good computer 5 years ago.\n\nIt's the computer chip detail size I suppose.  They're down to sub 2uM these days.  Smaller means faster (and cheaper too).  I don't know what the i9 has, but it's surely smaller than my last computer.\n\nIt also has the world's best video card, which has 6 fans of it's own.  And can only fit in a gigantic computer case.\n\nThe computer nearly weighs as much as Cholita.\n\nOr at least, Cholita couldn't carry it around much.\n\nI also finally purchased a Mocap suit.  Like the one those live bloggers wear, which lets them use whole body animations in place of themselves on live internet broadcasts.\n\nSo I can start making animations of tensegrity moves very soon.\n\nWhile I was doing my magical passes tonight, I got to watch a cartoon. From infinity.\n\nYes, I know...\n\nYou shouldn't be watching streaming media on a monitor in the room where you are doing your tensegrity.\n\nYou certainly wouldn't want to be watching CNN or Fox News.\n\nYou're supposed to be silent!\n\nAnd that's precisely why running man works so incredibly well.\n\nPrecisely why Carlos introduced it at the end, as his \"last hope\".  Before he died.\n\nBut he failed.  Sitting alone with me on the steps of Dance home, he admitted \"I'm dying, and no one believes me.\"\n\nI understand that now.  Carlos knew I \"followed orders\".  So he tried a \"hail mary\" pass with me.\n\nJust the kind of thing intent likes.\n\nSo his last hope to turn things around failed.\n\nAnd why that's so,  will be obvious by the end of this post.\n\nBy the way...\n\nHe had an all female class doing that running man series.   Called it \"not-doings\" and it included the wrestler pass, from that Olmec figurine.\n\nHe was also rather ruthless about how well they did it too.  A real slave driver by then.\n\nAsk Jadey.\n\nAnd they were...\n\nWait for it.  Wait for  it!!!\n\nNaked.\n\nEven 10 year old Carola was in there, naked.\n\nDarned witches!\n\nI would have said, \"Are you CRAZY Carlos???  Even if I were willing to get naked in Tensegrity class, which I'm certainly not so don't get any ideas, how do you think that will go over when some loud mouth tells the whole world about it???\n\nOops.. .  I just did.\n\nOh well.  I'd better explain.\n\nYour \"double\",  your better half, isn't entirely unconcerned for the organic body half of yourself.\n\nIt \"checks in\" if there's a reason.\n\nSome people, perhaps 1 in 500, have a double who constantly checks in.  You can see it standing right next to the person.\n\nOddly, Carlos made a point of pointing out which side it stands on.  I didn't think that detail was important at the time, and maybe it's not, but he had it standing on the right side.\n\nThe right side energy is the physical side.\n\nThe left is all \"heavenly\".  But also \"insect\".\n\nThe right is the direction of the beast.  For shapeshifting into Werewolves or Werejaguars.\n\nI suppose even Weresquirrels.  I did a toad once.\n\nOne of these days I'll figure out how to become a squirrel so I can play a trick on Cholita's demon friend, \"Minx\".\n\nWho likes to appear as a squirrel. I'll need to giant pile of nuts, to tease him with.\n\nHe can't actually eat food.\n\nMinx is around even during the day, wherever Cholita goes.\n\nI'll be in the car with Cholita, parked in the shade.\n\nAnd high above us, is a squirrel.\n\nDoing high wire tricks on an electrical line stretching across the street.\n\nThe last time I said, \"Cholita! Look up there!! Please, please, look up there!!!!\"\n\nBut she didn't.\n\nShe just kept swiping pictures of dead people on her iPhone.\n\nSo that I'd get the hint I suppose.\n\nBy the way, I came home today hoping to show off my new jeans to Cholita.\n\nShe'd attacked me two days before, criticizing everything I was wearing.\n\nIncluding my new jeans.  She said they were the wrong color.\n\nI asked her what color would be appropriate, and she thought about it a while.\n\nShe looked me up and down and said,  \"Diarrhea Green\".\n\nSo I got some!\n\n1 day delivery from Amazon!\n\nThus I came home in my green jeans, with New Balance shoes because Carlos wore those and Cholita said mine looked like they came from Walmart.\n\nWell...  They did.\n\nI thought I'd surprise her.\n\nI was happy to see she was ok.  We had rain so heavy today that it flooded my business all the way to the sidewalk next to the door.\n\nAnd Cholita had announced she needed to go to Los Angeles.  Where she tends to go, at least a 1 hour drive.\n\nShe freaks out when it rains too hard.  And does very odd stuff.\n\nBut she was ok!\n\nI smelled something funny when I got into the house.  I couldn't figure out if maybe it was marijuana, or some weird incense.  Cholita's a big fan of incense.  Not so much of marijuana.\n\nI walked over to her which is risky to my health, and pointed out that I had followed her instructions and had the green jeans and NB tennis shoes.\n\nCholita turned around, and she was smoking a big cigar!  Like a witch from Florinda's book.\n\nI realized it had to be a fairly expensive one.  It smelled wonderful.\n\nShe mumbled something about where it came from, but it was impossible to decipher.\n\nShe explained that she was moving back to Mexico so now I could get a life and not lock myself up in my pitch black room for so long.\n\nActually I'm in there to avoid death by Cholita.   But I'm lucky enough to be able to travel anywhere in the universe (not on demand), and I even get constant visitors.\n\nBut try telling that to Cholita.\n\nI pointed out that if she'd just accept social security insurance money (she can't keep a job), she could live like a queen in Mexico.\n\nShe said, \"Stop self serving!!!\" and waved her hand to dismiss me.\n\nThat was all I needed.  Dosed with dark energy by Cholita.  And she had a nicotine high too!\n\nIt had an amazing effect.\n\nOne was that I got to watch a cartoon of the \"Running Man\" series.\n\nIt was so obvious, I couldn't believe I didn't realize it.  It even explained \"naked tensegrity\".\n\nSo, some people have a double which visits them regularly.  Which makes those people useful to sorcerers who are trying to teach the public.\n\nYou can literally talk to their double, while their tonal person is oblivious to that going on.\n\nI found a double being perhaps 10 years ago, and could do the same with her on rare occasions.\n\nTo perceive the double you just need to be in the red zone.\n\nAnd the other person's double has to be visiting your copy of reality.\n\nThat's the catch.  It's that old \"fourth gate of dreaming\".  You have to wake up in the real copy of your bedroom.  Unfortunately, there's 20,000.\n\nSame for shared waking dreaming with someone's double.\n\nI highly recommend the man be awake.  Because men are lying attention seekers who will make up anything to take over the Chimp tribe.  We evolved to be that way.\n\nSo men, stay awake.  Do shared dreaming with a witch. Who can be \"asleep\" if they like.\n\nBut not very many people have a double who is \"right there\" often enough to catch it.\n\nSo how to lure the double to come around?\n\nThreaten the person's tonal.\n\nBeing naked will do it.\n\nWorrying about a naked 10 year old child on the matt next to you will help even more.\n\nIf Dance Home were burning down at the same time, that would be a plus!\n\nBeing tossed into a raging river to die the way Julian did to don Juan, will also do it.\n\nI suppose Carlos could have taken a class of women to the river, and tossed them in.\n\nBut that took days to bring out don Juan's double far enough to go visit Julian.\n\nAnd don Juan didn't really enjoy the drowning part.\n\nAnyway, I got to see a cartoon of running man while the dreaming emissary explained why it works so well.\n\nAnd after the missing passes are animated, I'll animate that one.\n\nAnd show in great detail why it works.\n\nIt retrains your muscle memory to produce silence during leg movements.\n\nCarlos did as many leg muscle movements as you could think up, laying on your back.\n\nIt seems to deliberately twist and turn all muscles pertaining to the legs.\n\nWhen done in darkness the results become visible!  It's a dazzling view of pink light flowing around.\n\nYour Ally will even get involved.  You can play \"ping pong\" with the head of a spirit, like the one superr made for us last week.\n\nBut more than anything else, if you learn to \"see energy\" while doing it so that the display of amazing pink flurries is vivid, and knowing that if you do it very silently you start to see a little stream of running water in which your feet are splashing, you are \"sufficiently rewarded\" to keep that up.\n\nWhich REQUIRES silence, to get the reward.\n\nSo you do all possible leg movements in silence.\n\nKeep in mind, our muscle memory is what controls our body.\n\nYou can't possibly walk under the control of your lousy internal dialogue.\n\nIt's like a 4.7MHz PC back in 1985, compared to my new 32 core 3.5GHz Pentium i9.  God only knows how many times faster this computer is, relative to an \"IBM PC\" back then.\n\nSo your internal dialogue DOES NOT make you walk.\n\nAll it does is say, \"Jeeves, let's walk\".\n\nAll it CAN do, for moving muscles, is \"Ask Jeeves\".\n\nWhich was perhaps the first attempt at a ChatGPT AI, way back when.  Late 80s?\n\nPoor Jeeves didn't survive. But there's a small chance Jeeves still lives in Japan. Once they get used to something it becomes \"the best way to do that\". Westerners get confused, and assume  it really is the best way to do things.\n\nNo, it's just Japan.  Their karate \"masters\" get their butts kicked fast, in MMA fighting.\n\nRunning man retrains your muscle memory to \"walk in silence\".\n\nIt TRAINS silence, into the muscle movements.\n\nBut even better!\n\nYour muscle memory can move your assemblage point.\n\nThat's what I saw in the cartoon that was so astonishing.\n\nI couldn't believe I hadn't realized it!\n\nOf course it can.\n\nCase in point.  A woman with a raging internal dialogue fussing about her horrible life, has her baby with her while driving.\n\nNow don't make me think up how, but the baby ends up under the car in the baby carriage, and for some reason the car is about to explode into flames.\n\nThat part of the cartoon is fuzzy now.\n\nBut just say that happened.\n\nAnd instantly muscle memory takes over, shifts the woman's assemblage point down to the green line or even the red, and FAR to the right, and she has superhuman strength.\n\nHey, that works!  I once lifted Cholita's little Fiat with one hand while I was shapeshifted.\n\nSo the woman pulls up the car all by herself with one arm, and reaches under to pull the baby out.\n\nThat's why the muscle memory also has some control over the position of the assemblage point.\n\nAnd why naked running man series came to be. To lure their doubles as a last ditch effort to alter the energetic mass of his private classes.\n\nIt was the last chance Carlos had.\n\nAnd it's also why running man series will be one of the first \"complete\" cartoons I make.\n\nIt really shows why tensegrity works.\n\nI suppose I don't have to make a picture for this one.\n\nI'll just ask Jeeves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The AMAZING Running Man Series of Magical Passes", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 93, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"kmb86gsr72oa1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 72, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kmb86gsr72oa1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c6386d3014304bbef5559bf7b6444f3234e3a6f"}, {"y": 144, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kmb86gsr72oa1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b96f88560d22aa29c5336f7f12cb027486aa126f"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kmb86gsr72oa1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c211fb1787a50a73b0f8c511e84ae206eab03bfa"}, {"y": 426, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kmb86gsr72oa1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa28cfe5deadd751fb49ce201a247a6be7ec1f88"}, {"y": 640, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kmb86gsr72oa1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43ce8a5264b1c57009db344a526c5038554b5de4"}, {"y": 720, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kmb86gsr72oa1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90d756dffdb281ddcf15a93c3e7d848110982b3b"}], "s": {"y": 1280, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/kmb86gsr72oa1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8c6eca9967d4e2c82f8a8dab8768295b6bea31e"}, "id": "kmb86gsr72oa1"}}, "name": "t3_11snws9", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ddJyMJAK3oe6K8_6zBLLbhqgP_QRXQkJq-zLmg-nkDI.jpg", "edited": 1678985024.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1678954404.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kmb86gsr72oa1.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c8c6eca9967d4e2c82f8a8dab8768295b6bea31e\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/kmb86gsr72oa1.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c8c6eca9967d4e2c82f8a8dab8768295b6bea31e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really can&amp;#39;t afford to make a picture for this one.

And she had a nicotine high too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had an amazing effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One was that I got to watch a cartoon of the &amp;quot;Running Man&amp;quot; series.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was so obvious, I couldn&amp;#39;t believe I didn&amp;#39;t realize it.  It even explained &amp;quot;naked tensegrity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, some people have a double which visits them regularly.  Which makes those people useful to sorcerers who are trying to teach the public.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can literally talk to their double, while their tonal person is oblivious to that going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found a double being perhaps 10 years ago, and could do the same with her on rare occasions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To perceive the double you just need to be in the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the other person&amp;#39;s double has to be visiting your copy of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the catch.  It&amp;#39;s that old &amp;quot;fourth gate of dreaming&amp;quot;.  You have to wake up in the real copy of your bedroom.  Unfortunately, there&amp;#39;s 20,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for shared waking dreaming with someone&amp;#39;s double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend the man be awake.  Because men are lying attention seekers who will make up anything to take over the Chimp tribe.  We evolved to be that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So men, stay awake.  Do shared dreaming with a witch. Who can be &amp;quot;asleep&amp;quot; if they like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not very many people have a double who is &amp;quot;right there&amp;quot; often enough to catch it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how to lure the double to come around?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Threaten the person&amp;#39;s tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being naked will do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worrying about a naked 10 year old child on the matt next to you will help even more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Dance Home were burning down at the same time, that would be a plus!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being tossed into a raging river to die the way Julian did to don Juan, will also do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose Carlos could have taken a class of women to the river, and tossed them in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that took days to bring out don Juan&amp;#39;s double far enough to go visit Julian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don Juan didn&amp;#39;t really enjoy the drowning part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I got to see a cartoon of running man while the dreaming emissary explained why it works so well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And after the missing passes are animated, I&amp;#39;ll animate that one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And show in great detail why it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It retrains your muscle memory to produce silence during leg movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos did as many leg muscle movements as you could think up, laying on your back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems to deliberately twist and turn all muscles pertaining to the legs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When done in darkness the results become visible!  It&amp;#39;s a dazzling view of pink light flowing around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your Ally will even get involved.  You can play &amp;quot;ping pong&amp;quot; with the head of a spirit, like the one superr made for us last week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But more than anything else, if you learn to &amp;quot;see energy&amp;quot; while doing it so that the display of amazing pink flurries is vivid, and knowing that if you do it very silently you start to see a little stream of running water in which your feet are splashing, you are &amp;quot;sufficiently rewarded&amp;quot; to keep that up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which REQUIRES silence, to get the reward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you do all possible leg movements in silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, our muscle memory is what controls our body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t possibly walk under the control of your lousy internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like a 4.7MHz PC back in 1985, compared to my new 32 core 3.5GHz Pentium i9.  God only knows how many times faster this computer is, relative to an &amp;quot;IBM PC&amp;quot; back then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So your internal dialogue DOES NOT make you walk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All it does is say, &amp;quot;Jeeves, let&amp;#39;s walk&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All it CAN do, for moving muscles, is &amp;quot;Ask Jeeves&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was perhaps the first attempt at a ChatGPT AI, way back when.  Late 80s?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Poor Jeeves didn&amp;#39;t survive. But there&amp;#39;s a small chance Jeeves still lives in Japan. Once they get used to something it becomes &amp;quot;the best way to do that&amp;quot;. Westerners get confused, and assume  it really is the best way to do things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, it&amp;#39;s just Japan.  Their karate &amp;quot;masters&amp;quot; get their butts kicked fast, in MMA fighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Running man retrains your muscle memory to &amp;quot;walk in silence&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It TRAINS silence, into the muscle movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even better!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your muscle memory can move your assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what I saw in the cartoon that was so astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t believe I hadn&amp;#39;t realized it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course it can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Case in point.  A woman with a raging internal dialogue fussing about her horrible life, has her baby with her while driving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now don&amp;#39;t make me think up how, but the baby ends up under the car in the baby carriage, and for some reason the car is about to explode into flames.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That part of the cartoon is fuzzy now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But just say that happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And instantly muscle memory takes over, shifts the woman&amp;#39;s assemblage point down to the green line or even the red, and FAR to the right, and she has superhuman strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, that works!  I once lifted Cholita&amp;#39;s little Fiat with one hand while I was shapeshifted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the woman pulls up the car all by herself with one arm, and reaches under to pull the baby out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why the muscle memory also has some control over the position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And why naked running man series came to be. To lure their doubles as a last ditch effort to alter the energetic mass of his private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the last chance Carlos had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s also why running man series will be one of the first &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; cartoons I make.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really shows why tensegrity works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose I don&amp;#39;t have to make a picture for this one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll just ask Jeeves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "c812fe20-6005-11ea-a726-0e9c39b3b989", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "11snws9", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 24, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11snws9/the_amazing_running_man_series_of_magical_passes/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/11snws9/the_amazing_running_man_series_of_magical_passes/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1678954404.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jces5j0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1678958501.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcep6dz", "score": 12, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I'm glad you mentioned that.\n\nWe had some bad player women in private classes, who claimed Carlos created those because he was too sick to stand and do tensegrity with everyone.\n\nMaybe...\n\nBut why is that a criticism?\n\nIt just caused him to make some of the most simple and useful passes of all time.\n\nEveryone wants a saint.\n\nIt's sad.\n\nThe people out there stealing from our community, now exposed for the frauds they are, commonly attempt to point out that I'm not saintly enough to lead.\n\nWhat????\n\nThey're obsessed with \"who gets to lead\" more than how to actually get some  magic.\n\nTruth be told, Cholita is actually the one in charge.\n\nAnd she's as far from saintly as you can possibly get.\n\nShe'd be burned alive by the Christian \"saints\".\n\nSmoking a big cigar.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jces5j0", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad you mentioned that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had some bad player women in private classes, who claimed Carlos created those because he was too sick to stand and do tensegrity with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But why is that a criticism?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just caused him to make some of the most simple and useful passes of all time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants a saint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s sad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people out there stealing from our community, now exposed for the frauds they are, commonly attempt to point out that I&amp;#39;m not saintly enough to lead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What????&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re obsessed with &amp;quot;who gets to lead&amp;quot;

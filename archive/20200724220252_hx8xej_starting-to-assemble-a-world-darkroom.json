I didn't get very far with this, but I could see details, like a photo.\n\nAlso, while I was seeing this village a man appeared above it; I could see his torso and his face. He smiled me, and showed me some passes that I copied. By the moment I was completly sure it was Dani, so I had to asked him the next day. But it wasnt him.

Meaning, you can FORCE things to materialize.\n\nBut you can intercept a dream, with a milder gaze.\n\nAnd you can assemble another world by viewing energy on the wall.\n\nIn that case, there's no gaze at all. It's peripheral vision.\n\nSo it's gaze at 100% for hole burning. It's so intense, it literally looks like this:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/s7axm5nuilw41.jpg?width=892&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e26264b081d4d872987f5a0a5525231cd532141e](https://preview.redd.it/s7axm5nuilw41.jpg?width=892&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e26264b081d4d872987f5a0a5525231cd532141e)\n\nBut you only gaze at 30% for dream intercepting, or you'll burn it up.  The same way you can dissolve phantoms in dreaming, you will evaporate an intercepted dream if you gaze too hard.\n\nAnd your picture seems to show a milder intensity in those sparks you saw first.  Notice how I drew that in an earlier post. What you find and gaze at, to make the dream materialize.

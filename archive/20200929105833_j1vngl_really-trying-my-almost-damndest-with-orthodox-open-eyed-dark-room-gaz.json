Really nothing much happened and I found also sitting up like that for some reason it was so much easier for my mind to want to wander away on tangents because I suppose I didn\u2019t feel that into what I was doing. It was not the most comfortable way for me to practice so I could hear my untamed mind going \u201cDO SOMETHING ELSE,\u201d or \u201cWHATS UR FAVE DINOSAUR.\u201d \u201cWHAT DO U THINK X THOUGHT ABOUT Y,\u201d or \u201cOMG STOP,\u201d you get the picture.\n\nThat usual mind reaction to a tedious task that you can\u2019t focus or flow on. \n\nI had so many \u201cmeditation breaks,\u201d or inner dialogue interrupting forcing silence for that first hour it was terrible.\n\nMy eyes kept naturally doing this type of gazing that way like when you focus on those magic image books when your little? Where if you fuzz your eyes and relax them you can see the kinda 3D image revealed? My eyes kept feeling like this with eyes opened. \n\nThere was quite bright moonlight coming thru the window and I have a couple of small l.e.d light from humidifier/ioniser so it\u2019s not exactly totally darkness either! It was a particularly bright moon last night, infact I thought that might help. Dark gazing in the moonlight, sounds sexy no? No, it wasn\u2019t really. \n\nAnd I\u2019d naturally let eyes close when they wanted to for very short periods. But I\u2019d open them back up because this felt against the point of the open eyed dark room practice. I can see why you guys use espressos. I\u2019m dead up for trying it with some double espressos next time actually. \n\nThere was a moment when I opened my eyes back up I became completely fixated and silent on a reflection of the l.e.d light from the humidifier which was reflecting from the tv screen. \n\nThe part in separate reality came to my mind where DJ says to CC to keep his fixated on the one little divet at the end of the river and the green fog would envelop him.\n\nSo I thought something would happen here when I got fixated and silent on this little reflection of light. I thought this was it, here it comes! But nothing much did. \n\nHey! It wasn\u2019t totally fruitless! I got very vague swirls of colour, I got a very transparent swirling pole of blue colour like a barbers stick about 4ft long rotating, extreeemely vague that I couldn\u2019t get brighter. I wanted to try scooping or reaching out but got embarrassed to try because didn\u2019t know if girlfriend was yet asleep and notice me. \n\nIt was nothing like compared to my other practices. \n\nOne take away I\u2019ll say I got from this method, is it really did make me want to force silence more because I was finding it more difficult in this position to do. I was getting so frustrated with my inner dialogue I was just in my head saying, almost shouting \u201cFORCE SILENCE,\u201d every time I could sense the first uttering of a dialogue in my head, I might aswell have just been saying \u201cSHUT UP,\u201d. It kinda worked! That was valuable and I\u2019ll probably use that again.\n\nI will try this method again don\u2019t worry! For longer than an hour! Maybe when the moon isn\u2019t so bright. \n\nBut here\u2019s kinda why I haven\u2019t it done it extremely regularly and also the main beef of the story.\n\nAfter the hour I just followed my heart and said, ah, time to lie down. In my spot where I usually do and have had all my previous success.\n\nThat\u2019s eyes shut with my top north and tail south. Next to my girlfriend if she\u2019s in.\n\nAnd I really see how much better this works for me instantly, as soon as I done it. Also my inner dialogue just completely dampens in this state, I\u2019m just at peace. I\u2019m not against my grain. Silence is easier. \n\nVery quickly after doing that I got swoops and a couple of orbs. Second attention can come dramatically fast for me this way! \n\nHere\u2019s another weird trick I\u2019ve learned from doing this;  well so I\u2019ve told you I\u2019m top north tails south. I sleep that way because Manly P Hall says you should sleep that way in northern hemisphere to correctly align with the energies of the magnetic poles. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, but I\u2019ve been a deep Manly P Hall fanboy for like 15 years so whatever. \n\nSo because I\u2019m lying that way means my face/eyes are either facing east or west, if you see what I mean, cos lying down on your front your head is turned to the side. \n\nSo yes, the weird trick, is if I\u2019m facing west and looking for the colours and the second attention (the outline of the room with eyes closed) and it isn\u2019t happening quickly, after a bit of time, I just turn to face east, it seems to have helped with this a lot, and last night in particular, it was a total sure success. It may be because it\u2019s brighter towards the east of the room? It could be, but if I\u2019m struggling while facing west and I face east I get second attention quick! And almost instantly last night when I done it! \n\nI thought \u201cbrilliant! Why didn\u2019t I just lie down with my eyes closed an hour ago?\u201d \n\nThe extent of the results last night, which maybe weren\u2019t optimum because of how tired I\u2019d gotten myself forcing the waking open eyed sitting up gazing, were this.\n\nThe second attention was reached in that I could make out my room. The purple puffs came in and started doing there thing. They were really dancing last night.\n\nBasically the way I see them react recently including last night is, they float within my gaze, they expand in a gaseous way, then they retract in on themselves, like a dying star, and when that happens, something solid often emerges! Last night I seen atleast a letter L emerge from one, and a strange ass solid looking contraption looking thing emerge from the other. I think there was more but this is from what I remember. It was from exactly this motion that I seen a little fairy come out of a puff on one my recent practices. No little fairy last night that I remember. \n\nWhen I say they retract it on themselves like a dying star, they do expand back out btw, but it\u2019s usually on the retraction that something emerges. \n\nAlso i felt very conscious last night of my assemblage point atleast twice. Isn\u2019t it a great feeling?? To anyone who\u2019s felt it?? It\u2019s great! \n\nEverything goes a bit sort of, darker and brighter, at the same time, and you feel like you\u2019ve just sank into a different frequency/pressure, and you really notice it from your breathing! When these feelings happen your breathing does really change! \n\nYou need to understand when I do this practice I\u2019m also combining it with attempted dreaming, so I get to the second attention and witness the puffs and other circus show that happens when you get there, and my whole idea is I hold that for as long as possible until the dreaming visions come in, where I have to stay extra focused to not be lulled away by them, and walk consciously into a lucid dream. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t always work you see, it\u2019s tricky, but it does sometimes! \n\nWell I don\u2019t recall walking into dream lucid last night, and racking my brains I hardly even remember much dream visions swooping in after the purple puffs so one have must have lulled me away to slumber quite quickly last night, the sneaky wee bastard. \n\nAnyway, that was what resulted with last nights attempt at orthodox dark room! And what it resulted in! Thanks for reading if you stuck with this stupidly long ramble. I\u2019m happy how my lying down with eyes closed gets results for me but I\u2019m my dead up for trying again sitting up eyes open, preferably with not a bright a moon and I\u2019d like to try the espresso soon too! \n\nTLDR: 1solve_et talks too much and he\u2019s sorry.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Really trying my almost damndest with orthodox open eyed dark room gazing.", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "link_ids": ["t3_ifu1bv", "t3_if5koq", "t3_ienqgj", "t3_ie01zd", "t3_idn0fa", "t3_idh7ju", "t3_iczlw5", "t3_icv2ot", "t3_irms6p", "t3_irglig", "t3_iqzit7", "t3_iq7jdg", "t3_iof5ib", "t3_invu3w", "t3_imlozg", "t3_ilzfhg", "t3_ildkri", "t3_ijgd33", "t3_iixdqk", "t3_ihms98", "t3_ih21eh", "t3_ih44uo", "t3_igh7ta", "t3_igday4", "t3_jcxlwj", "t3_hp41du", "t3_kdsew2", "t3_kz7y8a", "t3_kz75ql", "t3_kw4lpr", "t3_kvqj52", "t3_knpzzc", "t3_km2pzf", "t3_kj29l8", "t3_kd0b1h", "t3_k641wo", "t3_k4jrfq", "t3_k2paj7", "t3_k2dn7a", "t3_k1fwwj", "t3_jqlctf", "t3_jq09jk", "t3_jp4g2x", "t3_jng0bx", "t3_jmu5w3", "t3_jmsrw3", "t3_jm1fxl", "t3_jkklgr", "t3_jikxdd", "t3_jhb6f9", "t3_jh8142", "t3_jglh8m", "t3_jgb5mx", "t3_jg53re", "t3_jfoaai", "t3_jf4c1u", "t3_je4gyw", "t3_jdlcth", "t3_jby6ff", "t3_jadwdo", "t3_j9fkih", "t3_j96xwg", "t3_j8rmcm", "t3_j7c8fa", "t3_j65s10", "t3_j61w6p", "t3_j43yai", "t3_j40bem", "t3_j3eykq", "t3_j2jxyx", "t3_j261xv", "t3_j1vngl", "t3_j0g2nl", "t3_izm9cx", "t3_iyhkny", "t3_ix9ipe", "t3_ix5a4g", "t3_iw29ja", "t3_iverkv", "t3_iu3yxd", "t3_isv81g", "t3_isnn0y", "t3_ic1ppo", "t3_i9fbj8", "t3_i8kcue", "t3_i795h6", "t3_i5o2m4", "t3_i4tqjj", "t3_i3o4mq", "t3_i2ha3h", "t3_i1ch4u", "t3_i0s7jm", "t3_hzfk4m", "t3_hx8xej", "t3_iyz5md", "t3_ljjdbn", "t3_lfo0wa", "t3_lgzmsv"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 1", "created_at_utc": 1598295005.319, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1620558726.961, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_j1vngl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 6, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1601369913.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really did try my damndest with orthodox dark room last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve just gotten so used to my other lying down method it must just seem to work easier. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was for about an hour I sat in the dark room, actually sitting up cross legged on the corner of our corner couch, gazing looking for swoops and puffs.

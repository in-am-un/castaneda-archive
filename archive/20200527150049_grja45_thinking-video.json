Buffers, busses, scheduled processes, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s basically the philosophy I have too. The tricky part for me is figuring out what&amp;#39;s going on at the lowest level, and what&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;hardware&amp;#39; and what&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;software&amp;#39;.

It tossed out 3/4ths of them.  It actually went through a list, like a judge deciding someone&amp;#39;s fate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Memory is the main thing I&amp;#39;ve been trying to figure out, but I&amp;#39;ve never witnessed it in action, that&amp;#39;s quite beyond anything I&amp;#39;ve ever done, but it sounds interesting. I&amp;#39;m surprised observation didn&amp;#39;t force the words to stick around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the explanation of stopping the world. From the phrase, I had imagined looking around in my world and seeing time had stopped, but I think I understand much better what you mean now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So simple yet so difficult... be fully silent long enough, get magic and travel dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were to hazard a guess, if reality is consensus, magic doesn&amp;#39;t exist because that&amp;#39;s the consensus and silence is what is needed to pull yourself out far enough to access magic, go somewhere else, or check out the nagul. Basically disconnecting yourself from the consensus reality temporarily, because thinking is partaking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also implies a limit of what you can accomplish with magic in the real world because you&amp;#39;re going against consensus, which is why a lot of things you create have a lifespan and why you need multiple sorcerers to make something permanent (making your own consensus). Which would also explain why anything you accomplish with magic always has another explanation if you bring it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_grja45", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/grja45/thinking_video/fsl5d5n/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1591060118.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1591060118.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fsj8iay", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fsgwovb", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;How did I come up with the words to type in this sentence?\n\nMost of our brain is a giant parallel processing structure.

You can rapidly switch between the two, but you can't do both at the same time. You can switch back and forth very quickly, so quickly that it feels like you're doing both at the same time, but it feels like a balancing act cause the moment something takes more than an instant of thought (is it a blue dress or a white dress?), it's very easy to 'lose your balance' and stop perceiving as you ponder.\n\nWhen you're perceiving, you're taking in information without judgement and you're present. \n\nWhen you're analyzing, you stop taking in information and you make judgements about that information. I don't just mean like, 'That was wrong', but like, 'Those shapes look like a car', or 'these events are connected and this is the plot'. And once I decide what's going on, I notice I more or less filter that out because it has been 'decided', which means if it changes or evolves, I probably won't notice.\n\nThe longer you analyze, the further away from the perceiving you go until at some point you realize you have no idea what you're even looking at anymore and you have to switch back to perceiving to figure out what's going on and get caught up.\n\nAnd I've noticed that when I'm looking at hypnagogia, it's that switch to deciding that reverses my progress very quickly.

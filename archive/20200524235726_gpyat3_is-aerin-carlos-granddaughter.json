The only part where we slightly disagree is that Cleargreen/Miles have the single source authority to teach something related to Carlos' teachings. I understand your point, like they were direct apprentices with handover from Carlos himself... \n\nBut. My point is, if someone has learned something valuable and working, which is more than some movements to teach. And was not a direct apprentice, but still tries to teach courses for a fee, why is it wrong automatically? I am not referring to any specific group or courses, but in principle. Just imagine some people learned some dreaming or stalking way beyond what official apprentices (you and Cholita excluded) can offer, and they just want to take some fee for their time messing up with fussy and lazy students. But the offering is valid and has real magic. In that case, I think it is still an option for some people. Maybe such guys don't have a paper that they are apprentices of apprentices, but if they can provide stuff that works, is it so wrong?\n\nThe problem emerges when we deal with people like Ken or Miguel who just want a cash in or are delusional leading people to nowhere. The hard part is \"how to differ?\" for many people. Well, the way I see it is by \"believing without believing\", meaning you go, you try, you draw conclusions based on the experience.  But only if you are honest with yourself and don't buy into placebos. The fake naguals and scams are visible very quickly. By the way, if a person claims to be a Nagual I would see it as a red line already. No one adequate enough would try to do this.\n\nI have tried this approach with many places to learn something.

The only part where we slightly disagree is that Cleargreen/Miles have the single source authority to teach something related to Carlos&amp;#39; teachings. I understand your point, like they were direct apprentices with handover from Carlos himself... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But. My point is, if someone has learned something valuable and working, which is more than some movements to teach. And was not a direct apprentice, but still tries to teach courses for a fee, why is it wrong automatically? I am not referring to any specific group or courses, but in principle. Just imagine some people learned some dreaming or stalking way beyond what official apprentices (you and Cholita excluded) can offer, and they just want to take some fee for their time messing up with fussy and lazy students. But the offering is valid and has real magic. In that case, I think it is still an option for some people. Maybe such guys don&amp;#39;t have a paper that they are apprentices of apprentices, but if they can provide stuff that works, is it so wrong?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem emerges when we deal with people like Ken or Miguel who just want a cash in or are delusional leading people to nowhere.

I tried to teach just one, which I considered the most simple, to the Taiwanese bosses&amp;#39; son.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I could video him doing it, since Cholita refuses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He couldn&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve purchased a toymation doll to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Cleargreen is fine.  We need teachers.  But I fear the next gen from cleargreen, after Reni and Carol are gone, will have modified everything, removing what Carlos put in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, my only beef with cleargreen is them having left Carlos as a &amp;quot;fraud&amp;quot; on the net.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go anywhere, to any serious esoteric discussion group, bring up Carlos, and you&amp;#39;ll be told he was a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even in the Lucid dreaming forum, which got it&amp;#39;s momentum directly from Carlos!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s universal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably because of Robert Marshall not doing his homework. I hope he takes advantage of all of the historical information in here, tracing Carlos around Mexico, obviously practicing sorcery. His biography will be a farce otherwise.  And I&amp;#39;ll make sure he gets full credit for being a lazy biographer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Carlos&amp;#39; reputation shot, the only ones who will continue to read Carlos&amp;#39; books and get inspired are the ones who are careless about what they practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ditsy ones.  Needy people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps isolated from the cultural knowledge that Carlos was raked over the coals here. And plagued with phony sorcerers trying to cash in on him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as in the Eastern Bloc.    Maybe the language barrier prevents them from knowing the history well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And those are susceptible to being inventory and teacher collectors, which is also very bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time you drive to a phony nagual workshop, you just lost the chance to do wonders, in the dark!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been running into a little creature lately.  Not an IOB.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;God only knows what that thing is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the time it would take to drive to a couple of workshops, I can learn more about it, directly.

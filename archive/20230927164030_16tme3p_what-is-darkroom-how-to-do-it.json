i got back in bed and closed my eyes and slept for a short while. it was too early to get a good night sleep, so i just had a short catnap. after wakeing up i continued to look out into the darkness for something interesting while trying to be silent. i think the short sleep helped me with the silence. i'm not sure anymore if i really saw something or if it was just my mind which played tricks on me, but for maybe half a minute i saw a purple something, a little bit like a nasa photo nebula (without the bright stars) but also a little like a mist which was also moving away from me (unfortunately). while it lasted i was happy and i enjoyed it - it was fun.\n\nnebula

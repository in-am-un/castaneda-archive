I puzzled over how people deceive themselves into believing they can get silent, after putting in a lot of work to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan explained it easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He lied to win an argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I thought about it, more evidence of him lying to win arguments was obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;m at it...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know what lateral shifts on the blue line are like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, we could compile better info, if we got the women to talk about what happens on their period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could use that, to &amp;quot;speed up&amp;quot; new witches.  Point out what the second attention is, based on their existing experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, since meditators and shamanic drummers do in fact reach the green line,  some us ought to experiment with lateral shifts on the green line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really not hard to make the assemblage point move horizontally!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just find some &amp;quot;weirdness&amp;quot; and act as if it were real. Try to &amp;quot;do things&amp;quot; with it, as if it were like any other real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe any advanced dark room gazers can do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t remain at the green line anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But new people who just barely reach the green line, could do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The value might be, to help out shamanism in general, without trying to convert them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some shamanism &amp;quot;teachers&amp;quot; are out there sucking up cash from unsuspecting people, and not delivering much of anything but a quick green zone vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, meditation systems hold people prisoner by allowing them to see the green zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just the &amp;quot;excuse&amp;quot; they need, to believe they have the most powerful meditation technique around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of devious in fact.  The fake &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot; of the world, simply get someone to the green zone to confuse them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you try to free those people, they&amp;#39;ll tell the story of their mild green zone experiences as if that proves they are on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ozvekd/the_most_famous_phrase_of_the_books/h82huct/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1628352819.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ozvekd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_ozvekd", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hfm53v9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hfkibzd", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Oddly, women can be the most accepting of the behavior of Carlos, but also the most hysterical.\n\nI think it's because women are stuck with men.

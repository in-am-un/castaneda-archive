Although it lasted only 10 seconds long, it was an unforgettable experience. \n\nWhat I can only describe as a 3D object. It looked so real I could touch it. I had my eyes closed and I was fading out of a dream and it morphed into this object. Not a blurry looking image but a clear object I was seeing as if my eyes were open. It looked like a fanned out deck of photos. The pictures had edges and shadows and looked absolutely real. I kept my eyes tight so I could focus on the whole thing. The photos were flipping over really fast like a card Rolodex would do, or an old crank Mutoscope movie viewer. There must have been hundreds of them and they were all different. I laid completely still and felt my heart beating a mile a minute. I watched them flipping extremely fast. It continued like this for the most part then began slowing down and got blurry towards the end. They appeared to be in color and also black and white. \n\nThe strangest part of this experience wasn\u2019t just the vivid Rolodex of pictures but it\u2019s that I could feel my entire conscious mind soaking up a lot of these snap shots. And each one took me on a brief journey that seemed identical to the dreams I had during the night. Kind of like a summery. Each single dream sequence filled with the same exact emotion. These dream pictures were spinning nearly as fast as a strobe light at one point and for some strange reason I was able to absorb entire sequences in a mere second. My state of consciousness was in awe. I tried to distinguish between them but it seemed like there wasn\u2019t any time.

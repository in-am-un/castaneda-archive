Assistants to the head angry chimp.  \"Better mannered\" male chimps.\n\nBut mostly men really suck.  And the fantasies of \"Jungle Domination\" make it very difficult for them to look down into the green station on that map, to find some real magic.\n\nThey keep thinking about how when they find it, the other chimps will have to bow down to them, and they won't have to beat their chests until they drop from frustration.  If they win, others will bring them food and set it at their feat. \n\nAnd they can live the \"Easy Chimp Life\". Sit on their rock throne, as the \"wise and powerful \"chimp zen\" master of all.\n\nThe women have no chance to kick the ass of the head male chimp.\n\nSo they aren't bent on world domination.\n\nWhich gives them a HUGE advantage, looking down into the green station.\n\nNot to mention, their assemblage point is never fully stable up there at the blue line.\n\nIt's almost as if the women have a dirty little secret, and while hunting and gathering as is one of their favorite hobbies (\"shopping\"), they sample the forbidden red berries that get you stoned.\n\nNot so much the head chest beating chimp can take advantage of them.\n\nBut enough that they've been \"power planted\" up the wazoo, and their assemblage point is easy to move. And they see those green line effects all the time. They just don't value them, because the male chimps are oblivious.  So there's no drive in the tribe, to encourage them to go further into \"red berry land\".\n\nSo they ought to kick butt, as witches.  Over males. Because they've already done, what this subreddit tries to get the males to do.\n\nThey've seen magic!\n\nAnd they do kick butt over the males even further along the J curve.\n\nBut apparently they don't have the muscle mass men have, and also don't have the energetic mass to penetrate into some distant realms.\n\nI've seen that myself with Cholita, trying to follow me too far into the tunnels that materialize in my dark room. She just can't pass.\n\nBut if I have her around, my vision of what's inside the tunnels is much stronger.\n\nSo while I might be able to plod directly into the furthest cavern in heaven or hell, my eyesight is very poor without witches.\n\nBottom line: male chimps and female chimps are practically \"different animals\".\n\nAnd the female chimps have to live with the huge angry chest beating, bent on tribal rule supremacy, aggressive male chimps.\n\nSome male chimps  have no chance to dominate, and they tend to get along in the tribe, and the women like hanging out with them.\n\nBut those angry Chimps?\n\nThey really suck.\n\nSo in here when the angry chimps come to try to challenge the leader of the tribe, they definitely can see through that.  At least, after they remove the blinders of other religions and \"systems\" from their eyes.\n\nMale dominated systems I might add, which teach that women are inferior.\n\nIn there they realize, we're only trying to go hunting and gathering of cool magical sights, in a different forest.\n\nWe're shopping at the megamall in the wealthy area of town.\n\nThe J curve.\n\nBut the invading angry chimps are endless.\n\nAnd if tolerated, this place would be destroyed in months.\n\nIt would be nothing but second rate angry chimps trying to put up a good self image. Drowning out any possibility of discussions about advanced magic.\n\nI'm going to animate this.\n\nWesterly Witch (Cholita) drives Taisha and Florinda (in hoodies so you don't see them), to \"Tito Pakora's International festival of peace and love\".\n\nHe's \"The real Don Juan\" (trademark symbol).\n\nShe steps into the convention grounds, and can't believe what she sees.\n\n\"FIVE PRONG NAGUAL OVER HERE!!!\"\n\n\"TOLTEC FRANCHISES $$$$$$\"\n\n\"The Real Apprentice of don Juan, Ken Running Eagle\".\n\nIt's an endless sea of the worst crap you can imagine, with not a square inch of the convention groups available to relax and escape the madness.\n\nRows and rows of \"book signing\" booths, with autographed pictures available for $20.\n\n\"Meet Armando and Juan, and complete part of your Sorcery Journey!\"\n\nIt's hell.\n\nThat's our situation, and a picture is worth a thousand words.\n\nSo unfortunately, the male chimps who want the tribe to survive have to fight back.\n\nAnd subconsciously, the female chimps don't see much difference.\n\nBoth are angry, and both might attack you while swinging their fists at the invading males.\n\nSo they don't like it.\n\nThere's nothing we can do about that.  We can't \"fix\" or adjust anything at all.\n\nIt's just basic instincts at work.\n\nAnd worse, there's no chance for timid apes to venture into the forest of the J curve anyway.  \n\nMale or female.\n\nThe female chimps hanging around who are put off by the need to protect the tribe through violence, aren't really driven to seek new places to hunt and gather.\n\nThey're looking for \"cozy\".\n\nThere's also a benefit to the women having to be uncomfortable, watching the battle to protect the tribe.\n\nIt allows them to see that the invading angry chimps are actually broken, sad beings. Not powerful at all. They can barely fend for themselves. And desperately need to become leader of something, so others can take care of them.\n\nThey're so weak, they'll back down if you put in some effort to stop them.\n\nThey don't consider female chimps to be much of a threat, so they listen more when told they're out of line.\n\nIt's like having their mommy scold them.", "edited": 1669822381.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iyd9l7i", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was playing with Silent Knowledge a long time last night, and got a lecture on how different women are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to blame it on genetics, but in the end it&amp;#39;s an energetic feature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But also too hard to understand from that point of view.

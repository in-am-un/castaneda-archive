Seeing a few puffs once in a while, but otherwise feeling fairly bored.\n\nWhen you get past that, then you'll be on the right track!  Until then, I suppose you just have to suffer.\n\nI also got my \"La Gorda's\" eye to return!   That was nice to see.  Couldn't find the \"cat\" back where the middle of the eyeball was located in space.  The cute little guy was back there yesterday, if I looked for him.  So that the weird eyeball in the middle didn't seem dangerous.\n\nMaybe that was just a trick to get me to accept that darned eye.  I like cats.\n\nIf it had been a squirrel, I probably would have fled to my car and grabbed Cholita by the arm whether she liked it or not.\n\nMinus the cat, I don't know what La Gorda's eye is really good for.\n\nBut it's nice to play with because it's so beautiful.\n\nWe're NOT on the same path as the lineages or the old seers.  We have our own course.\n\nAnd we MUST follow the \"Intent of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico\".\n\nCan't follow the \"Chinese wisdom\" path.  Can't indulge in being a \"blissful Guru\".    Can't obsess over popular nonsense like \"Energy Centers\", or \"Breath Work\".\n\nThose are cheap franchises designed to steal money from naive people in search of real magic.  People who also seek magic but are too lazy to do any actual work,  and who still have no magic, pretend to and use other people as a resource,  to convince themselves they got it.  When they didn't.\n\nThe more \"respect and fame\" they can gather, and the more cash, the more they feel certain they have actually achieved their goal.\n\nWhen they didn't even get started yet.\n\nA beginner monk is far better off than the Dali Lama himself, if you consider his chances to actually learn magic and explore reality freely.\n\nThose outside \"systems\" are all leaks in your intent bucket if you try to keep them.\n\nThe very thing we need to fill is like a bucket with holes in it.\n\nIntent, the thing that creates our reality, stores into containers.\n\nIt doesn't care what kind of container.\n\nHow could it possibly understand that?  The emanations are infinite and the number of \"realities\" out there can never be counted.\n\nSomewhere else,  a \"container\" might be completely incomprehensible to humans.\n\nBut intent still has to fill them!\n\nSo it doesn't care what kind of container you want to fill. Once you make the container obvious, intent begins to store into it.\n\nIt can even be a tensegrity form! Or a series of forms you want to use for \"practical magic\".\n\nA witches cauldron is like a container for intent!  The witch chants and uses her magic and potions to \"store\" into the cauldron, until the spell is ready.\n\nIf her cauldron has leaks, she's out of luck.\n\nUnless she can store into it, faster than it leaks.\n\nYour main \"intent container\", as far as learning sorcery, is HOW you have chosen to learn it.\n\nThat's your \"main bucket\".\n\nConsider this from the point of view of the Eagle.\n\nThe eagle creates bubbles on the emanations, and fills them with awareness.\n\nHe creates \"containers\" into which intent can store.\n\nWith the \"egg\" encasing it, the awareness he gives us can't dissipate too thin to be self-aware.\n\nThat's how we finally die. With the egg gone on death the Eagle extracts his price, our stories, and lets our awareness go free.\n\nBut we just dissipate into the dark sea of awareness, until we're too thin to be sentient.\n\nOur goal is to free ourselves from that process, while still being forced to obey it.\n\nAnd our only \"ally\" in that situation, is the force that shapes reality.\n\nThe one that \"skims\" the dark sea, extracts a tiny fraction of the emanations, and energizes those with your own awareness.\n\nWe focus on something, and *intent* builds a reality around it.\n\nIt's our most powerful Ally,  because it's willing to help us \"change directions\".\n\nNever forget this:  Sorcery is the mastery of *intent*!\n\nIf *intent* sees us picking up the chocolate chip cookies first, from the platter it has given us, and when we're done the peanut butter cookies are mostly uneaten, *intent* takes that into account.\n\nThe next platter is likely to have more varieties of chocolate.\n\nThis is a wonderful thing, but you have to be very careful what you let *intent* see!\n\nBecause any \"specifics\" it finds, will alter \"the flow\" of intent.\n\nSend it off in a slightly different direction.\n\nThus Carlos warned us. Over and over.  He said, \"The Intent of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico\".\n\nHe meant that as a severe warning.  That if you want to learn what he showed you in his books, want the intense magic, you have to \"flow\" in the only direction we know which has this.\n\nIt's not anywhere else I can find.\n\nWhich brings me to our biggest problem.\n\nThis is an open discussion group.  That means, people try to make it \"cozy\" for themselves.\n\nThey try to turn this into a new river of shit, where they have more power than in the larger one where all humans are drowning.\n\nWe get an endless barrage of people with chips on their shoulders, trying to justify their own delusions.  They come here because they see pictures of real magic, and they've been lying to themselves that they either have real magic, or are on a sure path to it.\n\nWhen they aren't.\n\nSo they try to alter the course in here. Try to prove to themselves, their pretend magic is superior.\n\nThey add \"leaks\" to everyone in here, to make themselves feel better.\n\nWe might all say, \"Who cares?  We can ignore them!\"\n\nBut you can't.  That's just vanity and glossing, to think you are above dark influences.\n\nHopefully you'll get to hold an \"intent blob\" in your hand, like in the upper right of the picture, and in \"abstract waking dreaming\" play with it. To watch how \"intent flows\".\n\nWhat will the blob become?\n\nIt's forming into something as you watch.\n\nBut the instant it resolves what it \"will be\", you can squish it a tiny bit and start over.\n\nWatch the process over and over.\n\nIt's the \"flow of intent\" in your hand.\n\nPlay with that a while and you won't be so sure of how \"tough\" you are, for ignoring \"counter intent\".\n\nIn fact, the lineages weren't so tough they didn't need to devise strategies to keep counter intent away.\n\nStalking for one.\n\nCarlos taught us Zuleica's pass, as an easier way to observe the flow of intent.\n\nBut that's too difficult to use as an example.\n\nThe other aspect of intent which Carlos wanted us to see, was the \"flux\".\n\nI wish I had a better word for that.  The dictionary defines them as almost the same.\n\nBut in my thinking, the \"flux\" is the change from one thing to the other.\n\nThe \"flow\" is just how intent moves in the dark sea.  It does in fact \"find places\" that it can flow into, but it's not the same as an active outside force trying to direct it.\n\nSo Carlos gave us the \"Pandora's Box\" pass. He had a really silly grin on his face, as he did it for us.\n\nWhen no one saw anything, they added it to their list of condemnations of Carlos.\n\nBut in fact, Pandora's box is the most powerful sorcery technique you could imagine.\n\nIt not only works on puffs of our double, but it works on the emanations themselves!\n\nWhen you reach the deep orange zone on the J curve map, keep that in mind.  Pandora's box pass works on the whitish light also!\n\nAnd it even works on entire realities, in \"Silent Knowledge\". That's the purple area on the map.\n\nGod help you if you master that!  Warn me first so I can get far away.\n\nBest to stay with the \"simple\" puffs for a while.\n\nUntil you get past fear.\n\nNow remember that sorcery is actually \"the mastery of intent\".\n\nI could name what it's not, but that's distasteful because it ends up contradicting everything new people stand for.  The junky inventory they try to carry in here.\n\nWhat we need, if we want to maximize the flow of intent and plug as many leaks in our buckets as possible, is to leave the format of an internet discussion group.\n\nAny open \"discussion group\" is merely a smaller version of the river of shit.\n\nWe need to change the idea to where this is a classroom only.\n\nIt's Sorcery 101.\n\nIf you want \"Grinning Guru 101\",  that's on the other end of the campus near the women's showers.\n\nSo that no one is tempted to come in here with chips on their shoulders, to try to wrestle their way above others in a new river of shit.  The smaller copy they believe this discussion group to be.\n\nI theorize, better teaching materials could bring that about.\n\nTo make this into a classroom instead of a free for all.\n\nSome things can't be shown in still photos or descriptions made of text.\n\nWe need audio/visual presentations.  So that \"the flow and flux of intent\" can be clearly shown.\n\nHopefully we can combine the work of creating those materials into a larger unit.\n\nThe way computers can store programming, we can create teaching materials that store knowledge.  It's difficult to create a perfect replica of Dance Home, in 3D video game play format.\n\nBut once that work is done, it's easy to \"drop it into\" a new teaching program.\n\nAnd once you create \"puffs\" that obey the laws of \"puff physics\", with \"whitish light\" which obeys the laws of the orange zone, anyone who wants to can explore those using a 3D video game world. Even discover \"new things\" inside that cartoon world which turn out to be true in the real world.\n\nIt gives non-sorcerers a chance to \"try it out first, before you do all that hard work to gain it for real\".\n\nWe might even be able to create a teaching \"container\", into which intent decides to flow on its own.\n\nAnd if it's an obvious \"class\", and not a \"discussion group\", we might eliminate the bad men who \"flow in\", and try to create new leaks in our containers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Flux and Flow of Intent", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ibdwhgwp2jd91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ibdwhgwp2jd91.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35e36d8fae11727b91d782eafd5f84c0f0b0b4cc"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ibdwhgwp2jd91.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5164db22e9e8aef902826d9d9d0ba714c05350c"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ibdwhgwp2jd91.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e58fd5bff5dd85a3e397c10c741d86abc934c8cb"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ibdwhgwp2jd91.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b9ef41eb4ec30107292f4409fce7f15234b6b5f"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ibdwhgwp2jd91.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c7506a592162247d10700005002ece7bceaf748"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ibdwhgwp2jd91.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e6f107d8c90ec33eb6df5a724a40541a0f13e72"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ibdwhgwp2jd91.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f471e87eef7d09c819caac75c2860ea95a95791f"}, "id": "ibdwhgwp2jd91"}}, "name": "t3_w6ydx5", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/dFcFgHAhA9esJZMU5P6iGQFyBCfP9g0Cd_2LaYrxt6g.jpg", "edited": 1658679218.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1658677013.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ibdwhgwp2jd91.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f471e87eef7d09c819caac75c2860ea95a95791f\"&gt;I \\&amp;quot;get help\\&amp;quot; from the spirit.

Warn me first so I can get far away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best to stay with the &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; puffs for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until you get past fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now remember that sorcery is actually &amp;quot;the mastery of intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could name what it&amp;#39;s not, but that&amp;#39;s distasteful because it ends up contradicting everything new people stand for.  The junky inventory they try to carry in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we need, if we want to maximize the flow of intent and plug as many leaks in our buckets as possible, is to leave the format of an internet discussion group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any open &amp;quot;discussion group&amp;quot; is merely a smaller version of the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to change the idea to where this is a classroom only.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s Sorcery 101.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want &amp;quot;Grinning Guru 101&amp;quot;,  that&amp;#39;s on the other end of the campus near the women&amp;#39;s showers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that no one is tempted to come in here with chips on their shoulders, to try to wrestle their way above others in a new river of shit.  The smaller copy they believe this discussion group to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I theorize, better teaching materials could bring that about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make this into a classroom instead of a free for all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some things can&amp;#39;t be shown in still photos or descriptions made of text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need audio/visual presentations.  So that &amp;quot;the flow and flux of intent&amp;quot; can be clearly shown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we can combine the work of creating those materials into a larger unit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way computers can store programming, we can create teaching materials that store knowledge.  It&amp;#39;s difficult to create a perfect replica of Dance Home, in 3D video game play format.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once that work is done, it&amp;#39;s easy to &amp;quot;drop it into&amp;quot; a new teaching program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And once you create &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot; that obey the laws of &amp;quot;puff physics&amp;quot;, with &amp;quot;whitish light&amp;quot; which obeys the laws of the orange zone, anyone who wants to can explore those using a 3D video game world. Even discover &amp;quot;new things&amp;quot; inside that cartoon world which turn out to be true in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gives non-sorcerers a chance to &amp;quot;try it out first, before you do all that hard work to gain it for real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We might even be able to create a teaching &amp;quot;container&amp;quot;, into which intent decides to flow on its own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if it&amp;#39;s an obvious &amp;quot;class&amp;quot;, and not a &amp;quot;discussion group&amp;quot;, we might eliminate the bad men who &amp;quot;flow in&amp;quot;, and try to create new leaks in our containers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "w6ydx5", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/w6ydx5/the_flux_and_flow_of_intent/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/w6ydx5/the_flux_and_flow_of_intent/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1658677013.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ihgqjq4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1658680008.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_w6ydx5", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Here's some \"evil information\".\n\nA full on seer is able to see the entire inside of your egg.

In this post.\n\nI keep getting lured  by having too much visible magic available to me during my practice session, so that if I stop to drink some ice tea between movements, my energy body is right there swarming around me as intense blue puffs, with jet blackness mixed in.  So that I can't resist playing with Silent Knowledge and end up using a lot of my darkroom practice time just messing around.\n\nI believe that the \"jet blackness\" will eventually turn out to be something we can \"name\".\n\nIdentify.\n\nAnd in sorcery, as I believe don Juan said, \"the naming of something is a very serious affair\".\n\nNow whoever thought that would eventually make sense???\n\nNot me.  It sounded superstitious.  Like old delusional \"Man of Knowledge\" confusions.\n\nBut in fact as a *seer*, something the men of knowledge were not, you can see with your own eyes how objects and places form from Silent Knowledge, and can even be made to return despite their mostly phantom nature.\n\nIt's the use and repetition of them which makes them become \"real enough\".\n\nAnd so naming them is perhaps the first step towards using them in a practical manner.\n\nI'll  have to make up for my missed tensegrity forms at work.\n\nI just had to write this down, when I instantly lost half of it and realized I'd soon lose all of it, as obvious as it seems to be.\n\nLet me try to restore the second half, but it's not quite right.\n\n\"Magical Passes\" are you, doing \"magic\" physically in the air.\n\nMoving around, waving your hands, tapping your foot.\n\nIt's all very pointless from an ordinary point of view, unless you want to gather an audience and have everyone cheer your amazing artistry.\n\nWhich I'm afraid, the Four Cleargreens do.\n\nThey've created \"Attention Seeking Forms\" to replace the \"Magical Forms\".\n\nMovements absolutely magic free.\n\nAnd they like it that way!  Get angry even in Argentina, if you insist the magical forms need to produce real magic.\n\nSomehow Instagram ticks off more Argentinians than other social media.  And they \"fight back\" against the idea that they aren't already accomplished sorcerers.\n\nWhen they actually can't do anything at all.\n\nMiles groupies I'm told.\n\nBut the \"Magical\" forms are something **other** than what you would expect, when you can perceive them in Silent Knowledge.\n\nThey're almost like a substitute,  for being able to play with Silent Knowledge.  As if Carlos understood how seers manipulate Silent Knowledge, and decided to hide the old seer magic our lineage possesses, in martial arts like forms which kind of imitate the \"spirit\" of utilizing Silent Knowledge.\n\nAnd then he literally told us they were \"magic\".  To seal the deal.\n\nIt's in the naming of them!  By calling them \"magical\" you have activated certain emanations.  And if you do them believing they are \"magical\", you are imitating what the old seers did, once they really had magic.\n\nThey played with it!  **Explored** it.\n\nAs I've learned to do.  As you can see in the pictures.\n\nIt becomes an \"alternative internal dialogue\", and helps you finally remove all traces of the ugly normal version.\n\nWhich is driven by self-pity.\n\nWhich drives the double away.\n\nBy doing Tensegrity, you come \"close enough\" as far as the emanations are concerned, to what the old seers discovered.\n\nAnd so your tensegrity forms, and you, are \"pulled\" in that direction.\n\nHowever, Carlos' idea didn't work.  We have to face that.\n\nThe problem was, we didn't remove our internal dialogues.\n\nIt was just too hard perhaps. Or no one wanted to be the \"first sucker\" to put in all that work, only to find Carlos made it all up.\n\nThe good news now is, *none of it was made up*.\n\nWell... maybe stories like Pablito fighting his own mom in a death struggle.\n\nBut besides the odd cover stories of lineages, which I hope we'll do away with from now on,  it all works just as stated!\n\nAnd that becomes super obvious once you can use Silent Knowledge as an alternate internal dialogue.\n\nWhile focused on the magic which inevitably flows in that state, and while waiting to see which magic flows next, you're almost engaged in the same process as an internal dialogue.  Focusing your awareness from \"thing to thing\".  But without focusing on your past and your own worries, which can only make sense in your normal position of the assemblage point.\n\nIt's a BETTER internal dialogue, because any \"thought\" you have in that magical internal dialogue version, can manifest an entire lecture on a topic.  And when you focus on the results, your assemblage point is pulled into perfect alignment with that of your energy body.\n\nThe magical alignment is \"renewed\" with everything you observe, coming from the dark sea of awareness.\n\nCarlos even said that engineers could use SK, to do engineering!  Without having to think up the ideas.\n\nJust pluck new solutions from infinity.\n\nIt's true, I've done that myself.\n\nYou now have an \"external internal dialogue\" where it's not composed of images in your mind, and words, but rather of magical objects and places,  illuminated by your energy body's puffs. And any \"words\" to go along with it are now **meanings**.   Realizations, absent words.\n\nBut which are in fact, the PURPOSE of words.\n\nTo convey meanings.\n\nUnfortunately in a normal internal dialogue, they're all meanings of self-pity.\n\nGrief.\n\nRegrets.\n\nI'm waiting for the day when a Pollyanna type comes here and says that her internal dialogue is not filled with grief!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5soihfh0unsc1.png?width=222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=035d782bbe47cc7dc14eccd098f9117916fc9af8\n\nThat'll be interesting to hear about.  A truly first class witch, a pollyanna must be.\n\nI suppose our truly horrible modern internal dialogue is not inevitable.  Certainly pre-language we didn't have one as bad as this.\n\nAnd it might even be possible to have a \"better\" internal dialogue, which is still based on words.\n\nPerhaps pre-agriculture and pre-money mankind had an internal dialogue which was dominated by doing.  By hunting.  By gathering.  By exploring.  By naming, but not by blaming.\n\nUnfortunately at this point, ours is hopelessly dominated by scheming, regretting, and feeling sorry for yourself.\n\nBut as I said, I screwed up and it's 3AM. Time to get up and go to work.  I'll have to do my magical passes there, in the dark warehouse.\n\nJust keep in mind what I noticed tonight.\n\nYour Silent Knowledge ability to stir your energy body with your hand, and reveal wondrous sights, becomes a sustainable internal dialogue substitute.\n\nYou get to play with real magic, no longer having to force off your internal dialogue.\n\nYou just gaze at the flow of magic instead.\n\nSpeaking of gazing, it is perhaps the fastest path because it activates \"proto-silent knowledge\" in the \"weirdness\" it extracts from the things you gaze at.\n\nA sparkle on the corner of a pile of leaves.\n\nA quick dream vision from gazing so long, and forgetting where you are.\n\nGazing simulates this very thing, the \"alternate internal dialogue\", but at a beginner's level.\n\nDarkroom does the same.  But not as quickly. And gazing doesn't bring out your double, whereas darkroom does.\n\nThat's why darkroom emphasizes visible magic in the air.\n\nSo that your eyes can latch onto that, and help you reduce that nasty self-pity motivated person you were raised to be, helping you to become what humans are meant to be.\n\nSpooky apes.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Stirring The Multiverse: An Alternate Internal Dialogue", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"5soihfh0unsc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 145, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5soihfh0unsc1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56dea0dda7978e77b2d19cb7780e86e875a2e437"}, {"y": 291, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5soihfh0unsc1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c51a32f69c79a2d78746948a433a10c10dca9622"}], "s": {"y": 300, "x": 222, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5soihfh0unsc1.png?width=222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=035d782bbe47cc7dc14eccd098f9117916fc9af8"}, "id": "5soihfh0unsc1"}, "vths3yzhgosc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vths3yzhgosc1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd718777ca8e7dfd0b07d1ae3c4ae5496f562825"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vths3yzhgosc1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=342fdc0f8a6fcc1668f650803743f3b177f5064f"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vths3yzhgosc1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f7fd6506daa1e17115c11adfb1a64b8800173b8"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vths3yzhgosc1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=562cc282dd767afba69cf2e5afaf8ad9540f0aa2"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vths3yzhgosc1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2569be9cf39ebed8d457846b7c4d621cc5e44eeb"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vths3yzhgosc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da1187eecc0860ed8f5dd70e549306ab2952fd1a"}], "s": {"y": 3072, "x": 3072, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vths3yzhgosc1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a68f5512df3d0ed0f0e340f706fe285ef950a2d"}, "id": "vths3yzhgosc1"}}, "name": "t3_1bweqrd", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 36, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/0BAPE8PBOV-zPbBuqaf6LW31cYbIrd6oEyia93N6KPM.jpg", "edited": 1712330119.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1712313205.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vths3yzhgosc1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2a68f5512df3d0ed0f0e340f706fe285ef950a2d\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/vths3yzhgosc1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2a68f5512df3d0ed0f0e340f706fe285ef950a2d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really messed up tonight, ending my practice too soon because I realized this very thing.

And gazing doesn&amp;#39;t bring out your double, whereas darkroom does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why darkroom emphasizes visible magic in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that your eyes can latch onto that, and help you reduce that nasty self-pity motivated person you were raised to be, helping you to become what humans are meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spooky apes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "1bweqrd", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1bweqrd/stirring_the_multiverse_an_alternate_internal/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/1bweqrd/stirring_the_multiverse_an_alternate_internal/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1712313205.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kygyqx3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kyd7xo1", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I like the \"what war\" idea.\n\nMaybe over time I can hijack that and redefine \"warrior\"?\n\nAt war with self-pity is what it ought to be.\n\nNOT \"pity\".\n\nSelf-pity.\n\nPeople confuse removing self-pity to reach \"the place of no pity\" with being cold to others.\n\nActually as Clara said, sorcerers love with all of their heart.\n\nThey just don't cling to what they love.\n\nWhich makes it impossible to do that \"with all of your heart\".\n\nCarlos still had Joanie Baker living at Pandora after all these years, the last time I visited.\n\nI wonder if the witches took her along with them?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kygyqx3", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the &amp;quot;what war&amp;quot;

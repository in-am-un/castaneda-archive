The first is the familiar physical body which all of us can perceive. The second is the luminous body which is a cocoon that only seers can perceive; a cocoon that gives us the appearance of giant luminous eggs.\n\nHe had also said that one of the most important goals of sorcery is to reach the luminous cocoon; a goal which is fulfilled through the sophisticated use of dreaming, and through a rigorous systematic exertion he called not-doing. He defined not-doing as an unfamiliar act which engages our total being by forcing us to become conscious of its luminous segment.\n\nIn order to explain these concepts, don Juan made a three-part, uneven division of our consciousness.\n\nHe called the smallest the first attention, and said that it is the consciousness that every normal person has developed in order to deal with the daily world. It encompasses the awareness of the physical body.\n\nAnother larger portion he called the second attention, and described it as the awareness we need in order to perceive our luminous cocoon and to act as luminous beings. He said that the second attention remains in the background for the duration of our lives unless it is brought forth through deliberate training or by an accidental trauma. He said the second attention encompasses the awareness of the luminous body.\n\nHe called the last portion, which was the largest, the third attention-an immeasurable consciousness which engages undefinable aspects of the awareness of the physical and the luminous bodies.\n\nI asked him if he himself had experienced the third attention. He said that he was on the periphery of it, and that if he ever entered it completely, I would know it instantly because all of him would become what he really was; an outburst of energy.\n\nHe added that the battlefield of warriors was the second attention, which was something like a training ground for reaching the third attention. The second attention was a state rather difficult to arrive at, but very fruitful once it was attained.\n\n\"The pyramids are harmful,\" Pablito went on. \"Especially to unprotected sorcerers like ourselves. They are worse yet to formless warriors like la Gorda. The Nagual said that there is nothing more dangerous than the evil fixation of the second attention.\n\n\"When warriors learn to focus on the weak side of the second attention nothing can stand in their way. They become hunters of men; ghouls. Even if they are no longer alive, they can reach for their prey through time as if they were present here and now.\n\n\"And because prey is what we become if we walk into one of those pyramids, the Nagual called them traps of the second attention.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHere's a comment from the editor of the collected books.  since the original collection included Armando, whoever collected them didn't have any sorcery knowledge.  This comment is completely in error!  Just keep that in mind when searching those \"searchable books\".\n\n\\*\\*\n\n\"The other face is the more difficult to reach and it happens when dreamers focus their second attention on items that are not in or from this world, such as the journey into the unknown. \\[\\~ the world of the third attention\\]  &lt; The part in brackets was added and is horribly wrong!  The Unknown is NOT the 3rd attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis quote clarifies that.  The 3rd attention is after you light up all the emanations, the cocoon burns away, and you become a specialized form of inorganic being. \"The Abstract\" on the o ther hand, is fully accessible in darkroom!\n\n\\*\\*\n\nWhat the rule stated was that one could keep the awareness which is ordinarily relinquished at the moment of dying.\n\nDon Juan could not explain what it meant to keep that awareness, or perhaps he could not even conceive of it. His benefactor had told him that at the moment of crossing, one enters into the third attention, and the body in its entirety is kindled with knowledge. Every cell at once becomes aware of itself, and also aware of the totality of the body.\n\nHis benefactor had also told him that this kind of awareness is meaningless to our compartmentalized minds. Therefore the crux of the warrior's struggle was not so much to realize that the crossing over stated in the rule meant crossing to the third attention, but rather to conceive that there exists such an awareness at all.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nDon Juan said that in the beginning the rule was to him something strictly in the realm of words. He could not imagine how it could lapse into the domain of the actual world and its ways.\n\nUnder the effective guidance of his benefactor, however, and after a great deal of work, he finally succeeded in grasping the true nature of the rule, and totally accepted it as a set of pragmatic directives rather than a myth. From then on, he had no problem in dealing with the reality of the third attention.\n\nThe only obstacle in his way arose from his being so thoroughly convinced that the rule was a map that he believed he had to look for a literal opening in the world, a passageway. Somehow he had become needlessly stuck at the first level of a warrior's development.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis comment points out that there is in fact some aspect of the 3rd attention visible from the our normal first and second attention points of view.  Since the other says you burn if you enter the 3rd, I suppose you can \"partially\" light up too many emanations. I've done that. It is quite amazing. Impossible to remember.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nDon Juan explained to me at great length that Florinda was one of the foremost practitioners of stalking because she had been trained in every intricacy of it by his benefactor and four or his female warriors who were stalkers.\n\nFlorinda was the first female warrior to come into don Juan's world; and because of that, she was to be my personal guide not only in the art of stalking, but also in the mystery of the third attention if I ever got there.\n\nDon Juan did not elaborate on this. He said it would have to wait until I was ready to learn stalking, and then to enter into the third attention.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis one again makes it sound like you have to die, to enter the third attention. However, now there is in fact a passageway.  Instead of you simply move your assemblage point across the entire range in 1 second, to light them all up.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nDon Juan said that his benefactor and his party, in spite of their feelings of inadequacy, or perhaps because of those feelings, did find their freedom. They did enter into the third attention- not as a group, however, but one by one. The fact that they found the passageway was the final corroboration of the truth contained in the rule. The last one to leave the world of everyday-life awareness was his benefactor. He complied with the rule and took don Juan's Nagual woman with him.\n\nAs the two of them dissolved into total awareness, don Juan and all his warriors were made to 'explode from within'- he could find no other way of describing the feeling entailed in being forced to forget all they had witnessed of their benefactor's world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis one sort of clears it up.  They're just \"looking at it\".  This is accessible with Silent Knowledge.\n\nSilvio Manuel added that he expected us to become familiar with the third attention by placing ourselves at the foot of the Eagle over and over. He prepared us for the jolt.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHe told me that I had to start by learning first the intricacies of dreaming. He then put me under Zuleica's supervision. He admonished me to be impeccable and practice meticulously whatever I learned, and above all, to be careful and deliberate in my actions so as not to exhaust my life force in vain. He said that the prerequisite for entrance into any of the three stages of attention is the possession of life force, because without it warriors cannot have direction and purpose. He explained that upon dying our awareness also enters into the third attention; but only for an instant as a purging action just before the Eagle devours it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next time don Juan took me to see Florinda- just before he left me at the door- he repeated what she had told me; that the time was approaching for him and his party to enter into the third attention. Before I could question him, he shoved me inside the house. His shove sent me not only into the house, but into my keenest state of awareness. I saw the wall of fog.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIn this respect, dreaming and stalking led to the same end, the entering into the third attention. It was important for a warrior, however, to know and practice both. She said that for women it took different configurations in the luminous body to master one or the other. Men, on the other hand, could do both with a degree of ease, yet they could never get to the level of proficiency that the women attained in each art.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIn our next meeting Florinda summed up what she called her last-minute instructions. She asserted that since the joint assessment of the Nagual Juan Matus and his party of warriors had been that I did not need to deal with the world of everyday life, they taught me dreaming instead of stalking.\n\nShe explained that this assessment had been radically modified, and that they had found themselves in an awkward position. They did not have any more time to teach me stalking.\n\nShe had to stay behind on the periphery of the third attention in order to fulfill her assignment at a later time when I would be ready. On the other hand, if I were to leave the world with them, she was exonerated from that responsibility.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nShe said that Silvio Manuel had harangued them. He told them that they had had sufficient training to try once again to cross. What they needed to enter fully into the other self was to abandon the intent of their first attention. Once they were in the awareness of the other self the power of the Nagual Juan Matus and his party would pick them up and lift them off into the third attention with great facility- something they could not do if the apprentices were in their normal awareness.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe remained seated for what I thought was only an instant, yet I felt a surge of unusual energy in my body. I believed that we had sat down and then immediately stood up.\n\nWhen I asked the Nagual woman why we got up so quickly, she replied that we had been sitting there for several hours, and that someday before I entered into the third attention, all of it would come back to me.\n\nLa Gorda stated that not only did she have the sensation that we sat in that room only for an instant, but that she was never told that it had been otherwise.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"Seers say that there are three types of attention,\" don Juan went on. \"When they say that, they mean it just for human beings, not for all the sentient beings in existence. But the three are not just types of attention, they are rather three levels of attainment. They are the first, second, and third attention; each of them an independent domain; complete in itself.\"\n\nHe explained that the first attention in man is animal awareness which has been developed through the process of experience into a complex, intricate, and extremely fragile faculty that takes care of the day-to-day world in all its innumerable aspects. In other words, everything that one can think about is part of the first attention.\n\n\"The first attention is everything we are as average men,\" he continued. \"By virtue of such an absolute rule over our lives, the first attention is the most valuable asset that the average man has. Perhaps it is even our only asset.\n\n\"Taking into account its true value, the new seers started a rigorous examination of the first attention through seeing. Their findings molded their total outlook; and the outlook of all their descendants even though most of their descendants do not understand what those seers really saw.\"\n\nHe emphatically warned me that the conclusions of the new seers' rigorous examination had very little to do with reason or rationality because in order to examine and explain the first attention, one must see it. Only seers can do that.\n\nYet, to examine what seers see in the first attention is essential. It allows the first attention the only opportunity it will ever have to realize its own workings.\n\n\"In terms of what seers see, the first attention is the glow of awareness developed to an ultra shine,\" he continued. \"But it is a glow fixed on the surface of the cocoon, so to speak. It is a glow that covers the known.\n\n\"The second attention, on the other hand, is a more complex and specialized state of the glow of awareness. It has to do with the unknown. It comes about when unused emanations inside man's cocoon are utilized.\n\n\"The reason I called the second attention specialized is that in order to utilize those unused emanations, one needs uncommon, elaborate tactics that require supreme discipline and concentration.\"\n\nHe said that he had told me before when he was teaching me the art of dreaming, that the concentration needed to be aware that one is having a dream is the forerunner of the second attention. That concentration is a form of consciousness that is not in the same category as the consciousness needed to deal with the daily world.\n\nHe said that the second attention is also called the left-side awareness; and it is the vastest field that one can imagine, so vast in fact, that it seems limitless.\n\n\"I wouldn't stray into it for anything in this world,\" he went on. \"It is a quagmire so complex and bizarre that sober seers go into it only under the strictest conditions.\n\n\"The great difficulty is that the entrance into the second attention is utterly easy, and its lure is nearly irresistible.\"\n\nHe said that the old seers, being the masters of awareness, applied their expertise to their own glows of awareness and made them expand to inconceivable limits. They actually aimed at lighting up all the emanations inside their cocoons one band at a time. They succeeded, but oddly enough the accomplishment of lighting up one band at a time was instrumental in their becoming imprisoned in the quagmire of the second attention.\n\n\"The new seers corrected that error,\" he continued, \"and let the mastery of awareness develop to its natural end; which is to extend the glow of awareness beyond the bounds of the luminous cocoon in one single stroke.\n\n\"The third attention is attained when the glow of awareness turns into the fire from within; a glow that kindles, not one band at a time, but all the Eagle's emanations inside man's cocoon.\"\n\nDon Juan expressed his awe for the new seers' deliberate effort to attain the third attention while they are alive and conscious of their individuality.\n\nDon Juan did not consider it worthwhile to discuss the random cases of men and other sentient beings who enter into the unknown and the unknowable without being aware of it.\n\nHe referred to these cases as the Eagle's gift.\n\nHe asserted that for the new seers to enter into the third attention is also a gift, but has a different meaning. It is more like a reward for an attainment.\n\nHe added that at the moment of dying all human beings enter into the unknowable and some of them do attain the third attention; but altogether too briefly and only to purify the food for the Eagle.\n\n\"The supreme accomplishment of human beings,\" he said, \"is to attain that level of attention while retaining the life-force; without becoming a disembodied awareness moving like a flicker of light up to the Eagle's beak to be devoured.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"The Nagual said that it was a guide to the second attention,\" Pablito went on, \"but that it was ransacked and everything destroyed. He told me that some of the pyramids were gigantic not-doings. They were not lodgings but places for warriors to do their dreaming and exercise their second attention. Whatever they did was recorded in drawings and figures that were put on the walls.\n\n\"Then another kind of warrior must've come along; a kind who didn't approve of what the sorcerers of the pyramid had done with their second attention, and destroyed the pyramid and all that was in it.\n\n\"The Nagual believed that the new warriors must've been warriors of the third attention, just as he himself was. Warriors who were appalled by the evilness of the fixation of the second attention. The sorcerers of the pyramids were too busy with their fixation to realize what was going on. When they did, it was too late.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI believe there aren't any more in the books  \n\nSummary: Stalking can lead you to the third attention, but we don't have info on how.\n\nAnd it's pretty clear, to enter it you have to die.\n\nYou can also use the second attention to navigate to the feet of the eagle, where you can get a glimpse of the third attention.\n\nBut you still don't \"enter it\".", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Three Attentions", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_tt6ars", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1648751378.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quotes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan had said that our total being consists of two perceivable segments.

They are the first, second, and third attention; each of them an independent domain; complete in itself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He explained that the first attention in man is animal awareness which has been developed through the process of experience into a complex, intricate, and extremely fragile faculty that takes care of the day-to-day world in all its innumerable aspects. In other words, everything that one can think about is part of the first attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The first attention is everything we are as average men,&amp;quot; he continued. &amp;quot;By virtue of such an absolute rule over our lives, the first attention is the most valuable asset that the average man has. Perhaps it is even our only asset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Taking into account its true value, the new seers started a rigorous examination of the first attention through seeing. Their findings molded their total outlook; and the outlook of all their descendants even though most of their descendants do not understand what those seers really saw.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He emphatically warned me that the conclusions of the new seers&amp;#39; rigorous examination had very little to do with reason or rationality because in order to examine and explain the first attention, one must see it. Only seers can do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet, to examine what seers see in the first attention is essential. It allows the first attention the only opportunity it will ever have to realize its own workings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In terms of what seers see, the first attention is the glow of awareness developed to an ultra shine,&amp;quot; he continued. &amp;quot;But it is a glow fixed on the surface of the cocoon, so to speak. It is a glow that covers the known.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The second attention, on the other hand, is a more complex and specialized state of the glow of awareness. It has to do with the unknown. It comes about when unused emanations inside man&amp;#39;s cocoon are utilized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The reason I called the second attention specialized is that in order to utilize those unused emanations, one needs uncommon, elaborate tactics that require supreme discipline and concentration.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that he had told me before when he was teaching me the art of dreaming, that the concentration needed to be aware that one is having a dream is the forerunner of the second attention. That concentration is a form of consciousness that is not in the same category as the consciousness needed to deal with the daily world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that the second attention is also called the left-side awareness; and it is the vastest field that one can imagine, so vast in fact, that it seems limitless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;#39;t stray into it for anything in this world,&amp;quot; he went on. &amp;quot;It is a quagmire so complex and bizarre that sober seers go into it only under the strictest conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The great difficulty is that the entrance into the second attention is utterly easy, and its lure is nearly irresistible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said that the old seers, being the masters of awareness, applied their expertise to their own glows of awareness and made them expand to inconceivable limits. They actually aimed at lighting up all the emanations inside their cocoons one band at a time. They succeeded, but oddly enough the accomplishment of lighting up one band at a time was instrumental in their becoming imprisoned in the quagmire of the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The new seers corrected that error,&amp;quot; he continued, &amp;quot;and let the mastery of awareness develop to its natural end; which is to extend the glow of awareness beyond the bounds of the luminous cocoon in one single stroke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The third attention is attained when the glow of awareness turns into the fire from within; a glow that kindles, not one band at a time, but all the Eagle&amp;#39;s emanations inside man&amp;#39;s cocoon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan expressed his awe for the new seers&amp;#39; deliberate effort to attain the third attention while they are alive and conscious of their individuality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan did not consider it worthwhile to discuss the random cases of men and other sentient beings who enter into the unknown and the unknowable without being aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He referred to these cases as the Eagle&amp;#39;s gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He asserted that for the new seers to enter into the third attention is also a gift, but has a different meaning. It is more like a reward for an attainment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He added that at the moment of dying all human beings enter into the unknowable and some of them do attain the third attention; but altogether too briefly and only to purify the food for the Eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The supreme accomplishment of human beings,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;is to attain that level of attention while retaining the life-force; without becoming a disembodied awareness moving like a flicker of light up to the Eagle&amp;#39;s beak to be devoured.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;********&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Nagual said that it was a guide to the second attention,&amp;quot; Pablito went on, &amp;quot;but that it was ransacked and everything destroyed. He told me that some of the pyramids were gigantic not-doings. They were not lodgings but places for warriors to do their dreaming and exercise their second attention. Whatever they did was recorded in drawings and figures that were put on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then another kind of warrior must&amp;#39;ve come along; a kind who didn&amp;#39;t approve of what the sorcerers of the pyramid had done with their second attention, and destroyed the pyramid and all that was in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Nagual believed that the new warriors must&amp;#39;ve been warriors of the third attention, just as he himself was. Warriors who were appalled by the evilness of the fixation of the second attention. The sorcerers of the pyramids were too busy with their fixation to realize what was going on. When they did, it was too late.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe there aren&amp;#39;t any more in the books  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Summary: Stalking can lead you to the third attention, but we don&amp;#39;t have info on how.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s pretty clear, to enter it you have to die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also use the second attention to navigate to the feet of the eagle, where you can get a glimpse of the third attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you still don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;enter it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable":

So since I had the ability to judge if something is helpful or not, I haven't looked into outdoor gazing and how blinking affects it.\n\nI was investigating Cholita's \"Cat Garden\" a day or two ago, because I got lucky enough to come home and she was out shopping. So for the first time I could go see how she managed that.\n\nIt's more elaborate than I thought, and I still can't possibly explain how she created it.\n\nShe even painted flowers to match what was naturally there coming over the wall, encouraging the plants to grow what must be 2 weeks in just 3 days.\n\nI got the idea to sit in it, and try to figure out what the cat perceives if it goes into there.\n\nBut if Cholita caught me, I'd be in big trouble.\n\nIt might even turn out to be a trap of some kind, both for cats and for me.\n\nBut I suppose, in your case don't even think about blinking.\n\nConsider that don Juan even made faces, including squinty eyes, when he was doing some magic for Carlos.\n\nSuch as reaching up into the air, to pull out a rabbit that looked like Hideki Tojo.\n\nAnd if you reach Silent Knowledge daily and get good and causing the second attention fog to condense into \"magical objects\", you'll notice that what feels like \"ordinary\" things, such as squinting or turning the head sideways to get some odd blood flow, does in fact trigger real magic.\n\nIt's not as bad as pressing on your eyeballs gently, to leave an after image.\n\nBut if feels close to that.\n\nExcept that once you do whatever helps to get some magical thing to appear, the next time you don't have to do that.\n\nJust expect the magical thing to appear.\n\nIn some ways, that's a large part of how Tensegrity works.\n\nUsing the body, to generate magical effects.\n\nSo you can gaze at those and move your assemblage point.\n\nSo I'd say, blinking is fine.\n\nMight even be a useful technique if you can cause magic to show up by gazing outdoors, and notice that blinking can help at times.\n\nOr squinting, or \"pandiculating\".\n\n(stretching at weird but pleasant angles the way cats do).\n\nHere's a clue on part of how Cholita spells work. She took the energy of the plants already there, and channeled it down intending some she had preserved in her garden (some weeds she selected), should grow far faster.\n\nI wish I'd snapped a picture before that happened because it's astonishing magic, but I can't prove it. I only got a picture AFTER her spell.\n\nBut you can see that she painted the wall. And that's only part of where she drew \"growth\" down from the other yards next to ours.\n\nA lot of her spells are painting spells, since she restores art.  I guess taking a 400 year old painting and making it look new again, is sort of like a form of magic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ynidx85zflsb1.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50085ed6abf5d719560bd3cc76037a7b354b8db7", "edited": 1696603393.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_k3pzqdo", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid I don&amp;#39;t do that much lately.

So for the first time I could go see how she managed that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s more elaborate than I thought, and I still can&amp;#39;t possibly explain how she created it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She even painted flowers to match what was naturally there coming over the wall, encouraging the plants to grow what must be 2 weeks in just 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the idea to sit in it, and try to figure out what the cat perceives if it goes into there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if Cholita caught me, I&amp;#39;d be in big trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It might even turn out to be a trap of some kind, both for cats and for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I suppose, in your case don&amp;#39;t even think about blinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider that don Juan even made faces, including squinty eyes, when he was doing some magic for Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as reaching up into the air, to pull out a rabbit that looked like Hideki Tojo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you reach Silent Knowledge daily and get good and causing the second attention fog to condense into &amp;quot;magical objects&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;ll notice that what feels like &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; things, such as squinting or turning the head sideways to get some odd blood flow, does in fact trigger real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not as bad as pressing on your eyeballs gently, to leave an after image.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if feels close to that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that once you do whatever helps to get some magical thing to appear, the next time you don&amp;#39;t have to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just expect the magical thing to appear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In some ways, that&amp;#39;s a large part of how Tensegrity works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using the body, to generate magical effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can gaze at those and move your assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;d say, blinking is fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might even be a useful technique if you can cause magic to show up by gazing outdoors, and notice that blinking can help at times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or squinting, or &amp;quot;pandiculating&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(stretching at weird but pleasant angles the way cats do).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a clue on part of how Cholita spells work. She took the energy of the plants already there, and channeled it down intending some she had preserved in her garden (some weeds she selected), should grow far faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I&amp;#39;d snapped a picture before that happened because it&amp;#39;s astonishing magic, but I can&amp;#39;t prove it. I only got a picture AFTER her spell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can see that she painted the wall. And that&amp;#39;s only part of where she drew &amp;quot;growth&amp;quot; down from the other yards next to ours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of her spells are painting spells, since she restores art.

systems.\n\nCarlos used to look at his palm, or above a student in the air and slightly to their left, and just read what materialized.\n\nThat's how he \"decided\" what was best to say or do.\n\nHe didn't!\n\nHe let magic provide that answer.\n\nLike in the Silent Knowledge video.\n\nKeep in mind, sorcery CANNOT BE TAUGHT.\n\nTo adults that is.\n\nIt never has been!\n\nPeople find that point difficult to understand, but consider that the only form of real magic we've discovered on the internet, is ours.\n\nThere's a couple of Buddhists who can do beginners level stuff, the same as what we do at the beginner level.\n\nBut you're supposed to grow out of that in 2 weeks or so.\n\nThey've been stuck at beginner's level for years, because Buddhism is really lame.\n\nSo as far as teaching, there's only two situations we know of where anyone ever succeeded in teaching another person.\n\nThousands of  years ago, the old Olmec magicians were given very young children to teach.\n\nNow THAT can work!\n\nBut by young, we're talking 3-5 years old I suspect.\n\nAnd that society was invaded by neighboring Indian tribes, as populations grew and agriculture created people who don't have to search for food all the time.\n\nThey were dispersed from that situation by invaders.\n\nI believe two more times they found a new place to settle, and it was destroyed.\n\nThe last time being the Toltec empire.\n\nAfter that, they no longer had any way to teach by the original methods.\n\nThey didn't have a fairly stable population and existence, where they were given very young children to become their apprentices.\n\nSo they hid in \"lineages\" of around 15.\n\nAnd now they had to teach adults.\n\nIn order to replace themselves, or else that magic would be lost.\n\nBut you can't teach an adult!\n\nAt least, only 1 in 500 who start off in the first place saying they are interested, will ultimately succeed.\n\nWe've seen that in here!\n\nNot good enough for a need to \"replace\" yourself in the short time we live.\n\nSo they started waiting for \"the spirit\" to bring them apprentices.  To point out to them, who could learn.\n\nFor example, they'd notice that the washer woman down the street is about to die soon.  Using their ability to see into the future a bit.\n\nAnd then notice, a little circle of moths is flying over her head as if the insects haven't given up on her yet.\n\nSo they took only those \"indicated by the spirit\" to teach.\n\nBut even then it took 15 sorcerers just to surround them in a bubble of magic, figure out what their specific needs were and  pair them off with the right sorcerer from their group, so that they had a chance to teach them.\n\nCarlos did something similar, in that Jadey was given to her \"type\", Taisha, and Cholita was given to her \"type\", Florinda.\n\nStalkers and dreamers.\n\nBut NOW, we don't have either.  No young children to teach, and no ability to use a group of 15, to teach those the spirit indicates to us.\n\nYou have to teach yourself.\n\nStill, if you ask specific questions there's dozens in here who can answer them correctly.\n\nYou can't say that about any other place on the internet.\n\nThat you'll get good answers, for how to learn real magic.", "edited": 1696532316.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_k3m36c1", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t really know what&amp;#39;s better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in fact, it&amp;#39;s likely by individual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not by a &amp;quot;grand design&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grand designs are for thieves, stealing money with fake magical systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos used to look at his palm, or above a student in the air and slightly to their left, and just read what materialized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how he &amp;quot;decided&amp;quot; what was best to say or do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He let magic provide that answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like in the Silent Knowledge video.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, sorcery CANNOT BE TAUGHT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To adults that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It never has been!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People find that point difficult to understand, but consider that the only form of real magic we&amp;#39;ve discovered on the internet, is ours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a couple of Buddhists who can do beginners level stuff, the same as what we do at the beginner level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;re supposed to grow out of that in 2 weeks or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve been stuck at beginner&amp;#39;s level for years, because Buddhism is really lame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as far as teaching, there&amp;#39;s only two situations we know of where anyone ever succeeded in teaching another person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thousands of  years ago, the old Olmec magicians were given very young children to teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now THAT can work!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But by young, we&amp;#39;re talking 3-5 years old I suspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that society was invaded by neighboring Indian tribes, as populations grew and agriculture created people who don&amp;#39;t have to search for food all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were dispersed from that situation by invaders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe two more times they found a new place to settle, and it was destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last time being the Toltec empire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, they no longer had any way to teach by the original methods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t have a fairly stable population and existence, where they were given very young children to become their apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they hid in &amp;quot;lineages&amp;quot; of around 15.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now they had to teach adults.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to replace themselves, or else that magic would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t teach an adult!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, only 1 in 500 who start off in the first place saying they are interested, will ultimately succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve seen that in here!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not good enough for a need to &amp;quot;replace&amp;quot; yourself in the short time we live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they started waiting for &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot; to bring them apprentices.

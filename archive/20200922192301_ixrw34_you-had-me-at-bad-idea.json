I have read all the Carlos Castaneda books, except for Magical Passes years ago. I even read the two apprentice books and some of the fake apprentices like Ken E F and that horrible book by Marylin Tumenshade (not sure if that\u2019s her name).  I wish I could bleach my brain after that one. I skipped the Tesengrity stuff as I bought into the hype that it was something Carlos just made up. \n\nWhile still needing to catch up on data mining this forum, I\u2019d like to post my game plan and ask a few questions. It goes a little something like this:\n\nDaily Practice\n\n2 Hours of Recapitulation. Already doing this in a free form no list manner. Works for me.\n\n15 to 30 minutes of Magical Passes, to be determined.\n\nGeneric Silence as much as possible each day.\n\n2 hours darkwork. I got a nice dark bathroom where I do the recap but prefer my bedroom with the blackout curtains because a little light actually helps.\n\nStaying away from the books except for that 59 page guide that I learned about from you guys.\n\nI already see colors so I\u2019m going for the wall as the first goal/intent. This is all the time I can commit to right now.\n\nNow the questions:\n\nWhat is the \u201cminimum effective dose\u201d for magical passes? In other words are there precise passes that work best for Waking Dreaming?

I did not know that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My ex-wife/best friend had the Ruthless quote on the Fridge:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be ruthless but charming&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be cunning but nice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be patient but active&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be sweet but lethal&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do have the strings on my stomach, big time. Is there a specific way to get rid of them? They get yanked all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is an update to my darkroom work. I realized that I have been seeing the wall for a day or two but did not realize it. Two nights ago when I woke up to go to the bathroom, I would notice a bluish grey tinge to the bathroom wall that looked like it had lines and lines of text that I could not really make out. At the time I thought it was some visual feedback from staring at my iPad all day. Then it happened a second night, \u201chow odd, is this a thing now?\u201d, but no connection. This morning I was pondering how weird that was and visualized what I had seen. Then my focus changed and It looked like a blue grey stucco or adobe textured wall and the textlines looked like grooved lines. Once it dawned on me, \u201cThat\u2019s the fucking wall!\u201d Now that I\u2019ve seen it, I can&amp;#39;t unsee it. Maybe I\u2019m imagining it all, but this really is fun, no matter what it is or isn\u2019t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ixrw34/you_had_me_at_bad_idea/g69cgrg/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_g69cgrg", "created": 1600812532.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1600812532.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g68ldyr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1600798984.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ixrw34", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "We're doing so well in here, we're going for 24 now!\n\nAutism can be an advantage, because we obsess over things and want to learn everything about them.

Try going longer.\n\nAs you know, whatever the origin of the dialogue actually is, one of the effects of stopping it even for a brief moment, is that when it comes back, it stops being as nasty as it was in fear that you will stop it again. I find that it gets all nice and tells you better stuff. And then there is the rare occasion that you stop it long enough that the actual voice of truth kicks in and replaces it entirely for a while.

The foggy light is bright enough even with the mask, I enjoy walking around with them lighting the way. I\u2019m up to a full 3 hours in the dark nightly, yet the recap stopped as there is much to unpack, as my past is something I\u2019d rather forget. Yet I know it needs to be done so I try to do as  much as I can, only 20 minutes at a time and hope to build up from there. \n\nThe minimum effective dose question (poorly worded as I was trying to be hip) is also what passes should I do? After seeing all the Tensegrity videos on the YouTube (shout out to Star Dot Technologies) the one that most grabbed me was a short 5 minute clip of \u201cThe Wheel of Time\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s the one I\u2019d start with but am open to suggestions. Pandora\u2019s Box and Zulicia\u2019s pass were also mentioned on this site as possibilities.\n\nThere are two things going on that I don\u2019t understand. I found myself talking to a blob of yellowish light the size and shape of one of those inflatable exercise balls. The energy from it is warm, caring, loving even. I did not see that one coming. I was expecting a red and black spinning diamond that would grab my stomach strings saying \u201cHow about a little taste of HELL!!\u201d. First time I saw it, it calmed me down as I get scared occasionally (alot) doing this. I thought I was imagining it. Second time, I was doing sort of a chakra meditation and it was giving me pointers about physical energy blocks. Ok. So last night when I saw it again I asked what it was. It said that I had requested a teacher during my microdose. That\u2019s sort of true, My actual request was for a phone number/energy signature so I could get in contact with a teacher without being high. The reply was \u201c555-Reishi\u201d which I immediately translated into \u201cyou need to megadose reishi for a few weeks as it is a more appropriate teacher than psychedelic mushrooms\u201d. Through the magic of Amazon, a day later, I got Reishi mushroom spore oil caps and have been chugging them ever since. It went on \u201csaying\u201d that it wanted to teach me two things. Thing one, how not to be a miserable human being. That was two fold meaning as 1: being miserable personally and 2: (This is more complicated and something that was discussed during the microdose) Humanity, in general, is a miserable lot. I got a species perspective, like a view from the fungi kingdom, animal kingdom, plant kingdom, that they think we suck. They would love for us to get some unity consciousness, get a clue, so to speak. If that wasn\u2019t enough, Thing 2. This was more sorcery related. They want to teach me how to switch back and forth with my double. Not quite sure what that means as I read all the books many times, but like 20 years ago. And I\u2019m loath to research the books because it will turn into a mental process, an inventory. My recollection was, that is what Don Genaro did. We shall see. Finally I asked it if it was an imaginary creature. Reply was \u201cOf course, are you?\u201d. I dodged the question saying, \u201cShould I call you Master Reishi?\u201d Reply, \u201cYou can do better than that\u201d. This is classic, \u201cDid the coyote really speak\u201d territory, I know. But then again, in \u201creal\u201d life I often talk to my cat, the trees, my car, the TV, myself, Mt. Rainier, so this really isn\u2019t a stretch at all.\n\nBut that's not even the weird part. The next day I woke up, was doing breakfast and after 10 minutes I realized my inner dialogue had stopped. On realizing it, I thought it would start back immediately, but it took awhile. My current normal silence ability is a few minutes, some thought, a few minutes silence, thought etc, done for an hour or two.\n\nSorry for the elaborate build up, but here is the question. Was that heightened awareness? I was going to ask Dan, but then saw your reply and figured, \u201chey, he is smart, too\u201d. \n\nI have a big ask of you and Dan. Could I have permission to ask an occasional question and give an occasional update as to my progress as a reply to one of your posts? Kinda like what I just did here?  I\u2019m a lurker by nature and really hate writing on the internet at all. I haven\u2019t posted anywhere in the last 10 or so years.  I want to be one of the 26+ waking dreamers being trained here but need to maintain a low profile. Yesterday, I unloaded on a fellow poster (he had it coming!) and that\u2019s not the man I want to be. I\u2019m not above having my chain yanked/strings pulled, and am aware that it\u2019s victim consciousness that\u2019s the root of it. And I\u2019m working on it. Awareness is always the first step.  I\u2019ve got enough on my plate learning sorcery without also having to struggle with my autistic difficulty with social media skills. Playing the disability card, that\u2019s pretty damn low. Did it work?\n\nThanks for listening! \n\nHope we can do business.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the useful input. You are greatly appreciated. I\u2019ve read many of your postings and know you know what you are talking about. So much so that I\u2019d like to run some stuff by you. Feel free to respond or not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After doing Darkroom for a few nights now, things are changing. I switched to a Sleep mask so I can move about my apartment freely. The foggy light is bright enough even with the mask, I enjoy walking around with them lighting the way. I\u2019m up to a full 3 hours in the dark nightly, yet the recap stopped as there is much to unpack, as my past is something I\u2019d rather forget. Yet I know it needs to be done so I try to do as  much as I can, only 20 minutes at a time and hope to build up from there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The minimum effective dose question (poorly worded as I was trying to be hip) is also what passes should I do?

Here's the precise inspirational quote that proves that:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nDon Juan listened in silence as I described to him my predicament. I could not discard or explain away my urge to go to the inorganic beings' world, in spite of what I knew about it.\n\n\"I have a streak of insanity,\" I said. \"What I do doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\"It does make sense. The inorganic beings are still reeling you in, like a fish hooked at the end of a line,\" he said. \"They throw worthless bait at you from time to time to keep you going. To arrange your dreams to occur every four days without fail is worthless bait. But they didn't teach you how to move your energy body.\"\n\n\"Why do you think they didn't?\"\n\n\"Because when your energy body learns to move by itself, you'll be thoroughly out of their reach. It was premature of me to believe that you are free from them. You are relatively but not completely free. They are still bidding for your awareness.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut why do they show up in the first place, and can we expect everyone who becomes a puff of light scooper, to encounter them?\n\nI believe so.    I always thought you released new energy when the assemblage point moved, and based on watching the reaction of Fairy, that it pleased them.\n\nYou can actually see them fly over in response to something new you are doing, even if you had forgotten about their presence.\n\nSo here's an inspirational quote to back up that idea:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe difficulty with inorganic beings is that their awareness is very slow in comparison with ours. It will take years for a sorcerer to be acknowledged by inorganic beings.\n\nSo, it is advisable to have patience and wait. Sooner or later they show up. But not like you or I would show up. Theirs is a most peculiar way to make themselves known.\"\n\n\"How do sorcerers entice them? Do they have a ritual?\"\n\n\"Well, they certainly don't stand in the middle of the road and call out to them with trembling voices at the stroke of midnight, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"What do they do then?\"\n\n\"They entice them in dreaming. I said that what's involved is more than enticing them; by the act of dreaming, sorcerers compel those beings to interact with them.\"\n\n\"How do sorcerers compel them by the act of dreaming?\"\n\n\"Dreaming is sustaining the position where the assemblage point has shifted in dreams. This act creates a distinctive energy charge, which attracts their attention. It's like bait to fish; they'll go for it. Sorcerers, by reaching and crossing the first two gates of dreaming, set bait for those beings and compel them to appear.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo by using waking dreaming, you'll actually be in control of luring them to you.\n\nSustaining the position of the assemblage point in dreams is not nearly as straight forward as sustaining it while awake, and watching \"impossible\" things materialize in the dark.\n\nYou're fully rational for one thing. In lucid dreaming, you may be lucid but  you're a drunken idiot.\n\nYou can be lucid, walking along with your \"dog\", and realize it's a pig.  And then just ignore that, and go on being, \"lucid\".\n\nBut if you are awake, and suddenly Fairy has a pig's head, you just aren't going to overlook that detail.\n\nYou'll do something about it.\n\nI believe we can conclude, it's inevitable that if you scoop colors you'll get your own IOB!\n\nAnd faster than with 4 gates dreaming.\n\nAlso, long before you stop the world.\n\n(The bottom most level of silence).\n\nBut there's danger in meeting them, according to don Juan.\n\nMyself, I don't believe it. Which is probably why, when faced with a giant demon about to bite my head off, I have no reaction.\n\nI don't really believe it.\n\nBut here's the danger in this inspirational quote.   Notice that scooping colors in darkness is not the same as this technique.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHe said that ancient seers were damaged by their aberrant insistence on staying glued to their procedures, but that whatever they found was valid. They found out that the surest way to meet one of those creatures is through a body of water. The size of the body of water is not relevant; an ocean or a pond serves the same purpose. He had chosen a small stream because he hated to get wet. We could have gotten the same results in a lake or a large river.\n\n\"The other life comes to find out what's going on when human beings call,\" he continued. \"That Toltec technique is like a knock on their door. The old seers said the shiny surface on the bottom of the water served as a bait and a window. So humans and those creatures meet at a window.\"\n\n\"Is that what happened to me there?\" I asked.\n\n\"The old seers would've said that you were being pulled by the power of the water and the power of the first level, plus the magnetic influence of the creature at the window.\"\n\n\"But I heard a voice in my ear saying that I was dying,\" I said.\n\n\"The voice was right. You were dying, and you would have if I hadn't been there. That is the danger of practicing the Toltecs' techniques. They are extremely effective but most of the time they are deadly.\"\n\nEdited\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Who gifts Whom?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_i3m7lg", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1596563109.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1596557660.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone pointed out to me that the inorganic beings can &amp;quot;lure&amp;quot; you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That didn&amp;#39;t seem quite right to me, probably because I&amp;#39;m more on their side, than on the side of people who think they&amp;#39;re dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ve been giving &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; credit for any gifting I&amp;#39;ve received.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides, Fairy would never &amp;quot;lure&amp;quot; me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would she?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out I was wrong.

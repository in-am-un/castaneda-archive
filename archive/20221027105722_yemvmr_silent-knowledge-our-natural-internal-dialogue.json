The reason ought to become obvious as you read this.  If it doesn't, go back and read as many older posts in here as you can, until it does.  And pay attention to the visitors who attempt to pretend instead of learn.\n\nIt's important to know the \"why\" when you practice, especially with all the hard effort that will go into it.\n\nI started practicing tonight with the advantage of being able to reach the state of silent knowledge in around 30 minutes.  It used to take 2 or 3 hours.  I believe one of the witches commented she could do it in 6 minutes, and Carlos 8 seconds.\n\nArriving there in 30 minutes sort of turbocharges the sights you see doing tensegrity in darkness. Because it corresponds to the length of time it takes, to do the series of forms.\n\nYes, there's puffs.  And flashes, and sparkles.  And a pinkish fog fills the air.\n\nBut silent knowledge is beyond that.  All the sights you see, along with others you can't until you get close to that state, come with \"meaning\".\n\nYou just \"know\" what they mean.\n\nBut don't let that divert you into pretending. It's very common in the Castaneda community for some random man who teaches Tai Chi (badly), to claim he can \"see\".\n\nBefore he has any idea at all what that means.\n\nHe's just made up his own idea of what it is, which probably is a little like \"intuition\".\n\nBut in fact, that's NOT *seeing*.\n\n*Seeing* happens when your attention moves away from fantasizing and focusing on your memories of the past, and all the feelings you had about that.  And instead you focus on the emanations themselves.\n\nConsider that as your internal dialogue rages on, you fantasize about the memories it represents.\n\nYou remember the time you were falsely accused of something.  That's just the flicker of a feeling inside.  It bubbles to the surface, you feel the grief of being wronged, and then the images of that event become known to you.\n\nFor some, almost visibly.   But for most there's no actual daydream scene.  You just \"know\", because you remember.\n\nAnd your internal dialogue flows from one to the other, never ceasing. Causing your awareness to be lost in past events.  In a sea of self-pity.\n\nIt's understandable.  We're born into flesh bodies with real needs, and an imperative to work to get food, mates, social standing for our own safety.  Even as babies we realize our brother got 2 cookies, and we only got 1.  We develop an image in our mind of a copy of our \"self\", and then appraise it to see if it's been threatened.\n\nWe must protect the flesh body, and that gives rise to obsession over current events and how they relate to past events.\n\nWhile fantasizing about such things we pull up the memories we have, and we just \"know\" the circumstances.  Even down to small details such as what color someone was wearing when they wronged you.  Or where you were, or what happened before that.\n\nThere's an odd \"other side\" to that, which lucid dreamers will discover.  The same sort of thing goes on in dreams, except that the dreamer, our double, doesn't have to care about physical things.  He's free from worry about getting his fair share of food.  His concerns are freed from the physical, and so he can just go with the dream and \"know\" the history of that place.\n\nBut also the history of the next he dreams about.   Wherever he goes, he just \"knows\" the general details of the new reality he's inside.\n\nCarlos used to tout \"dead dreaming\", where the concerns of the double are even further reduced so that he's already lost everything that matters to his waking self. That allows a bit of that part of him to join in with free roaming without worry and grief.  It's a form of stable lucidity.\n\nIn some ways you could say that \"The Eagle\" drives us to all this madness.  We're probes for some superconsciousness, arising from a dark sea of emanations. Fibers of light sort of like \"superstrings\", which give off a tiny feeling.  Each feeling unique, but so tiny you couldn't really even describe it.\n\nYet together as \"bundles\", they make our perceptual reality.  Our awareness, the only thing we really have, goes out into the emanations, and the ones it lights up with awareness send their tiny feelings back. We interpret the zillions of them doing that as \"reality\".\n\nThe Eagle, that which seers once saw to represent the unknowable superconsciousness which arises from the entire sea of emanations, wants more than anything to know how it feels to swim in those dark waters.\n\nHe compels us to look around, periodically issuing a command for us to \"take an inventory\".\n\nSo we're rather forced to let our awareness flow into the emanations.  But because everything we can possibly see, do, or even think about comes from those emanations and only seems to be a larger \"thing\" because  of bundling of vast numbers of those tiny feeling emitting emanations, it seems as if your awareness flows from topic to topic. Or thing to thing.\n\nAnd our obsession over being wronged in the things we remember, is also possibly a side effect of \"The Tyrant\".  \n\nThat's what sorcerers nicknamed the eagle. \n\nBy comparison to the source of all things, any other tyrants in your life are merely \"petty tyrants\".\n\nBut our flow of awareness has been corrupted.  No one knows by what.  It's missing the ability to focus on emanations outside a very narrow range. We call that the \"blue line\" on the J curve.\n\nAt that level awareness can only follow into the mundane. Into a very specific range of memories of things that only serve to reinforce the point of view that we are victims.\n\nAt the opposite end of that on the J curve, in Silent Knowledge, we are able to focus on all we could ever be.  It's all available there, because the awareness flows into all levels of reality possible for us to perceive.  Even the non-human.\n\nAs Carlos has explained, there are 600 more copies of ourselves, living in completely different worlds.  And yet, all right here.\n\nAdd to that 10,000 phantom permutations of your current situation, reached by horizontal shifts of the assemblage point, and reality for us is VAST.\n\nAnd yet, not even a fraction of what's available if we can retain our awareness on death, and keep it beyond our physical body.  At that point the entire dark sea becomes available.  Not just the range we were created to explore.\n\nWe're probes for the Eagle, and he creates us as a tiny bubble on a specific range of emanations.\n\nJust now I was doing my series of tensegrity forms, which I designed to explore phantom room creation.\n\nOne of the things you discover doing dark room, is that the walls of the room can begin to show a whitish light, and  that light can gain texture, and entire alien vistas can become visible on the walls.\n\nSorcerers go much further and even create phantom copies of their home.\n\nI wanted to learn how to do that on demand.\n\nMy series of forms is designed to end with the perfect formation of a specific phantom room.\n\nAs I did the series of forms I could see the results gradually building up to that.  The floor became visible as yellow flashes and vague lines of light, my body seemed to become visible as whitish weird wavy forms, and I even had visitors.\n\nMy Allies Mystery and Fancy showed up.\n\nI was surrounded by puffs and swirls and floors that looked real, with walls that seemed to have shelves.  Yet all visible in absolute darkness.\n\nIt built up faster,  if I followed my \"ritual\" more perfectly.\n\n\"Fancy\" began to clarify what I was seeing, commenting on it as I went along.\n\nShe said, \"You know the men of knowledge did the same thing?  They never learned to perceive the emanations directly, and so they never learned to 'see', but they were fully capable of causing cool sights to appear by following precise rituals involving their actions, an ally, and some power plants to move their assemblage point.\"\n\nShe continued, \"But not random drug trips. Those are just a deep movement of the assemblage point to the red zone.  Then it's all just random images.  The Men of Knowledge actually managed to get an Ally to help them, by giving them an indirect view of all the emanations in Man's band of awareness.\n\nExactly what seers do!  But the Men of Knowledge, incapable of moving their assemblage points far enough to perceive it directly, used a ritual to induce their Ally to bring them what they could not reach themselves.\n\nThat's exactly what you're doing right now with your series of Tensegrity forms.\n\nExcept that as a 'seer', you get to watch how the process actually works!\"\n\nShe was right, I could see it.  I couldn't explain it, but I'd been doing the precise \"ritual\" so long it was almost like driving home through the scenic part of your city, knowing the sights just around the corner.\n\nThe road with the amazing palm trees lining it.  That guaranteed that when you turned right, the old Ice House would be visible. And the huge water tank on the low hill to the left.\n\nAll beautiful and familiar and part of a larger whole.  Your cozy hometown.\n\nThe same happens when you use a series of Tensegrity forms to produce a result.\n\nYou in effect do what the men of knowledge could not.  Create  any ritual you like to do anything at all.\n\nThey only had a few handed down to them over thousands of years. Creating new rituals was mostly beyond their abilities.\n\nWhen I finished my series of forms, I stood in the exact same spot in my darkroom and glanced out at the result.\n\nIt was fairly well formed.  I had even seen inside the \"lost and found\" cabinet in the north east corner of the phantom room. I didn't get a clear view of the curiosities inside it, but at least I could find the doorknobs and see the doors swing  as I pulled them. I carefully closed it again out of respect for the \"reality\" of that place.\n\nI went to drink water, sitting on pillows, and gazed into the darkness. I could now see the emanations themselves.   Not in their purest form. But in highly textured whitish light on all surfaces, which had moved out to fill the air.\n\nI was looking at the emanations in Man's band of awareness. That's what Silent Knowledge is.\n\nI gazed from one \"disturbance\" to the other, to see what it would reveal. What I would \"know\" about it?\n\nFancy commented, \"Strange, isn't it?\n\nYou didn't change at all.  You started off stuck in endless recounting of all the events of your past.  Your awareness flowing non-stop, from one memory to the other.\n\nBut now you're doing the same.  Your awareness is flowing from one disturbance in the force of the emanations, to the other. And each one can summon a visible dream bubble of that event.\n\nIt's more vivid than the internal dialogue, but essentially the same.\n\nIt's the natural internal dialogue of humans.  As we grow and mature our ability to seek out useful things is enhanced.  And so we evolve to be more powerful.\n\nBut it's still the same thing 'beings' always do.  The Eagle commands it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Silent Knowledge: Our Natural Internal Dialogue", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 109, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"48yl8hmt8bw91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 84, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/48yl8hmt8bw91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdb4b2fe8d1067afd87d67a13a186de718d0af98"}, {"y": 168, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/48yl8hmt8bw91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1590976f29ee869d9c387a902c763959c7872ba"}, {"y": 249, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/48yl8hmt8bw91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ec91219d47365e9dcd74089822d2b4ad36e0b8b"}, {"y": 498, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/48yl8hmt8bw91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d67a5fb81e101763cc25385a8c5b65ca2f00b66d"}, {"y": 748, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/48yl8hmt8bw91.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f51c62851165d5c6c1dc9b6323c4d15bda9a7d3"}, {"y": 841, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/48yl8hmt8bw91.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4964d7958219b494f75c7f695ee039d9c7be6686"}], "s": {"y": 848, "x": 1088, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/48yl8hmt8bw91.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e357bbc0f938ef87a9aedec024060eee33c8ae19"}, "id": "48yl8hmt8bw91"}}, "name": "t3_yemvmr", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 47, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 47, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gmKY1UuNHp1ljHAToKXGYsFLX8LbsNe3uFiazcYGa5s.jpg", "edited": 1666862380.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1666861042.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/48yl8hmt8bw91.png?width=1088&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e357bbc0f938ef87a9aedec024060eee33c8ae19\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/48yl8hmt8bw91.png?width=1088&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e357bbc0f938ef87a9aedec024060eee33c8ae19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is quite a bit advanced, and yet it&amp;#39;s the simplest thing in all of sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the state all of you will arrive at, if you make the effort and never give up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you try to pretend any aspect of it, you&amp;#39;ll fail.

Create  any ritual you like to do anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They only had a few handed down to them over thousands of years. Creating new rituals was mostly beyond their abilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I finished my series of forms, I stood in the exact same spot in my darkroom and glanced out at the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was fairly well formed.  I had even seen inside the &amp;quot;lost and found&amp;quot; cabinet in the north east corner of the phantom room. I didn&amp;#39;t get a clear view of the curiosities inside it, but at least I could find the doorknobs and see the doors swing  as I pulled them. I carefully closed it again out of respect for the &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot; of that place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to drink water, sitting on pillows, and gazed into the darkness. I could now see the emanations themselves.   Not in their purest form. But in highly textured whitish light on all surfaces, which had moved out to fill the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was looking at the emanations in Man&amp;#39;s band of awareness. That&amp;#39;s what Silent Knowledge is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gazed from one &amp;quot;disturbance&amp;quot; to the other, to see what it would reveal. What I would &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; about it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy commented, &amp;quot;Strange, isn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You didn&amp;#39;t change at all.  You started off stuck in endless recounting of all the events of your past.  Your awareness flowing non-stop, from one memory to the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now you&amp;#39;re doing the same.  Your awareness is flowing from one disturbance in the force of the emanations, to the other. And each one can summon a visible dream bubble of that event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s more vivid than the internal dialogue, but essentially the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the natural internal dialogue of humans.  As we grow and mature our ability to seek out useful things is enhanced.  And so we evolve to be more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s still the same thing &amp;#39;beings&amp;#39; always do.  The Eagle commands it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e6deba4-a617-11ec-90b9-2a099f759379", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "yemvmr", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 22, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yemvmr/silent_knowledge_our_natural_internal_dialogue/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/yemvmr/silent_knowledge_our_natural_internal_dialogue/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1666861042.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iu9i4zf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iu9f880", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I had to give up private chats.

Keep in mind, Carlos was nicknamed \"The Maestro\".\n\nI suppose it's like \"Sifu\"?  \n\nI keep thinking band leader, but perhaps that's also appropriate.\n\nThis is likely from Second ring of Power, but could be Eagle's Gift.\n\nIt's \"after the blowup\".  A nagual leader \"blows up\" his lineage when he leaves, causing everyone to scatter and become angry.\n\nWe're feeling the after effects of that ourselves, and trying to restore the group as much as we can.\n\nSadly, we only managed to salvage 3 from his private classes and inner circle.\n\nThe point of the blow up is to give everyone a real \"choice\".  \n\nIn the lineages, people were pretty much tricked into learning magic.\n\nBut this extended even to us, the volunteers, because Carlos set it up to happen again.\n\nGoaded Amy, and manipulated opinion to make it inevitable.\n\nFrankly it was masterful.  \n\nBut that \"blow up\" had to extend even to his book reader audience, and thus his reputation was also 'blown up\".\n\nI suppose, that's a good thing.  More connection to the *intent* of our lineages.\n\nAs for the dome \"container\", you can also find containers of other sorts.\n\nInhabit someone else.\n\nGo to the inorganic being's world.\n\nTurn yourself into a tree.\n\nAnd there's even another way that Carlos didn't explain to us. Which leads to immortality.\n\nBut the dome was the preferred choice of container for the \"new seers\".\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"Why do you talk like that. Maestro?\" Nestor asked with a tone of deep concern. \"Not even Pablito talks like that.\"\r  \n\r  \nI thought Pablito was going to protest. He almost stood up, but he seemed to change his mind.\r  \n\r  \n\"Yes, that's right,\" he said. \"Not even I talk like that.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Well, if Eligio didn't die, where is he?\" I asked.\r  \n\r  \n\"Soledad already told you,\" Nestor said softly. \"Eligio went to join the Nagual and Genaro.\"\r  \n\r  \nI decided that it was best not to ask any more questions. I did not mean my probes to be aggressive, but they always turned out that way. Besides, I had the feeling that they did not know much more than I did.\r  \n\r  \nNestor suddenly stood up and began to pace back and forth in front of me. Finally he pulled me away from the table by my armpits. He did not want me to write. He asked me if I had really blacked out like Pablito had at the moment of jumping and did not remember anything. I told him that I had had a number of vivid dreams or visions that I could not explain and that I had come to see them to seek clarification. They wanted to hear about all the visions I had had.\r  \n\r  \nAfter they had heard my accounts, Nestor said that my visions were of a bizarre order and only the first two were of great importance and of this earth. The rest were visions of alien worlds. He explained that my first vision was of special value because it was an omen proper. He said that sorcerers always took a first event of any series as the blueprint or the map of what was going to develop subsequently.\r  \n\r  \nIn that particular vision I had found myself looking at an outlandish world. There was an enormous rock right in front of my eyes, a rock which had been split in two. Through a wide gap in it I could see a boundless phosphorescent plain, a valley of some sort, which was bathed in a greenish-yellow light.\r  \n\r  \nOn one side of the valley, to the right, and partially covered from my view by the enormous rock, there was an unbelievable domelike structure. It was dark, almost a charcoal gray. If my size was what it is in the world of everyday life, the dome must have been fifty thousand feet high and miles and miles across. Such an enormity dazzled me. I had a sensation of vertigo and plummeted into a state of disintegration.\r  \n\r  \nOnce more I rebounded from it and found myself on a very uneven and yet flat surface. It was a shiny, interminable surface just like the plain I had seen before. It went as far as I could see. I soon realized that I could turn my head in any direction I wanted on a horizontal plane, but I could not look at myself. I was able, however, to examine the surroundings by rotating my head from left to right and vice versa. Nevertheless, when I wanted to turn around to look behind me, I could not move my bulk.\r  \n\r  \nThe plain extended itself monotonously, equally to my left and to my right. There was nothing else in sight but an endless, whitish glare. I wanted to look at the ground underneath my feet but my eyes could not move down. I lifted my head up to look at the sky. All I saw was another limitless, whitish surface that seemed to be connected to the one I was standing on. I then had a moment of apprehension and felt that something was just about to be revealed to me. But the sudden and devastating jolt of disintegration stopped my revelation. Some force pulled me downward.

A nagual leader &amp;quot;blows up&amp;quot; his lineage when he leaves, causing everyone to scatter and become angry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re feeling the after effects of that ourselves, and trying to restore the group as much as we can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, we only managed to salvage 3 from his private classes and inner circle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point of the blow up is to give everyone a real &amp;quot;choice&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the lineages, people were pretty much tricked into learning magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this extended even to us, the volunteers, because Carlos set it up to happen again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Goaded Amy, and manipulated opinion to make it inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly it was masterful.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that &amp;quot;blow up&amp;quot; had to extend even to his book reader audience, and thus his reputation was also &amp;#39;blown up&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose, that&amp;#39;s a good thing.  More connection to the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of our lineages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the dome &amp;quot;container&amp;quot;, you can also find containers of other sorts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inhabit someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to the inorganic being&amp;#39;s world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turn yourself into a tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s even another way that Carlos didn&amp;#39;t explain to us. Which leads to immortality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the dome was the preferred choice of container for the &amp;quot;new seers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why do you talk like that. Maestro?&amp;quot; Nestor asked with a tone of deep concern. &amp;quot;Not even Pablito talks like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought Pablito was going to protest. He almost stood up, but he seemed to change his mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, that&amp;#39;s right,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Not even I talk like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, if Eligio didn&amp;#39;t die, where is he?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Soledad already told you,&amp;quot; Nestor said softly. &amp;quot;Eligio went to join the Nagual and Genaro.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided that it was best not to ask any more questions. I did not mean my probes to be aggressive, but they always turned out that way. Besides, I had the feeling that they did not know much more than I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nestor suddenly stood up and began to pace back and forth in front of me. Finally he pulled me away from the table by my armpits. He did not want me to write. He asked me if I had really blacked out like Pablito had at the moment of jumping and did not remember anything. I told him that I had had a number of vivid dreams or visions that I could not explain and that I had come to see them to seek clarification. They wanted to hear about all the visions I had had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After they had heard my accounts, Nestor said that my visions were of a bizarre order and only the first two were of great importance and of this earth. The rest were visions of alien worlds. He explained that my first vision was of special value because it was an omen proper. He said that sorcerers always took a first event of any series as the blueprint or the map of what was going to develop subsequently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that particular vision I had found myself looking at an outlandish world. There was an enormous rock right in front of my eyes, a rock which had been split in two. Through a wide gap in it I could see a boundless phosphorescent plain, a valley of some sort, which was bathed in a greenish-yellow light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On one side of the valley, to the right, and partially covered from my view by the enormous rock, there was an unbelievable domelike structure. It was dark, almost a charcoal gray. If my size was what it is in the world of everyday life, the dome must have been fifty thousand feet high and miles and miles across. Such an enormity dazzled me. I had a sensation of vertigo and plummeted into a state of disintegration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once more I rebounded from it and found myself on a very uneven and yet flat surface. It was a shiny, interminable surface just like the plain I had seen before. It went as far as I could see. I soon realized that I could turn my head in any direction I wanted on a horizontal plane, but I could not look at myself. I was able, however, to examine the surroundings by rotating my head from left to right and vice versa. Nevertheless, when I wanted to turn around to look behind me, I could not move my bulk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The plain extended itself monotonously, equally to my left and to my right. There was nothing else in sight but an endless, whitish glare. I wanted to look at the ground underneath my feet but my eyes could not move down. I lifted my head up to look at the sky. All I saw was another limitless, whitish surface that seemed to be connected to the one I was standing on. I then had a moment of apprehension and felt that something was just about to be revealed to me. But the sudden and devastating jolt of disintegration stopped my revelation. Some force pulled me downward. It was as if the whitish surface had swallowed me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nestor said that my vision of a dome was of tremendous importance because that particular shape had been isolated by the Nagual and Genaro as the vision of the place where all of us were supposed to meet them someday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_yemvmr", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yemvmr/silent_knowledge_our_natural_internal_dialogue/iudjrn0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1667141580.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1667141580.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iucmbi6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dorbim", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iu4i6ao", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_b5vqacf2", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Thank you!

Sorcerers claim that controlled folly is the only way they have of dealing with themselves- in their state of expanded awareness and perception- and with everybody and everything in the world of daily affairs.\"\n\nDon Juan had explained controlled folly as the art of controlled deception or the art of pretending to be thoroughly immersed in the action at hand- pretending so well no one could tell it from the real thing. Controlled folly is not an outright deception, he had told me, but a sophisticated, artistic way of being separated from everything while remaining an integral part of everything.\n\n\"Controlled folly is an art,\" don Juan continued. \"A very bothersome art, and a difficult one to learn. Many sorcerers don't have the stomach for it, not because there is anything inherently wrong with the art, but because it takes a lot of energy to exercise it.\"\n\nDon Juan admitted that he practiced it conscientiously, although he was not particularly fond of doing so; perhaps because his benefactor had been so adept at it. Or, perhaps it was because his personality- which he said was basically devious and petty- simply did not have the agility needed to practice controlled folly.\n\nI looked at him with surprise. He stopped talking and fixed me with his mischievous eyes.\n\n\"By the time we come to sorcery, our personality is already formed,\" he said, and shrugged his shoulders to signify resignation, \"and all we can do is practice controlled folly and laugh at ourselves.\"\n\nI had a surge of empathy and assured him that to me he was not in any way petty or devious.\n\n\"But that's my basic personality,\" he insisted.\n\nAnd I insisted that it was not.\n\n\"Stalkers who practice controlled folly believe that, in matters of personality, the entire human race falls into three categories,\" he said, and smiled the way he always did when he was setting me up.\n\n\"That's absurd,\" I protested. \"Human behavior is too complex to be categorized so simply.\"\n\n\"Stalkers say that we are not so complex as we think we are,\" he said, \"and that we all belong to one of three categories.\"\n\nI laughed out of nervousness. Ordinarily I would have taken such a statement as a joke, but this time, because my mind was extremely clear and my thoughts were poignant, I felt he was indeed serious.\n\n\"Are you serious?\" I asked, as politely as I could.\n\n\"Completely serious,\" he replied, and began to laugh.\n\nHis laughter relaxed me a little. And he continued explaining the stalkers' system of classification.\n\nHe said that people in the first class are the perfect secretaries, assistants, companions. They have a very fluid personality, but their fluidity is not nourishing. They are, however, serviceable, concerned, totally domestic, resourceful within limits, humorous, well-mannered, sweet, delicate. In other words, they are the nicest people one could find, but they have one huge flaw: they can't function alone. They are always in need of someone to direct them. With direction, no matter how strained or antagonistic that direction might be, they are stupendous. By themselves, they perish.\n\nPeople in the second class are not nice at all. They are petty, vindictive, envious, jealous, self-centered. They talk exclusively about themselves and usually demand that people conform to their standards. They always take the initiative even though they are not comfortable with it. They are thoroughly ill at ease in every situation and never relax. They are insecure and are never pleased. The more insecure they become, the nastier they are. Their fatal flaw is that they would kill to be leaders.\n\nIn the third category are people who are neither nice nor nasty. They serve no one, nor do they impose themselves on anyone. Rather they are indifferent. They have an exalted idea about themselves derived solely from daydreams and wishful thinking. If they are extraordinary at anything, it is at waiting for things to happen. They are waiting to be discovered and conquered and have a marvelous facility for creating the illusion that they have great things in abeyance, which they always promise to deliver but never do because, in fact, they do not have such resources.\n\nDon Juan said that he himself definitely belonged to the second class. He then asked me to classify myself and I became rattled. Don Juan was practically on the ground, bent over with laughter.\n\nHe urged me again to classify myself, and reluctantly I suggested I might be a combination of the three.\n\n\"Don't give me that combination nonsense,\" he said, still laughing. \"We are simple beings, each of us is one of the three types. And as far as I am concerned, you belong to the second class. Stalkers call them farts.\"\n\nI began to protest that his scheme of classification was demeaning. But I stopped myself just as I was about to go into a long tirade.   Instead I commented that if it were true that there are only three types of personalities, all of us are trapped in one of those three categories for life with no hope of change or redemption.\n\nHe agreed that that was exactly the case. Except that one avenue for redemption remained. Sorcerers had long ago learned that only our personal self-reflection fell into one of the categories.\n\n\"The trouble with us is that we take ourselves seriously,\" he said. \"Whichever category our self-image falls into only matters because of our self-importance. If we weren't self-important, it wouldn't matter at all which category we fell into.\n\n\"I'll always be a fart,\" he continued, his body shaking with laughter. \"And so will you.

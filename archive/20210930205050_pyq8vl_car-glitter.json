But then you can paint over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to do that, but Carlos deviated me from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About not-doings.  Until you can wiggle your fingers on a flat white surface that materialized in front of you in the darkness, and stimulate little dream visions to materialize and detach, you won&amp;#39;t completely understand not-doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, you could go into the federal building and take a dump on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That would work as a not-doing too!  Even if you didn&amp;#39;t get arrested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because not-doings add some energy of awareness to emanations you don&amp;#39;t normally use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;re practicing &amp;quot;reskimming&amp;quot; emanations, that&amp;#39;s when you notice new ones have some extra awareness in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A silly example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent is like a blind, deaf, alien cook.  He can&amp;#39;t really communicate with you directly, so he uses telepathy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the darkroom  you think, &amp;quot;I need some food.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He looks through everything left in your mind, to figure out what to cook up for you. He gives preference to what you like most, but it&amp;#39;s really noisy in your head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our trick is to empty our mind, so that the only thing left is a memory of that tasty hamburger we ate last week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your mind dwells on breakfast sausages, the results can be unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not-doing is used in that story, when you keep getting bagels each time, because your mind is so blank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You go to the candy store for a visit.  Look at each candy item, and smell it too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That alters what the cook finds in your memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might still get a bagel, but it&amp;#39;ll have candy toppings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_pyq8vl", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pyq8vl/car_glitter/htm2e3a/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1642781071.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1642781071.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "htlpmlt", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1642776100.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_htl5460", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "Absolutely!  \n\n\nI've also noticed I'm (almost) automatically silent when gathering in sunlight energy, so that by itself makes it worthwhile.

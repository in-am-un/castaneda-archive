Oddly, Arizona seems to have a plethora of moths.  I suppose the dry desert expanses give them plenty of room to find mates.\n\nIn fact, if you drive for Arizona out of the lower highways of California, you know you're almost there in some seasons because your windshield gets pelted with giant moths and you might even have to stop to wash the windshield off.  The wipers and the spray just aren't going to remove that smashed moth junk.\n\nI once took a visitor from Taiwan in the direction of Arizona. I was surprised to hear he was fascinated by our \"Old West\".\n\nI suppose the same way americans are fascinated by the Chinese generational homes featured in Hong Kong Kungfu movies, where people can leap down from the upper story to battle it out in the middle. The one with the flying guillotine comes to mind, but some streets in Beijing are famous for an entire street of very old generational homes. Grand parents on the north, second story, parents on the east, children on the other 2 sides.\n\nOr something like that. It's all designed to show who has the most authority, so being banished to the wrong side is a bit of an insult.\n\nMy Taiwan visitor was so fascinated that we stopped in Calico Ghost town on the long freeway east, and he wanted to look around for more than an hour.\n\nA hard feat at that little rest stop. He seemed bent on buying \"Genuine Western souvenirs\" for Chinese friends back home.\n\nAs we continued on the road, we \"hit the jackpot\".\n\nGiant moths crashed into the windshield, and a little whirlwind tornado formed on the side of the road.   It was clearly visible as a miniature disturbance of swirling wind and sand, more than 20 feet high.  It was  heading in a threatening manner towards our vehicle speeding down the freeway at 80 miles per hour.\n\nAt that same instance, a giant tumbleweed blew across our path.\n\nWe had to hit the brakes and swerve dangerously a bit, to avoid smashing directly into it.\n\nI suppose it was all \"expected\" by him, after watching Road Runner cartoons in Mandarin.  But I've never seen such a display of popular western imagery.\n\nHe got his taste of \"The Old West\".\n\nBy the way, the moth form of Little Smoke is ideal for introducing an apprentice to that ally.\n\nAll they have to do is \"swoop\", the way the moth did at the campfire, and if the apprentice can perceive it he's now engangled emanations with the ally, and the ally with him.\n\nIt's the basis of continuing contact.\n\nCarlos did the same one private class.  But everyone seems to have ignored the contact. \n\nExcept me. Carol Tiggs had already pushed me into a tunnel leading to the world of the inorganic beings.\n\nI got the double Nagual whammy!\n\nI once introduce a man in Asia to Little Smoke. He was quite drunk, and it became obvious he was able to perceive spirits at that point.  He was trying to show me that the altar of ancestor worship, common in Chinese businesses, did in fact manifest the spirit of the father of the business owner, his grandfather, when the ritual with the moon shaped wooden blocks was performed while incense burned. \n\nSo I introduced him to another spirit.\n\nLittle Smoke \"swooped him\", and I was told he was chased at night for years following that event.

You can't grab a puff of purple light up near the ceiling, put it onto your body, then look back up and see nothing.\n\nThere will still be colors up there.\n\nJust a little less.

It's outside the shell, that's all.\n\nJust move your gaze back to your waist and wiggle fingers a while, and you can return to viewing the inside of the shell.\n\nViewing \"outside\" the shell is the \"Readers of Infinity\" thing Carlos wanted us to emphasize.\n\nI suppose he ran out of time, so he connected us to *intent* as a substitute.

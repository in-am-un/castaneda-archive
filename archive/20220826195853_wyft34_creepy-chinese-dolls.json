From wikipedia:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe Boxer Rebellion, also known as the Boxer Uprising, the Boxer Insurrection, or the Yihetuan Movement, was an anti-foreign, anti-colonial, and anti-Christian uprising in China between 1899 and 1901, towards the end of the Qing dynasty, by the Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists (Y\u00ech\u00e9qu\u00e1n), known as the \"Boxers\" in English because many of its members had practised Chinese martial arts, which at the time were referred to as \"Chinese boxing\".\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIf you're a fan of Bruce Lee movies, trust me when I say you'll never understand what's going on from the english version.\n\nYou just won't get it.  You really NEED an actual chinese man sitting next to you during the movie, to \"translate\" it for you.\n\nSuch as the \"weak men of Asia\" sign that's delivered to Bruce's master's house by the Japanese martial arts school.\n\nBut back to the creepy story.  Which I got from Asians, and never bothered to verify for details.\n\nIt was just too good of a story to start nitpicking details!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Baby doll with \\\\\"toy surprise\\\\\" inside.](https://preview.redd.it/1qz3qn7kf3k91.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=723b6d2a00c6c9795108a6353bbee46e7ee22ee9)\n\nSo the story goes that when it became obvious that Daoist Sorcerers were vulnerable to bullets like everyone else, during the Boxer Rebellion,  it put a fear into them that eventually drove them to leave China to go elsewhere that didn't have an obsession with ridding itself of \"bad influences\".\n\nKind of like how our \"lineages\" got started.\n\nThey fled to places where \"bad influences\" were very profitable!\n\nHong Kong for one.  By the way, really bad food there.  Don't believe the locals.  You'll get far better Chinese food in Los Angeles than in Hong Kong.\n\nThey also fled to Singapore, the legendary socialist island of wealthy people and laborers.  Singapore is so well organized, cheap apartments are built by the government to  house the needed laborers to go with the super wealthy asians from all over, who live there with their families.   I used to sell security cameras there, to catch the gangsters throwing buckets of red paint (blood) on the apartment doors of laborers who borrowed money from the mafia, and didn't pay it back.  They used \"shame\" to let all the neighbors know, that man is a dead beat.\n\nThe #1 business there seems to be those little \"mini-mall schools\" you can send your kids to, so they do well on tests in the real schools.\n\nIf you find yourself a tourist there, just go to the bar right next to the Hotel.  French women over in the south east corner, Russian women in the table next to you, and so on.  Women from all over the world go to the bars there in hopes of snagging a wealthy foreigner.  Or so they claim as justification for their liberal dating behavior.\n\nBut Americans are so prudish, they can't stomach the reality of the rest of the non-puritanical world.\n\nThere's an O'Neil blog dedicated to my stories of such things, from the head pope in charge of upholding victorian morals in potential sorcery leaders,  John.\n\nThey also fled to Taiwan, which you might know as \"Formosa\" if you like martial arts. Where shamanism from ancient \"Islander\" tribes still survives a tiny bit.\n\nLast time I visited the tribe up on Mt. Ali,  I was offered an amazing 19 year old granddaughter. Potentially to marry.  She wore a tee shirt saying, \"I love Jakarta\".\n\nA real sewer of intense poverty and Islamic violence.\n\nThe Islander tribes traditionally sold their young women to foreigners there on Mt. Ali in Formosa.  The Dutch loved that place, back when they were sailing around trying to conquer the world.  And burn all witches.\n\nFortunately, Carlos made me celibate.  So I just like window shopping.\n\nThey also fled to Malaysia, which I suppose is near what used to be called Burma. I've never been over there, so I'm not sure. But the attraction there for the Daoist sorcerers, was the common practice of molesting little boys. Common in the Buddhist church.\n\nIt's one of those \"little details\" about Daoism which never gets \"translated\" when bad western men try to create \"franchises\" to sell here,  using \"foreign magic\". They misrepresent something like Daoism, sanitize it, and make it convincing to ignorant westerners who think it's got to be wise if it's Asian.\n\nBut any Chinese knows why the Daoist \"priest\" has 2 little boy apprentices following him around.\n\nChristians are no better.  Search the bible for \"effeminate\", where one of the Apostles is lecturing his flock, and then go find out what that word really means, from the old english.\n\nAnd my favorite, they fled to Thailand for obvious reasons.\n\nI go there to sell cameras, to protect against Islamic bombings.\n\nBut I can't avoid admiring the local customs.\n\nThe Thai still had slavery just shy of 100 years ago.  And the slave markets for beautiful women never really went away.\n\nThe vietnam war just transformed them into bars with names like, \"Soy Cowboy 2\", my favorite.\n\nThe \"madame\" there used to be a friend of mine.\n\nNEVER criticize the king in Thailand.  You can be killed with a club for doing that.  No joking!\n\nAs the Daoist sorcerers fled, along with them they brought creepy dolls.\n\nHere's how it works.\n\nChinese philosophy is not at all \"one thing\".  It's not even 3 things. It's a big mix of everything they could steal or borrow from other places, the same as the cheap products they've flooded us with.\n\nAll good these days due to buying help from Russian and Australian engineers!\n\nCurse the Chinese...\n\nSo in Chinese \"philosophy\" there are all sorts of social rules and forces, and \"stifling\" conformity is always heavily embedded in there.\n\nPeople need to rebel a little.\n\nBut it  has to be in a social acceptable way.\n\nIn Tokyo for example, if you look around you can find a \"motorcycle gang\".  Try near Shibuya as I recall.\n\nScary looking!  They have \"hogs\" that would make a hell's angel man from San Bernardino county drool.\n\nAnd women...  Wow.\n\nLeather mini skirts, chains attached to their waist, legs in boots high up on the seat of their ride, so you can look right up their skirt.\n\nThey pose for you, with their angry hells angel gang member boyfriends.\n\nIt's a very menacing sight, until you walk up and ask one of the hell's angels men what time it is.\n\nHe'll rush over bowing profusely with his other \"tough\" male associates, and helpfully push his watch out with both hands, while he practices his english on you.\n\nHis girlfriends will cover their mouths behind him, as they giggle.  They actually have a \"formation\" they created, for such things as greeting people who show an interest in them.\n\nThey aren't tough at all.\n\nIt's just a \"cool look\" that's socially acceptable.\n\nYou can rebel in Asia, but you have to select your form of rebellion from a socially acceptable range of selections.\n\nMy favorite is the \"Goth Lolita\" look.  It used to be extremely popular around 30 years ago.   It even made it out to the USA.\n\nAnd don't ask where that fashion style comes from. You don't want to know.\n\nWhen it comes to witchcraft and magic, there are also \"socially acceptable forms\".\n\nThe creepy doll is one of them.\n\nThe bones of aborted or murdered babies are dug up from graveyards, or purchased from the clinic, and embedded in dolls.\n\nJackie Chan even has a medallion holding on.\n\nSince the babies either were never born, or lived a very short life, they didn't manage to build up enough \"Karma points\" to make it into the afterlife, with all the ancestors.\n\nAnd since they're dead, they're magic.\n\nIf you purchase a creepy doll, you can take it home and treat it like your own child.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sometimes the \\\\\"ashes\\\\\" are kept in a medallion. But just .001&amp;#37; dead baby.](https://preview.redd.it/895qzcl7p3k91.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8308c3c17d0521ead24c198dec589fa10602eaf)\n\nIf you give the doll all of your love and affection it builds up a debt to you.  And is obligated to help out your family.\n\nAs a result of receiving the love it never did in a real life, and for helping others with its ghost magic, it can build up enough \"karma\" to make it into the afterlife.\n\nThe dolls are expensive, since they contain human body parts.\n\nSo families will share them.  Little baby Jane visits one lonely woman for one week, and then gets passed to the next family for another week.\n\nIt's dark magic, but it's socially acceptable because it follows religious traditions, and serves a \"higher purpose\".\n\nTo free the soul of a baby who never got to live.\n\nJust keep in mind, if you like \"Chinese mysticism\".\n\nYou have no clue at all what it really is.\n\nIt's been \"sanitized\" for \"franchising\".\n\nAnd the men selling it to you, are worse than the men who make those creepy dolls.\n\nAt least those men provide an \"honest service\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Creepy Chinese Dolls", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t":

They actually have a &amp;quot;formation&amp;quot; they created, for such things as greeting people who show an interest in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;#39;t tough at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a &amp;quot;cool look&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s socially acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can rebel in Asia, but you have to select your form of rebellion from a socially acceptable range of selections.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite is the &amp;quot;Goth Lolita&amp;quot; look.  It used to be extremely popular around 30 years ago.   It even made it out to the USA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;#39;t ask where that fashion style comes from. You don&amp;#39;t want to know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to witchcraft and magic, there are also &amp;quot;socially acceptable forms&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The creepy doll is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bones of aborted or murdered babies are dug up from graveyards, or purchased from the clinic, and embedded in dolls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jackie Chan even has a medallion holding on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the babies either were never born, or lived a very short life, they didn&amp;#39;t manage to build up enough &amp;quot;Karma points&amp;quot; to make it into the afterlife, with all the ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And since they&amp;#39;re dead, they&amp;#39;re magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you purchase a creepy doll, you can take it home and treat it like your own child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/895qzcl7p3k91.png?width=700&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c8308c3c17d0521ead24c198dec589fa10602eaf\"&gt;Sometimes the \\&amp;quot;ashes\\&amp;quot; are kept in a medallion. But just .001&amp;#37; dead baby.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you give the doll all of your love and affection it builds up a debt to you.  And is obligated to help out your family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result of receiving the love it never did in a real life, and for helping others with its ghost magic, it can build up enough &amp;quot;karma&amp;quot; to make it into the afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dolls are expensive, since they contain human body parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So families will share them.  Little baby Jane visits one lonely woman for one week, and then gets passed to the next family for another week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s dark magic, but it&amp;#39;s socially acceptable because it follows religious traditions, and serves a &amp;quot;higher purpose&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To free the soul of a baby who never got to live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just keep in mind, if you like &amp;quot;Chinese mysticism&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have no clue at all what it really is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been &amp;quot;sanitized&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;franchising&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the men selling it to you, are worse than the men who make those creepy dolls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least those men provide an &amp;quot;honest service&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null,

Someone was eating someone else, using sharp little knives as we well know.\n\nMy suspicion is that the \"Men of Knowledge\" were giant pains in the ass of the old seers, the same way the modern version (people who only read the first few books) are a pain in the ass in this subreddit, where \"seeing\" is our goal, not \"Man of Knowledge rituals\".\n\nIn the middle east, the Akkadians gave rise to Ishtar, the goddess of the moon, who fell to earth in an egg and was saved from the lake by rabbits.\n\nThe forerunner of \"Easter\".  Ishtar.\n\nHer sex and descriptions changed completely every 100 years if you follow it, and evolved into Iranian religious systems designed to sell \"trinkets\" in the market place.\n\nEventually traveling into India to become \"Hinduism\".  The famous \"pure\" people's the Nazis admired are somehow connected to that migration.\n\nWhich might  have had a \"taint\" of another of the ancient Shamanism systems, now lost, through some local natives already in India.\n\nThe Dravidians was it?

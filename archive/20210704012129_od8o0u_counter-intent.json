Did it feel like that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, I had to admit, her &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; she told me, felt entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then it wasn&amp;#39;t me&amp;quot;, Lily said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, the fliers lick your toes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But flies land on shit.  And they didn&amp;#39;t attack a shit monster to get it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the fliers don&amp;#39;t extract the energy. They just lap up what you indulged off of yourself, with counter intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even walking around leaves single emanations in the environment.  We have so many we can drop them as we walk and it&amp;#39;s not even a drop in the bucket. According to Carlos, we leave a trail of emanations as we walk along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we indulge, we cast them all over into the environment, eagerly, and some &amp;quot;get stuck&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our shiny outer glow diminishes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the fliers are just scavengers, and actually do us a favor by licking our toes. They pick up loose emanations, maybe even sucking them back from where they got stuck, like strands of spaghetti.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The clean up patrol?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Carlos needed a &amp;quot;worthy opponent&amp;quot; for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And being Carlos, he was going to follow the books.  Copy the map.  Hook us to &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The map called for a worthy opponent, after introducing the apprentice to the topic of sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos introduced it to his workshops for a couple of years, before he brought out the fliers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he took the hapless fliers, a harmless scavenger not capable of much but licking, and pretended they were dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saying they lick us, and cause us to indulge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe we indulge, and THEN they lick us to get the energy we wasted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos perhaps reversed the order?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same way don Juan pretended La Catalina was dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real beings, but not actually real enemies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point, thinking about all this, I turned to Lily hoping she&amp;#39;d verify it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She just stared at me.  Like she wasn&amp;#39;t going to call Carlos a liar even if it was true.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/od8o0u/counter_intent/h41o5vl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1625421738.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_od8o0u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h44ix9v", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1625490618.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h3zedzz", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Yes, it must be that!\n\nIdeas are so compelling, that we defend them until the last moment.\n\nSometimes it happens to me that I don't blurt out an idea, and it even takes hours until I realize it and I do.\n\nThat's wasting time.\n\nSitted to practice, but using time to fantasize...", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h44ix9v", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it must be that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideas are so compelling, that we defend them until the last moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it happens to me that I don&amp;#39;t blurt out an idea, and it even takes hours until I realize it and I do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s wasting time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sitted to practice, but using time to fantasize...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_od8o0u", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/od8o0u/counter_intent/h44ix9v/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1625490618.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h3zedzz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "the-mad-prophet", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1625365477.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_od8o0u", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_4dz9kepm", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt; Somehow, to move the assemblage point you need to immerse yourself in our honesty, and discard ulterior motives\n\nVery much this.

Usually I go to chat to try to save some, but this is kind of interesting stuff.  And there's plenty else I won't be able to save, so I'll cut this one off as a single topic.\n\nThough...  Lily was telling me an intriguing variation on Scrooge where we're the scrooges, and the allies of don Juan, Genaro, and Vicente are still around looking for people to haunt.  Expect a visit from each was what she was implying.   When I asked her which one she was, I couldn't get more out of her.\n\nI sure hope so!  What would that be?  Nine potential magic teachers for all of us?\n\nBut she was also going to finish telling me the story of the amusement park, and then just dumped me at barely able to get to the entrance, let alone enter.  I complained once, but she said she told me the story and it's not her fault if I forget things too easily.\n\nSo here's what she taught me.\n\nI was noticing that at the very bottom of the J curve, things are very red and orange, and kind of \"hot\".  Or at the least, brilliant.\n\nIf you slide away from the bottom going up the back, things dull down a bit, and get pinkish.\n\nAnd you know you messed up, because the magic is getting less vivid.  That catches your attention, and causes some internal dialogue to return. Mostly blaming yourself.\n\nBut in fact, Lily says it dulls down going back up on either side, and you might actually have been moving it up on the stomach side.\n\nIn that case the color change is different. Instead of pink, it is more bluish purple on that side.\n\nThe bluish purple fades to whitish as you move up, and once it's bright enough you notice it.  You are now *seeing* energy.\n\nBut what should it look like?\n\nThere's where I got obsessed with more power, and learned to manipulate the energy to produce my favorite thing: dreams in the air.\n\nHere's where it gets tricky.  you have to understand, \"residual intent\".\n\nThink Matrix Movie, and their \"residual body image\".  It causes them all to look like themselves in the Matrix, even though in the real world they have those plugs on their back, and no hair.\n\nThe whitish light is energy that hasn't been formed by intent yet.  If  you are viewing it consciously, it will respond to any intent you give off, or locate in the emanations.\n\nSo if you are hoping for little hand sized dreams in front of you, or a nicely formed beam of dream on the floor nearby, but not harming anyone, sort of like a spotlight, then you have set  your \"residual distance\" control.\n\nYou are focusing on the energy that's located in a band around 2 feet away, extending to possibly 6 feet.\n\nYou've already put a limit on the energy.  There's only so many things it will do, at that specific \"range\".\n\nAnd in order to make it very active, I always looked for the vertical lines texture.  By doing that, I specified the \"residual thickness\" also.  I've limited it to the shape of a scooped out cantaloupe, as a thicker shell a little further away than my body.\n\nInstead, have no opinion of what the whitish light out to look like or do, and intent will \"make you an offer you can't refuse\".\n\nUntil you've learned many.\n\n\"Seeing energy\" magic is one of the most fun, as Carlos tried to show us on that book cover with all the moon phases.\n\nHere's some sample distances and what they can do.  But keep in mind, this magic has no limits as far as we know.  You could do something totally crazy, such as seeing energy on the other side of an actual pipe, and learn what you can do from that.\n\nIf the distance is the walls of your room, you will tend to start out by noticing a phantom room.  How real it looks depends on how much percent dreaming double.  But in it's vague form, it's ripe for playing with.  You can translocate anywhere you can think of. Jungle, desert, the cave of the inorganic beings.\n\nAt finger tip touching distance, you can play with the whitish light and make objects fall from it.  Toys, magical objects for remote viewing. If you smooth your hand across it, you can locate shadow beings. If you tickle the individual fibers of whitish light you can find in it, you can skim and build your own dream, from any recognition of a tiny element of it.  So if you see a scale, you can build a fish swimming in the ocean.\n\nWhen the whitish light fills the room, you get the crystalline dreaming fog but as viewed with the assemblage point in the front. It's like bars or streaks of whitish light, filling the room, but creating a feeling of space filled with objects you could sneak through. \n\nThat can be used to suck the entire room into a dream, with you in it.\n\nSilvio Manuel's steps are particularly useful for that, being dance move like.  The bars of whitish light are close together, and just a step or two can move you to another place.\n\nIf the whitish light is located outside the room, it summons the intent of real energetic places.  Because it spread out, it's more able to find higher energy levels of intent.\n\nThat form of \"seeing energy\" is closer to silent knowledge, because to use it you just sit up on a bed and be aware of it (like being aware of \"the force\"), and it brings things to your attention.\n\nIt causes you to want to turn your head and look a specific direction, and when you do you find out you just dived into a full on dream.  You can turn the head back if you like, and you'll be back on the bed.  Or you can stay in the dream for hours.\n\nAll are the same technique.

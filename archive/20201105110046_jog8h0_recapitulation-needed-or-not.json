Then you flick your fingers (La Gorda's flying technique), to make the fingers visible.  And to light up the area in front of you, with fine vertical lines.\n\nThen you tease the web in front of you with your now visible fingers, with the intent of finding the limits of the energy body in front of you.    Forget about distance, it doesn't matter. Try various.  But you can reach the limit (around 6 feet away) even if your fingers are wiggling only two feet away.\n\nWhen some is visible, scoop it into the V spot.\n\nThen do the moving energy from back to front, Westwood dreaming series.\n\nScoop that onto your torso all the way up. You're picking up the redeployed dreaming energy, and using it to make your torso visible.\n\nTorso ought to be visible now along with both ands and fingers.\n\nNext you reach the arms up high, but to the sides, while leaning all the way back (feet spread).

Inhale it almost as deeply as you can (you're leaning back, so you might pass out).  While scooping the hands in, try to feel some cobwebs on the right arm (top side).  If not, scoop again.  You need the cobwebs on there.\n\nNow turn to your right and look all the way back, without moving the legs.  You can move them closer together if you had them spread a lot.\n\nPush your right arm back there, palm down.  Slowly sweep it across the room at chest level, while feeling for heat.  It should still be visible, but if not, use a slight rocking motion to scoop up more light from the air, to stick on the arms.\n\nTry to see energy on the walls.  And consider, you're also gathering up the energy from your luminous shell, to bring it closer (and form the dreaming double).\n\nKeep sweeping very slowly until your IOB sticks to the top of your arm.  Reward her by slowly moving the arm the rest of the way (it's a 270 degree sweep.)  As it moves along, bring her up into any brightness you see, so she can absorb it.\n\nIf she doesn't show up, stop at the first \"disturbance\" or sensation of heat, or thick patch of cobwebs, and move the arm up high, sort of rocking it around to try to get the disturbance to energize the back of your right hand.\n\nBring the results down to waist level on the right side, and look to see if you have an IOB. If you do, talk to her a bit.\n\nUse the left hand in claw mode to scoop up energy and rub it on her. Or if your right hand only has a disturbance, to energize the disturbance.\n\nKeep that up until you can see lights in the claw hand.\n\nThen put it next to the right hand, and try to make the lights on the hands more intense by slowly moving them around over a virtual surface at your hips, stretching out as far as your hands can reach, parallel to the floor.\n\nTry to disturb that flat area until you can see the apron of fibers of the luminous body.\n\nTry up or down, to find exactly the right level to get maximum disturbances.\n\nWhen you find it, move the fingers out and start wiggling at that level, as far as you can reach out comfortably, and 4 inches to the right of center.\n\nKeep wiggling until you can literally feel something \"as thick as water\", even if it's just single cobwebs.\n\nBut you WILL eventually find something as thick as water, and it will blow your mind (at 80% dreaming double, so there's not much left to blow).\n\nWiggle that back to the stomach as if you were making it move back with the wiggle.\n\nSmear it across your stomach to make that visible, and then up and down your legs and over the tops of your feet, to make them visible.\n\nNow stop, and pull on each finger while holding it in a relaxed fashion at your stomach level. Start with left little finger, surround with fingers of right, squeeze fairly hard, and pull suddenly to the right, to make the finger \"snap\".\n\nRepeat until thumb, then do the other hand.\n\nYou should see fibers extending from the hand, especially the little fingers.\n\nPass done.\n\nRepeat at least 4 times.\n\nAll hell breaks out for me.\n\nFancy even feels like dancing after that (sometimes).", "edited": 1604684377.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gbd6ui5", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s going to take me a very long time to draw it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, if you can see colors in darkness, you could design your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea is to get the colors to be present on your entire body by the end of the form.

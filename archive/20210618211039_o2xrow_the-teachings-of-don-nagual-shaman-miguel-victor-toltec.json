Don Juan starts out as \"Mr. Abelar\", and then becomes \"Nagual\" to her.\n\nThat's not just for storyline. They're trying to teach us something there.  The books are fully of hidden instruction.\n\nCholita was taught that way. To call Carlos, \"Nagual\", and nothing else.  She felt like she'd be cursed if she made a mistake.\n\nI used to have a hard time following her stories because of how she  only used the term \"Nagual\"  to refer to Carlos.\n\nI always just called him Carlos, and he was fine with that.\n\nI'm going to answer your questions, but you're too obsessed with that issue.\n\nIt indicates the \"book deal mind\".\n\nPurge yourself of that!\n\nYou have to want magic, only because you want magic.\n\nCan't be any other reason, or you'll get next to no *intent* gifts.\n\nA story: I had a cousin who found a gold nugget on his farm.\n\nA BIG one!  I was really jealous, because at one time I collected gold nuggets.\n\nDidn't have one from his state.\n\nHe searched more with a metal detector, and never found another.\n\nBut he cashed in on that gold nugget big time!\n\nHe convinced people to come work on his farm, and in exchange they could keep half, if they found another nugget on his property.\n\nI wouldn't say that motivated them, but there were several farms in the area and one had better farm girls around.\n\nAll paid the same.\n\nThe gold nugget beat the farm girls.\n\nHe had them digging post holes as their favorite assignment.\n\nI asked him if he didn't feel bad about it, and he pointed to a happy farm worker.\n\nHe said you can tell when they \"turn\". They stop being interested in the gold nuggets.\n\nThey end up actually liking the farm.\n\n\\&gt;Do you think that if one is a double being him/her self, its easier to be connected to intent, without a nagual teacher?\n\nNo, I suspect it's impossible.  You have to get the introduction.\n\nBUT, the books of Carlos are good enough introduction.\n\nThe books of anyone else are not.\n\nThere's \"nagual\" hidden in the books.  Like telling someone, \"doesn't that soup taste a little too sweet?\"\n\nIf you never mentioned it, they'd keep eating the soup without noticing that.  \n\nBut once that idea gets into their head, it won't leave.\n\nThere's stuff like that in the books.

Undoubtedly they received a gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But  they&amp;#39;re gone now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I suppose, Carol did help us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She and the witches might have concluded, they needed to leave it as Carlos left it to give his intent a chance to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or they might have concluded the entire community is hopeless.  Contaminated with greed and bullying.  And too lazy to be teachable outside of an actual lineage of 15 powerful sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan did say, volunteers are usually cracked.  Maybe the witches didn&amp;#39;t realize how many are cracked, and how many not cracked, but over time decided the &amp;quot;usually&amp;quot; means, &amp;quot;nearly always&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In here, even with intense personal help only 1 in 500 who tick up that Member&amp;#39;s count will become sorcerers in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But dozens will get to see what it really is.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most will decide it&amp;#39;s not for them once they understand what it really means. It&amp;#39;s cold outside the river.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or the witches might have decided the workshops killed Carlos, and don&amp;#39;t want to risk that fate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, Carol got taken over by Xoxo and her motivations are changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, Carlos let them off the hook before he died, and told them how much to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, Carlos is still around as far as they&amp;#39;re concerned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe a better question than asking the IOBs about the dome, would be to ask them what&amp;#39;s going on with the witches?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They like that sort of question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the answer could be very entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should mention, there&amp;#39;s likely a technique to viewing the answers coming from the Emissary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It works sort of like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The IOBs like to interact with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With strangers, the best they can do is scare them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the other end of the spectrum, they teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seems to be their favorite type of interaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, you can easily &amp;quot;interrupt&amp;quot; them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they stop.  You&amp;#39;re out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Book deal mind interrupts them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another question interrupts them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying out what they are showing you,  but while doing it finding something else that&amp;#39;s interesting, interrupts them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So once we have a bunch of sorcerers in here who have IOBs of their own,  we could figure out the best way to take a lesson from the Emissary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/o2xrow/the_teachings_of_don_nagual_shaman_miguel_victor/h3c13ak/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1624896522.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_o2xrow", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 0, "name": "t1__", "id": "_", "parent_id": "t1_h3c69ms", "depth": 10, "children": []}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h3c69ms", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dunemi", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1624898771.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h3c2nj8", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6upmf", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Oh, I'm sorry I missed this.

Time passing: I don\u2019t understand this question.  You mean \u201clost time\u201d?  That happens when you stop the world and don\u2019t remember it.  Or an Ally pulls you somewhere you aren\u2019t advanced enough to remember.\n\nYou\u2019re skating on the edge and it\u2019s pretty easy to step over without realizing it.  Might feel normal at the time, but later it\u2019s all gone.\n\nBut if you mean, use up time just waiting in silence, that\u2019s going to be a lot harder at first than if you find something to interact with. Even better, move around.\n\nYou\u2019ll fall asleep if you get to a certain level of silence and your assemblage point hasn\u2019t shifted to heightened awareness yet. We\u2019re used to falling asleep when it moves.  By the time you get to heightened awareness you are in fact asleep, but without being unconscious. That\u2019s why heightened awareness is useful for this technique. You\u2019re already asleep.\n\nEventually of course after playing around you\u2019ll return to the bed and finish off the job by stopping the world.  Or you\u2019ll get waylaid and notice another world you can assemble, and go off there instead of stopping the world.\n\nThat happens when, after hours, you understand what\u2019s keeping you from the very deepest level of silence (you\u2019ll figure it out), and you go do what has to be done to get to that.  You\u2019ll IMMEDIATELY stop the world if you get there.  That\u2019s how it stops.  We stop making it.\n\nThis assumes you keep going for many hours.  And I\u2019m sure that sounds hard, or impossible to everyone who hasn\u2019t done it. But ask yourself, can you watch TV reruns for 5 hours?\n\nThis is even more fun than TV once you get good at it.  3 hours will go by in a jiffy.  5 will only feel like you gave it a good try.  8 is what feels like you worked hard at it.\n\nRemember Carlos mentioning that the fliers mind is only driven off with discipline? Or that we only lose the human form through a sustained effort.\n\nSorry to tell you, this is what that looks like. You can't for example, avoid stepping on the cracks on the sidewalk, stop eating ice cream, and then expect to lose the human form.  That's not the kind of discipline that will make noticeable progress.\n\nJust as people were expecting something  unattainable to be \"heightened awareness\", but hopefully now realize, it's not that big of a deal,  \"discipline\" is also kind of obvious.\n\nYou actually have to work, instead of just thinking about how it will feel when you finally decide to work.\n\n2) Exploring: This is important for my method of doing it.  Zuleica just had them find colors, and then figure out how to pull the colors closer.\n\nBut remember, THEY WERE IN HEIGHTENED AWARENESS.  They couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\n\nI never tried cocaine, but imagine if you snorted a shitload.  I had a girlfriend like that. No way she would fall asleep, and she had so much confidence that she\u2019d climb dangerous rocks without blinking.\n\nThat\u2019s heightened awareness.\n\nWe have to modify the techniques because we aren\u2019t in heightened awareness.\n\nInteracting with the second attention is what will move your assemblage point into heightened awareness, instead of falling asleep from being silent.\n\nDoesn\u2019t much matter how you interact, as long as it feels like you are indeed \u201cdoing something\u201d with stuff that normally shouldn\u2019t be there.  If you have limited resources, I suppose you could just turn your head slowly and look at stuff.\n\nOnce you get into heightened awareness, Zuleica\u2019s technique will be a piece of cake. When you tickle it, and force a deeper level of silence, you\u2019ll see your hands move in dark energy.\n\nThat\u2019s not using light to see them, but maybe just your mind knowing where they should be when they wiggle like that, and being nice enough to show it to you.\n\nIf you see the dark energy waves of your finger wiggling, the assemblage point of the second attention will become visible.  It'll be a little spiral galaxy looking thing, but not as filled in.\n\nWarning:  to see the dark energy movements will need a level of silence beyond what you'll be able to manage at first.  \n\nI'd say for this technique there are at least 3 levels of silence:\n\nA) Good enough to see colors but they're not bright enough to form hypnogogic images.\n\nB) Good enough silence to see very bright colors, and they can easily manifest details.\n\nC) Good enough to see the movement of things that can't possibly be seen at that light level.\n\n\nC) is where you can find inorganic beings (spiny or wavy lines of bright light), open a portal to a dreaming world only accessible with silence (one where you're always lucid), or you can even stop the world.  \n\nBut to get started playing and moving your assemblage point, you only need #A.\n\n3) Moving hands:  The harp is just a recommendation by Zuleica.  But do it at first.\n\nWhen you can *see* your hands wiggle there, and the second attention's assemblage point becomes visible (you\u2019ll slowly figure it out), then you can just pull the colors.  Grab them like a rope, and pull as much as you like.\n\nIf someone gets there and doesn\u2019t figure it out, and I\u2019m not dead yet, just ask. There\u2019re more tips I can give on that, than reddit will allow in a single post.\n\n4) paying attention:  I don\u2019t understand this one, but I fear you are going the wrong direction.\n\nImagine an archer, staring at the target, not moving, his concentration absolute.  He's mastered the very expensive \"perfect breath\", so that nothing at all can interfere with his aim.\n\nWrong direction\u2026\n\nI never saw a Zen archer, and I hear they actually aren\u2019t good enough to justify the mystery they evoke. And that weirdness with flaring the nostrils seems kind of painful. I sure wouldn't want my nostrils flared.\n\nBut from what I\u2019ve heard, they don\u2019t even aim at the target.\n\nThat\u2019s the right direction.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean you can afford to think about Aunt Ethel\u2019s old car, the argument you had with your boss that was really unfair, or why you ate that whole pizza.\n\nYou have to be there, watching the colors, and suffering horribly each time you realize, you started fantasizing again.  Shit.\n\nWell\u2026 I hope you suffer horribly when you start the internal dialogue by mistake, or I won\u2019t get any of you guys to stop the world, which is when my job is done.\n\nNow some good news! Once you can stop the world, you can actually talk while doing this.  I give commands to my Fairy all the time.  I even call, \u201cHere kitty, kitty, kitty!\u201d when I\u2019m trying to find her, after she\u2019s half cat and half Fairy.\n\nSome of the rules go out the window once you get there.\n\nSomeone suggested I put a camera in my room, in case I jump into another dreaming world. They expected to see me disappear.\n\nProblem is, mostly you\u2019ll see me on the ground looking at something that isn\u2019t there, stroking its fur that also isn't there, saying, \u201cOh, you\u2019re such a pretty kitty!!!\u201d\n\nThat kind of evidence might even hold up in court.\n\nEdited: five times", "edited": 1561680051.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_es7m3or", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1).

It&amp;#39;ll be a little spiral galaxy looking thing, but not as filled in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warning:  to see the dark energy movements will need a level of silence beyond what you&amp;#39;ll be able to manage at first.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say for this technique there are at least 3 levels of silence:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A) Good enough to see colors but they&amp;#39;re not bright enough to form hypnogogic images.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B) Good enough silence to see very bright colors, and they can easily manifest details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C) Good enough to see the movement of things that can&amp;#39;t possibly be seen at that light level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C) is where you can find inorganic beings (spiny or wavy lines of bright light), open a portal to a dreaming world only accessible with silence (one where you&amp;#39;re always lucid), or you can even stop the world.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to get started playing and moving your assemblage point, you only need #A.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Moving hands:  The harp is just a recommendation by Zuleica.  But do it at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; your hands wiggle there, and the second attention&amp;#39;s assemblage point becomes visible (you\u2019ll slowly figure it out), then you can just pull the colors.  Grab them like a rope, and pull as much as you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone gets there and doesn\u2019t figure it out, and I\u2019m not dead yet, just ask. There\u2019re more tips I can give on that, than reddit will allow in a single post.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) paying attention:  I don\u2019t understand this one, but I fear you are going the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine an archer, staring at the target, not moving, his concentration absolute.  He&amp;#39;s mastered the very expensive &amp;quot;perfect breath&amp;quot;, so that nothing at all can interfere with his aim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wrong direction\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never saw a Zen archer, and I hear they actually aren\u2019t good enough to justify the mystery they evoke. And that weirdness with flaring the nostrils seems kind of painful. I sure wouldn&amp;#39;t want my nostrils flared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But from what I\u2019ve heard, they don\u2019t even aim at the target.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, this doesn\u2019t mean you can afford to think about Aunt Ethel\u2019s old car, the argument you had with your boss that was really unfair, or why you ate that whole pizza.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to be there, watching the colors, and suffering horribly each time you realize, you started fantasizing again.  Shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well\u2026 I hope you suffer horribly when you start the internal dialogue by mistake, or I won\u2019t get any of you guys to stop the world, which is when my job is done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now some good news! Once you can stop the world, you can actually talk while doing this.  I give commands to my Fairy all the time.  I even call, \u201cHere kitty, kitty, kitty!\u201d when I\u2019m trying to find her, after she\u2019s half cat and half Fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the rules go out the window once you get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone suggested I put a camera in my room, in case I jump into another dreaming world. They expected to see me disappear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Problem is, mostly you\u2019ll see me on the ground looking at something that isn\u2019t there, stroking its fur that also isn&amp;#39;t there, saying, \u201cOh, you\u2019re such a pretty kitty!!!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That kind of evidence might even hold up in court.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: five times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_c3uani", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/c3uani/entering_heightened_awareness_outside_of_toltec/es7m3or/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1561673979.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "es7f1gu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "tryerrr", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_es6iqp0", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_n9h6v", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "How important is (in priority)\n1) time passing by itself = just waiting in silence\n2) attention/curiosity, exploring by moving eyes\n3) moving hands, playing harp on right point\n4) paying attention as if something tremendously important is happening (difficult to sustain for long?)", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_es7f1gu", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How important is (in priority)\n1) time passing by itself = just waiting in silence\n2) attention/curiosity, exploring by moving eyes\n3) moving hands, playing harp on right point\n4) paying attention as if something tremendously important is happening (difficult to sustain for long?)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_c3uani", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/c3uani/entering_heightened_awareness_outside_of_toltec/es7f1gu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1561669537.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1561669537.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "es6iqp0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_es47gre", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;Heightened awareness(HA) is not something mythic or unreachable condition of mind,\n\nLet me add that the simplest form of heightened awareness is present when you close your eyes, or while meditating already, and the blackness you see, with your eye lids in the way, takes on depth.\n\nYou're first looking at flat blackness, and maybe if you are talented you see some vague colors or lines.

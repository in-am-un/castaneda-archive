Lame. All the other systems out there.\n\nAnd everyone knows it!\n\nThey just pretend you can't do better, so that what they have is the \"ultimate\".\n\nBut in fact it's all just simple green line meditative effects from our J curve diagram. And you can do FAR better than those!\n\nThose simple green line effects can really go to your head, especially if you belong to a religion that has little thrones for \"masters\" to sit on.\n\nSystems which tell you that you only get to sit on the little throne and lord it over your own followers, when you are \"ego free\".\n\nEgo free!? What the hell?\n\nSitting on a throne all day instead of exploring the vast reaches of the dark sea of awareness, traveling from unknown reality to reality.\n\nEven transforming into non-human beings.\n\nBut you're \"ego free\" to stay home and listen to followers of your system chant day after day, with everyone looking up to you as \"Master\"???\n\nUnfortunately people fall for that, and so we end up with both delusional Monks chanting to a \"Zen Master\" who is \"egoless\", and also the nasty Zen Master bad guy, actually believing he's egoless.\n\nBecause he gets some \"bliss' and maybe a few crummy visions if he sits still a while.\n\nAll those years of pointless sabotaged meditation techniques paid off in his case, and he got a tiny bit of action.\n\nA little taste of real magic.\n\nAnd because his religious system badly needs to expand and bring in more money, he's declared \"enlightened\".  He can now sit on his own throne, and collect his own donations.\n\nMinus a small commission to the \"temple system\".\n\nAt least he's done better than the other monks!\n\nHe's now fit to \"lead\" as an egoless master.\n\nI once heard one of those masters tell the monks, \"Don't expect to fly to the sun!\"\n\nA very famous Zen master, perhaps one of the most famous in the United States.\n\nGiving such awful advice to his followers.\n\nThe advice being that there's no magic.  Just the dull effects of \"bliss\" and the entertainment value of some meager waking dreams.  And the \"wisdom\" comes from accepting there's no real magic.\n\nA very Japanese point of view indeed!\n\nJust \"fall in line\" and earn your seniority the hard way through hazing.  \n\nSomething westerners don't realize about Asian mysticism.  That it was created as a form of control.  \n\nNot as a path to any kind of freedom.\n\nI find myself in a battle against that sort of thinking these days, but it feels like a losing battle most of the time.\n\nAnd last night I looked up into the darkness at a yellow snowflake made of fire.\n\nThis is a pretty good representation, in this picture.\n\nAn entity was teaching me to guide it around with my hand while doing Tensegrity, so as to illuminate alternate worlds contained in the \"corners\" of the Tensegrity movements.  It was like a \"flying lantern\".\n\nAs if when you change directions during the form, you create a little \"corner\" there which becomes \"real\". And the lantern snowflake could make that \"realer\".\n\nA little alternate reality pocket right in the middle of the tensegrity form.\n\nThe entity was right.\n\nThat did in fact happen.\n\nIt always does, at advanced levels of silence.\n\nBut are those \"real\" I wondered?\n\nI got an answer from this dreaming emissary, who had decided to teach me.\n\nBut not about what I had understood.\n\nShe guided me to let my tonal body \"shrink\", until I could interact with that fire snowflake as \"real\".\n\nSolid.\n\nI reached up and grabbed either side, removing it from the air like taking a painting off a wall.\n\nThe entity said, \"You have choices now.  Those choices will let you cling less to the meager opportunities you've found so far in the Tensegrity forms.\n\nYou won't get as excited over simple visions and sensations and make it all go away with your fussiness.  \n\nAnd the more choices you realize you have, the more real it will all become.  Choices work best with \"intent\" if you don't care about them one way or the other.\n\nUntil you can just walk off into any of those little realities you uncover doing Tensegrity, and leave your darkroom behind.  No longer burdened by your physicality.\n\nJust as you can pick up that snowflake in your hands as if it were solid.\"\n\n\"I shrunk my physical body away?\", I asked the entity.\n\nShe replied, \"It's not a good understanding, but it'll make the choices seem more valid. So yes, you 'shrunk the tonal'.\"\n\nBut she added the lesson she had actually intended me to get from her.  And it wasn't about magical snowflakes made of fire.\n\nIt was about fake sorcery teachers.\n\nIt had turned out the day before that one of the worst fake teachers in our community, one people actually admire, had created a fantasy to finish off his series of books, and that fantasy was now becoming part of sorcery \"history\".\n\nWith new bad people picking that up as equivalent to what's in the books of Carlos, and adding their own things to it.\n\nIt was like \"fan made\" movies or TV series episodes, becoming as valid as the original show.\n\nAnd echoing into the future fan made versions.\n\nOur sorcery had become like old Star Trek TV shows.\n\nThey were making new ones, because there was a demand for them.\n\nOne of the worst bad players in our community, a female one, had even started her career of lying to followers with a fan made Star Trek Novel.\n\nThen she graduated to pretend sorcery books.\n\nThe same was happening again in Italy.  With a new bad player woman making up stuff to sell books.\n\nThe entity explained.\n\n\"You had to work hard to get choices during your tensegrity.  But once you had choices,  you could use those to reduce your internal dialogue even further.  The choices help to clean your link to intent, because you can't act on them unless your link to intent is clear and free from greed.\n\nYou can't pick up your fire snowflake, unless your mind is clear and free from a desire to own it and keep it forever.  Or concern over whether it's true or imaginary.\n\nThe same is true of fake sorcery books.  They give people badly needed choices, even if those choices are just a fantasy in their mind.\n\nThey might eventually decide to make them real.\n\nSo groupies today, might become real students tomorrow.  And that's a valid strategy if you want things to change.\n\nJust look at Star Wars. And the positive effect the imaginary Jedi have had on society.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sometimes There's Just Groupies", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"bwyh9wl5weea1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bwyh9wl5weea1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=587162509fcd0de0332bf35143c33a84884bb980"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bwyh9wl5weea1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1142363f10e7f8120381c27551d45186c4e812d9"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bwyh9wl5weea1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5b08965a4fb788ddb20254d5a2ebed6232c3e9e"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bwyh9wl5weea1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e84a1a995ba276e22beb7c508109d7a678e583"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bwyh9wl5weea1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0e67a1dc7dad03d34fe164859cf6762d47908ad"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bwyh9wl5weea1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8d4d8ef193893dbd459fe71c06283a7998cd774"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/bwyh9wl5weea1.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1bde3d97e4fced6c45cdee03034fc74f2fc915b"}, "id": "bwyh9wl5weea1"}}, "name": "t3_10lukgs", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/JGr5IQgKAk_tjoHzESUjniMYG1NXe44nPFLuL-iops8.jpg", "edited": 1674750793.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1674747329.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bwyh9wl5weea1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f1bde3d97e4fced6c45cdee03034fc74f2fc915b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bwyh9wl5weea1.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f1bde3d97e4fced6c45cdee03034fc74f2fc915b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After Carlos died, everyone came out of the woodwork to trash him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;d been doing that since his books first came out, because his books made every other &amp;quot;magical system&amp;quot; look really lame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the attacks really piled on at the end, with his own private students turning on him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he wasn&amp;#39;t around to defend himself anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which by the way, they are.

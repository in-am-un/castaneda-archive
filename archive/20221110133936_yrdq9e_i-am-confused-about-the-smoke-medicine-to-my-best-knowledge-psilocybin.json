Can get it in any big supermarket.\n\nAdd a pinch of a specific (useless) lawn care mineral supplement.  Can't recall the name, but it looks like grey soil.  Supposedly the mycelia like the minerals. But it'll likely work without that.   You could try adding a pinch of dirt if you didn't want to by the $10 bag of that lawn care mineral.\n\nSterilize in a pressure cooker in small mason jars.  The 8 ouncers. Don't get ambitious and try the larger ones.  The 4 ouncers are ok too,  but 8 works very well.\n\nHas to be 90 minutes! Or it's not safely sterilized.  If there are foreign spores in there, they're resistant to even pressure cooking until the water soaks into them and they try to grow.\n\nSterilize the agar agar solution too.  Cool it.  And with absolutely clean hands, get a wire, heat it to red hot with a flame,  let it cool, and swish it around in some spores.  Dip that into your agar agar and swish a tiny bit, then close the lid immediately.\n\nIt'll be obvious when that grows.\n\nThey sell mason jar lids in that size, with a rubber stopper on the lid.  Buy a needle you can sterilize the same way with flame, and when it's time to introduce some of that liquid to the BRF jars, use the needle so there's the least chance of contamination.  Just open your jars without removing the lid, and one by one swirt some of the liquid into each, returning the lid immediately.\n\nNeedles can be reused if you pressure cook them between batches.\n\nKeep in a medium temperature dark place, until it's covered with white fur.\n\nThen transfer the blobs into an aquarium on little rocks in the bottom, cover, and mist it daily to keep it moist.\n\nSpores are not difficult to get. The Feds are tolerant of shrooms these days.  Look in high times magazine or online.  Don't go nuts and try to do \"blue meanies\".  I never got any of those to grow beyond mycelium.\n\nBut in fact, you can buy blue meanie spores from Amsterdam.\n\nWhich by the way, you can simply eat the mycelium.  Wasn't any good for me, since I don't want to get high with it.  Needed the shrooms, not the mycelium.\n\nBut the mycelium works just fine, and probably won't taste awful on that BRF stuff. \n\nGluten free bread is usually just that,  but baked in an oven with some leavening.\n\nAn interesting note. \n\n For our \"psychonaut\" friend who made the post, and seems to like to promote pretend magic.  See his history.  I believe I was right, and his post was actually an attempt to make himself feel better about the path he's gone down, by casting doubt on the subreddit.\n\nBut there's nothing to doubt in here!\n\nWhen don Juan gave Carlos the instructions for drying the shrooms in a clay bottle, they were IDEAL for increasing the mycelium using shredded shrooms.\n\nSo they went into that clay jar, to increase the mass of mycelium.\n\nIf Carlos made that up, he sure did a good job!\n\nI don't believe even the \"famous expert\" Wasson notice that.  He was just so anxious to put Carlos down for all the attention he was getting, that he couldn't think straight.\n\nI have a picture of what a publicity hound Wasson was, and what an eager recipient of it Maria was.  It's on that facebook link I gave.\n\nAnthropologists are notoriously territorial, and hostile to competing anthropologists.\n\nI heard endless tales as a child, with a father who produced and edited books in that category, some for Morongo publishing house.\n\nAnthropologists have the same kind of \"bad players\" we get.\n\nThey even trashed my father at one point when he got too old to defend himself, saying that the dialogue in one of his books, calling the last rebelling indian in southern california a \"young buck\", which is exactly what the sheriff or others in the story called him,  \"racist\". They attributed a line in the book in the dialogue, to my father's opinion.\n\nAfter a lifetime of helping Morongo.\n\nMy movie making brother spent $250,000+ to get those young anthropologists trying to make a name for themselves by attacking my father, to admit it wasn't true.\n\nAnd that was \"pre-woke\" bullying!\n\nBe very careful to avoid contamination during the entire mushroom growing process, and if you are impatient it's not going to be fun.\n\nYou have to understand, at the beginning you're learning. And you only learn from mistakes.  So it will take 10 times longer to get it right.\n\nWhen a blob of mycelium in your aquarium seems done making shrooms, toss it onto damp straw in your yard, in a shady spot, and cover over with just enough soil to hide it.\n\nThat's where the huge ones will come up. If it survives and it's not too cold, and you keep it slightly damp.  Thus the shade.\n\nBut you'll get so much from the jars, you'll have no shortage.\n\nAs for effects, I can get so much higher without drugs they were mostly just annoying.\n\nI think most of the \"psychonaut\" effect is just bad player excitement.  People who've been listening to idiots like McKenna, and pretend  they're on some meaningful exploration of consciousness, by getting high.\n\nThey ignore that any \"raver\" kicks their butt for that activity, and they've gotten nowhere at all, but perhaps into low paying jobs with poor relationships with other people.\n\nBut if you want to get really high, just smoke some Salvia.\n\nAnd it only lasts 10 minutes.\n\nShrooms are for grateful dead concerts.\n\nIf you go that route, you'll end up as delusional as Maria Sabina.\n\nAnd you still won't get that deal with Disney.\n\nAn alternate method:\n\nFind some horse manure that's been bagged and sterilized. They used to sell it at Lowes.\n\nFertilize your whole lawn with it, generously.\n\nThe neighbors won't be happy, but the lawn will love it.\n\nWatch for magic mushrooms.\n\nDon't get too excited over the Panaeolus.\n\nNOT hallucinogenic.  Despite what people believe.\n\nBlue meanings is what you're looking for.\n\nSo if the stem doesn't turn blue when you pluck that mushroom, it's just the common panaeolus. At least, in southern Cal.\n\nUp north, just find bales of hay outdoors where shrooms are growing.  I think there's no shortage of shrooms in Washington and Portland.\n\nFinally, an old woman out here used to make growing kits. They sold them at head shops.\n\nI asked how they can get away with that.\n\nThe owner chastised me (wink wink) and said, \"Those are for science.  You look at the spores you grow in a microscope, and study the mycelium.  It's illegal to consume them!\"\n\nI asked if the feds minded. She said they were mellowing out on such things, and thought maybe soon shrooms would be entirely legal for all uses.\n\nThe woman got too old to make the kits, but I can't imagine there aren't some around. Complete with spores.\n\nIf you make shrooms, you can make ENDLESS spore prints. Each shroom will make at least 3.\n\nAnd you'll get hundreds of shrooms from a few 8 ounce mason jars.\n\nMost small.  But they're all equal in potency, per dried gram.", "edited": 1668354257.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iw7dxnk", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRF method, with agar agar media for the spores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or some commercial media for growing fungus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mix the brown rice flour with the recommended amount of water.

Wasn&amp;#39;t any good for me, since I don&amp;#39;t want to get high with it.  Needed the shrooms, not the mycelium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the mycelium works just fine, and probably won&amp;#39;t taste awful on that BRF stuff. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gluten free bread is usually just that,  but baked in an oven with some leavening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An interesting note. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For our &amp;quot;psychonaut&amp;quot; friend who made the post, and seems to like to promote pretend magic.  See his history.  I believe I was right, and his post was actually an attempt to make himself feel better about the path he&amp;#39;s gone down, by casting doubt on the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s nothing to doubt in here!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When don Juan gave Carlos the instructions for drying the shrooms in a clay bottle, they were IDEAL for increasing the mycelium using shredded shrooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they went into that clay jar, to increase the mass of mycelium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Carlos made that up, he sure did a good job!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe even the &amp;quot;famous expert&amp;quot; Wasson notice that.  He was just so anxious to put Carlos down for all the attention he was getting, that he couldn&amp;#39;t think straight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a picture of what a publicity hound Wasson was, and what an eager recipient of it Maria was.  It&amp;#39;s on that facebook link I gave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropologists are notoriously territorial, and hostile to competing anthropologists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard endless tales as a child, with a father who produced and edited books in that category, some for Morongo publishing house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropologists have the same kind of &amp;quot;bad players&amp;quot; we get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They even trashed my father at one point when he got too old to defend himself, saying that the dialogue in one of his books, calling the last rebelling indian in southern california a &amp;quot;young buck&amp;quot;, which is exactly what the sheriff or others in the story called him,  &amp;quot;racist&amp;quot;. They attributed a line in the book in the dialogue, to my father&amp;#39;s opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a lifetime of helping Morongo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My movie making brother spent $250,000+ to get those young anthropologists trying to make a name for themselves by attacking my father, to admit it wasn&amp;#39;t true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that was &amp;quot;pre-woke&amp;quot; bullying!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be very careful to avoid contamination during the entire mushroom growing process, and if you are impatient it&amp;#39;s not going to be fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to understand, at the beginning you&amp;#39;re learning. And you only learn from mistakes.  So it will take 10 times longer to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When a blob of mycelium in your aquarium seems done making shrooms, toss it onto damp straw in your yard, in a shady spot, and cover over with just enough soil to hide it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where the huge ones will come up. If it survives and it&amp;#39;s not too cold, and you keep it slightly damp.  Thus the shade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;ll get so much from the jars, you&amp;#39;ll have no shortage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for effects, I can get so much higher without drugs they were mostly just annoying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think most of the &amp;quot;psychonaut&amp;quot; effect is just bad player excitement.  People who&amp;#39;ve been listening to idiots like McKenna, and pretend  they&amp;#39;re on some meaningful exploration of consciousness, by getting high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They ignore that any &amp;quot;raver&amp;quot; kicks their butt for that activity, and they&amp;#39;ve gotten nowhere at all, but perhaps into low paying jobs with poor relationships with other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you want to get really high, just smoke some Salvia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it only lasts 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shrooms are for grateful dead concerts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you go that route, you&amp;#39;ll end up as delusional as Maria Sabina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you still won&amp;#39;t get that deal with Disney.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An alternate method:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find some horse manure that&amp;#39;s been bagged and sterilized. They used to sell it at Lowes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fertilize your whole lawn with it, generously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The neighbors won&amp;#39;t be happy, but the lawn will love it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watch for magic mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get too excited over the Panaeolus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOT hallucinogenic.  Despite what people believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blue meanings is what you&amp;#39;re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if the stem doesn&amp;#39;t turn blue when you pluck that mushroom, it&amp;#39;s just the common panaeolus. At least, in southern Cal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Up north, just find bales of hay outdoors where shrooms are growing.  I think there&amp;#39;s no shortage of shrooms in Washington and Portland.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, an old woman out here used to make growing kits. They sold them at head shops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked how they can get away with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The owner chastised me (wink wink) and said, &amp;quot;Those are for science.  You look at the spores you grow in a microscope, and study the mycelium.  It&amp;#39;s illegal to consume them!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked if the feds minded. She said they were mellowing out on such things, and thought maybe soon shrooms would be entirely legal for all uses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The woman got too old to make the kits, but I can&amp;#39;t imagine there aren&amp;#39;t some around. Complete with spores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you make shrooms, you can make ENDLESS spore prints. Each shroom will make at least 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;#39;ll get hundreds of shrooms from a few 8 ounce mason jars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most small.  But they&amp;#39;re all equal in potency, per dried gram.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_yrdq9e", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yrdq9e/i_am_confused_about_the_smoke_medicine_to_my_best/iw7dxnk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1668352403.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1668352403.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iw55qyd", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Artivist", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1668301938.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ivtz8ei", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4pgwt", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Did the sample you try have any effect?\n\nCan you share how you ended up growing mushroom for the double women?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iw55qyd", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did the sample you try have any effect?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you share how you ended up growing mushroom for the double women?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_yrdq9e", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yrdq9e/i_am_confused_about_the_smoke_medicine_to_my_best/iw55qyd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1668301938.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ivtz8ei", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1668097542.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_yrdq9e", "score": 15, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I sure hope you haven't been reading nonsense from Gordon Wasson!\n\nOr any other \"expert\" on mushrooms.\n\nLet me ask you a serious question here.

So maybe it even grows in Ireland.\n\nJust brew 3 leaves as a tea. That's the most common method here in southern California, where Carlos must have visited every reservation looking for his \"informant\".\n\nAll using datura tea as far as I know.\n\nHe didn't get one, due to UCLA and UCR being just 1 hour drive from all the reservations.  So they were already \"taken\" by the time Carlos started looking. Even in the early 60s.\n\nShamanistic drug rituals were HOT back then.  Less social stigma too.\n\nMy father and Lowell Bean had Morongo at one point. Where Carlos first looked, led by Joanie.\n\nAn anthropologist groupie woman.\n\nIn a humous stalking maneuver, Carlos exposed me to Joanie again 55 years since I last saw her hanging out around my father.  \n\nI had no idea, but Carlos must have been amused. She was living in a little granny cottage to the side of his driveway at Pandora.\n\nHe knew full well who my father was. \n\nHad Bruce come tell me once.\n\nSomeone at one of the reservations much have given Carlos the rumor about there being a man out there (don Juan), which led him to that bus stop where his friend pointed him out.\n\nIgnore the bad player tale that someone knows who that man was. It's more nonsense.   Another wannabe \"the real don Juan\" and his \"disciples\". The disciples are always the actual masterminds of cons like that. As was the case with \"The Buddha\".\n\nIt's actually not so hard to verify that story of Carlos finding don Juan.  At least a little!\n\nFortunately I was skulking around in the background at 12, so it seemed natural that it's a true story to me,  all along.  I heard actual \"shaman sorcerers\" discussing it out at Morongo.  Angry and jealous of course.  Shamanism is NOT actually what we do, but it's an offshoot.\n\nRuby was the first sorceress I met, and she verified where those types of sorcerers had lived.  In the direction Carlos went!\n\nBe careful with the tea, and go study the warnings on google.\n\nTry a tiny dosage at first.  And be sure to wait 2 hours.  And don't get \"happy\", and drink more, when it works. \n\nDump it down the drain instead, so you aren't tempted.\n\nYou can go into a comma, and the dosage from one plant to the next varies wildly.\n\nJust as don Juan said!

So they were already &amp;quot;taken&amp;quot; by the time Carlos started looking. Even in the early 60s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shamanistic drug rituals were HOT back then.  Less social stigma too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father and Lowell Bean had Morongo at one point. Where Carlos first looked, led by Joanie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An anthropologist groupie woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a humous stalking maneuver, Carlos exposed me to Joanie again 55 years since I last saw her hanging out around my father.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no idea, but Carlos must have been amused. She was living in a little granny cottage to the side of his driveway at Pandora.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He knew full well who my father was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had Bruce come tell me once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone at one of the reservations much have given Carlos the rumor about there being a man out there (don Juan), which led him to that bus stop where his friend pointed him out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ignore the bad player tale that someone knows who that man was. It&amp;#39;s more nonsense.   Another wannabe &amp;quot;the real don Juan&amp;quot; and his &amp;quot;disciples&amp;quot;. The disciples are always the actual masterminds of cons like that. As was the case with &amp;quot;The Buddha&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually not so hard to verify that story of Carlos finding don Juan.  At least a little!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately I was skulking around in the background at 12, so it seemed natural that it&amp;#39;s a true story to me,  all along.  I heard actual &amp;quot;shaman sorcerers&amp;quot; discussing it out at Morongo.  Angry and jealous of course.  Shamanism is NOT actually what we do, but it&amp;#39;s an offshoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ruby was the first sorceress I met, and she verified where those types of sorcerers had lived.

Trying to &amp;quot;clean up the mess&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita by the way is a big fan of me now!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what she&amp;#39;s up to, or whether there&amp;#39;s an outside person talking to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems so to me.

Summoning magic from the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She turned the camera towards me and started insulting my clothes.   And said I don&amp;#39;t have enough money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she turned back to her own face as if to confide, and told them I carry my balls around in a white shopping bag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She pointed the phone back at me, and said, &amp;quot;See!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in fact carrying a white shopping bag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she said, &amp;quot;you can go now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yrdq9e/i_am_confused_about_the_smoke_medicine_to_my_best/iwbrlyr/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1668434063.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_yrdq9e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 8, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iwbvaxs", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1668435847.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iwbbmsd", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;I really wish I could have seen your earlier rendition...so sorry it was lost to the aether!\n\nI seem to be \"protected\" at times, by reddit itself.\n\nThat post had too much information about Cholita, and might have put her in danger.\n\nOf course, somehow I didn't save it after finishing it, possibly because I had to check something else on the computer.\n\nBut the window should have warned me if I tried to close it before saving, and didn't.\n\nSo it's still very odd.

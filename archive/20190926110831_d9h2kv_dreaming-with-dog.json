She's 7, her name is Nika. We communicate with her and have been friends for the past two and a half years. We make regular outings with her in parks and squares, morning and evening. And recently something happened - she led me into a dream in reality.\n\nAnd this is what happened:\n\nOnce we walked with her in the park, she was without a leash. I was in a state of inner silence. And suddenly a picture overtook me - I suddenly saw and felt the image of how ancient people used dogs. However, \u201cused\u201d is not the right word, rude and incorrect. I found myself inside a scene that seemed to \u201coverlap\u201d as a parallel reality on what surrounds me. At that moment I was in a distant shady park, an hour's walk from the house. And I saw a vague picture of how I, in a group of dark and short, but strong and dexterous people, go hunting in an ancient deciduous forest. It was not Africa, but perhaps the south of Europe. These are some very ancient times, a couple of tens of thousands of years. There are three of us adult men and one teenager. And with us there are three dogs around the perimeter. And each of our group is silent and focused. We are tracking some large predator. Each of us is weaker than this predator, but together we are a single whole, dogs and people, much stronger than him. We feel - all together, as one, one family, people and dogs, our feelings - in one cloud of feelings. Dogs occupy their line in this hunt, and people occupy their own. And I remember that dogs were no less important to us than our children. We felt them and communicated with them in the same way as with each other. And the dogs nursed and slept hugging with our children and with us. The spirit of mutual partnership was simply unbelievable.\n\nLater, \u201cspinning\u201d my dream, I remembered the additional elements of this dream. I saw that the ancients concluded with the ancestors of modern dogs something like an inter specific agreement beneficial to both. This, of course, was no solemn signing of papers for the crackling of cameras. It was a silent hunting agreement. People in those days were open for cooperation with various and amazing creatures, both organic and inorganic. And to my surprise, I suddenly realized (and my dog \u200b\u200bseemed to show it to me) - that she remembers and fulfills the same ancient agreement with people. Moreover, the loyalty of most dogs, especially the so-called mongrel dogs, whose memory is more preserved, as I could understand, reaches such a level that in itself the implementation of this agreement causes great joy for the dog. Yes, she, of course, is pleased when I stroke or scratch her ear. But nothing can compare with the fullness of her delight when she realizes that we are together on something that she perceives as a hunt-walk.\n\nAnd I must say, this is a great feeling for me and for her. I feel something like an energy rope that binds us together, into one flock. I feel and feel that she perceives and realizes herself as a living tool that expands my boundaries when I go somewhere, and she freely accompanies me, describing intricate circles, exploring space for smell and taste. I give her confidence when meeting strangers (she does not like and is afraid of strangers), and she warns me about everything that is happening around. She filters the dangers and prey, she approaches me when she feels that around is becoming anxious or danger is approaching. We are a pack. And as part of the pack, it claims (deservedly) to share attention, love and food. And gets that share, no doubt.\n\nWhat an amazing feeling it is to feel like a pack! The pack \u201cthinks\u201d and feels collectively, it is connected by sincerest devotion and affection of each to each. The spontaneously arising hierarchy of forces does not cancel love and support.\n\nParticular pleasure arises when we explore unfamiliar spaces with her - just then, our invisible connection with her as the article is the strongest and most distinct. But when we return to the familiar range, which she considers safe and familiar, she leaves me alone. This is no longer a hunt and therefore it is drawn to go about their business.\n\nRussian  [https://www.tensegrity.moscow/dreaming-with-dog/](https://www.tensegrity.moscow/dreaming-with-dog/)\n\nThis is an automatic text translation using Google Translate, so it may contain semantic absurdities and sound strange in English.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "dreaming with dog", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Experiences"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_d9h2kv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_hkde3", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Experiences", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 11, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1569488911.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a dog.

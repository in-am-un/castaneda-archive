I thought I'd write it down just in case it's gone later.\n\nWhen you learn to get silent, you discover that it's hard to keep the internal dialogue off, because you keep forgetting, and it comes back.  This isn't something a beginner would notice, because they're still struggling even to get silent.  It's like a man carrying 100 pounds won't notice that if his knees are bent a tiny bit more, his back feels better. The burden of the weight doesn't allow him to see that fine detail.\n\nIn the past I've written about how to stop the world.  One method is to eliminate the three enemies of freely shifting the assemblage point.\n\nThe first is the internal dialogue.  The second is the flow of images in the mind, which cause the internal dialogue to return.  And the third is \"Mr. DoubleTake\", the virtual little guy in our head who \"cares\" what he perceives.  He censors it if it breaks perceptual customs, and he interferes even when it doesn't.  He is sort of the main enemy of Buddhist \"equanimity\".\n\nHowever, it turns out there's a better way to look at those 3, which offer amazing possibilities of exploration.\n\nFirst and foremost is to get rid of the internal dialogue, which is the source of our obsessions.  With each thought based entirely on words in our mind,  we select the specific intent we want to be active.  We don't realize that but by obsessing over the details of the current world we are assembling, we \"tune it back in\".\n\nI'll avoid explaining. If anyone doesn't find this somewhat obvious, it's a little too advanced for you.\n\nAnd apparently for me too, because the clarity is fading fast.  I'll try to finish quickly.\n\nThe images in the mind that cause the internal dialogue to come back, are none other than intent!\n\nNot the actual helpful, \"force\" of intent, which gifts you.\n\nBut rather, the images are the \"skimings\" of all the emanations available to you, from which you have selected only very specific ones, to form your view of the world.\n\nMost of those skimings are substantial, meaning, you have an entire population of billions, sharing the same skimings (reality).\n\nIn silence, the assemblage point can move.  But as you wait for it to move, you find that images in the mind still cause it to remain where it normally is located.\n\nMostly worries I would assume, but certainly what Carlos called, \"obsessions\", such as sex.\n\nIf you can drop both the internal dialogue, and eliminate the images, the assemblage point starts to slide in seconds.  Not the 2 minutes we've been given as an estimate.  The 2 minutes is the time from silence, to where you can drop the images also.\n\nSo it really only takes seconds, if you can drop both.\n\nNow what about Mr. DoubleTake's part in this?\n\nI have no idea now. It's lost.\n\nSo here's a practical experiment based on the first 2 I can still recall.\n\nPlay with puffs, depositing them on your body, and building the expectation to look a direction and actually see something amazing (a brilliant puff), doing that as continuously as you can.\n\nNaturally, force silence very hard.\n\nEventually you'll notice whitish energy on surfaces.\n\nKeep going, just glancing past the puffs and other \"colors\"  you can still scoop up.\n\nWhen the whitish light takes on texture, you're ready to experiment.\n\nNote: if the whitish light forms another place, go for that instead. Translocation is more valuable than a random experiment.\n\nTake your hand, lift to eye level, and gaze directly at the back of the hand, so that your palm looks like it's \"smoothing off\" the whitish light on the walls. Movce it extremely slowly, like \"Monk\" from the detective show, using his hands to reduce his field of view, so he can concentrate on details.\n\nYour hand against the crusty or line covered whitish light, will cause disturbances in intent.\n\nYou'll visually see these as little dots, circles, bumps, foam, or something that is not yet a \"thing\", but clearly a rather dramatic thing to have formed in the air like that.  If you are very silent and have shifted a bit horizontally (all this takes place at the orange zone), an actual \"object\" may pop out and float just ahead of where your palm is pointed.\n\nIt's a lot like smoothing the blanket on your bed, and finding the TV remote control got under the blankets near the edge.  You could lift the blanket to remove it, or you could keep \"smoothing\" it until the remote popped out at the end.\n\nThat's what you need to be able to do, to understand this next part.\n\nSlide your palm along the whitish light which should have at least a little \"texture\", and make intent disturbances manifest.\n\nNow here's the interesting part. If you can do this in near to perfect silence, you can see that the images in your mind have been so reduced, you can find small moments where neither is present, and you are absolutely blank, or more properly, \"still\".  In that state, you are VERY sensitive to the return of any images.\n\nGaze at the intent disturbance, waiting for it to \"turn into something\".\n\nThis is a potential skimming of the emanations,  to turn them into a \"thing\", but it's not yet fully formed.\n\nAt the instant it forms any recognizable details, intent pops an image into your mind.\n\nYou tuned in a \"real\" piece of intent.\n\nThat word, \"intent' has multiple uses, if you can't follow that last one, you aren't advanced enough to make use of this.  Don't even try, that's sort of like Luke giving in to the dark side.  In our case, to the \"book deal mind\".  To want something other than magic.  Such as the attention of skipping to an advanced technique, to get more from other people.\n\nBut if out can follow that usage of intent, what you will notice when even a single image comes which goes along with the intent disruption, is that it's like a telepathic thought associated with the intent disrruption!\n\nBest to just describe one.  You smooth your hand along the wall very slowly, seeing vertical whitish lines. You uncover a few grey and black bubbles, with white highlights.  As you gaze to see if its a little toy car, or a face, or a piece of a mountain, it starts to  brighten a bit, and you even see a brilliant blue dot on it, for just an instant.\n\nExpectation grows in you (not a bad thing here, it's the positive side of Mr. DoubleTake), and you remember that to get the most vivid thing to form in the air, which is super cool, you have to check your silence again.  You verify you are absolutely silent, then look to see if there are any trace images left.\n\nLike, worry over a bill you didn't pay.  Or a scratch on your car, carved with Cholita's keys.\n\nYou do in fact find a very subtle image, so you drop it.\n\nAnd the intent disruption begins to become something real.  A fire hydrant perhaps!\n\nThe fire hydrant is fully visual. It's right there, floating in the air, just to the left of your hand\n\nAnd an image of sorts starts to arrive. It's not a thought yet.  Not internal dialogue, because you haven't tuned anything in enough yet, to obsess over it.\n\nAnd then, a telepathic thought pops into  your mind.\n\nYou DID NOT think it, and yet, it's a thought so complete, it comes with internal dialogue.\n\nIn this fire hydrant case, the thought might be, \"He entered the building over there,  and his...\"\n\nYou notice that thought, since you've been forcing silence so well, and put a stop to it.\n\nYou return to playing with your intent disruption, not yet realizing what's going on.\n\nBut the fire hydrant is no longer clear, and you even doubt you saw it. With both the internal dialogue removed, and any images suppressed, you continue, and the intent disturbance again starts to form something concrete.\n\nAgain, a telepathic thought, or \"history\" of the newly forming dream world, pops into your mind, looking a lot like internal dialogue.\n\nIt's a piece of the intent of that place!\n\nYou've separated sight from the context or syntax of that forming place or \"thing\".\n\nIt's sort of like waking up in a dream, becoming lucid that is, and you realize, you can still remember what you were doing the last 2 weeks, in that dream.\n\nBut the dream can't be that old!\n\nThe very position of your assemblage point, puts thoughts and memories into your mind!\n\nThey simple, \"Come with the territory\".\n\nOnce you can see that, you can play with the whitish light in many ways.\n\nRemember, the whitish light seen on surfaces, is  the \"famous, \"Seeing energy\" that every social media bad player likes to lie about, and claim to be able to do it.\n\nExcept you really are. And when you are \"seeing energy\",  you are scanning for intent.  You're waiting for skimings of the emanations to form something new for you.  If you are early books obsessed for example, you're waiting for don Juan to pull the memory of the button nosed boy out of thin air, so you can lord it over Carlos and get attention for yourself.\n\nSorry to keep returning to bad player criticisms, but in fact that's the obsession of the community, as far as their understanding of seeing goes. Seeing is for pulling pranks on others. Impressive magical pranks.\n\nBut most of the time, seeing pulls up the proverbial rabbit with buck teeth, like the one Carlos saw don Juan manifest.\n\nSomething random, and mostly meaningless.\n\nYou can play around with intent and learn more about it, using this technique of \"smoothing the whitish light, to skim phantom intent.\"\n\nNow, if you successfully get objects or bits of scenes to pop out of the whitish light, and then telepathically put the context or history of that thing into your internal dialogue (not induced by you at all), then  you can have a whole bunch of fun!\n\nIf you have an IOB, it's going to be irresistible to them.  When a little head appears to take a look, scoop it into your hand.  Then use your favorite technique to keep it in the hand. I like to \"blow it away\", then \"inhale it back\". Meaning, push and pull on it, while watching the face.\n\nWhen it gets brighter, you are in business.\n\nIf you don't have an IOB (sad), you'll simply have to double the intent disturbances you control, by smoothing one into your left hand too.  A substitute for an IOB.\n\nGlancing at it in your left hand from time to time, locate another intent disturbance in the air, using your right hand.  Put them close together, like 6 inches\n\nHard part is not losing the view of either.\n\nThe intent disturbance is perhaps only 5% formed. It's just some weird lines and bubbles, with a few twinkling dots on the edges.\n\nNot well enough formed, to transmit a telepathic concept of the intent it represents.\n\nThe other hand has a visible inorganic being's head.  That has 50% well formed intent.\n\nIf you are lucky, your IOB has figured out what's up, and has formed itself to 90%, by perhaps putting on a weird hat, and smoking a cigarette.\n\nDon't assume all of that is you.  IOBs do have \"attitude\", and that little touch is their interpretation of what might make you think they are \"cool\".\n\nGently insert the IOB into the forming intent disruption, and look for the telepathic echo.\n\nDo this over and over again, and you'll eventually move the assemblage point so far (which direction, I don't know) that you won't be able to remember it more than a few seconds.\n\nThe problem with phantom skimings is, there's not enough there to remembered later on, when you can't visually see them anymore.\n\nBut if you move the assemblage point so far using that technique, that nothing any longer is certain (because you've been swapping intent too much), you reach the state Carlos described in his \"Six Propositions'\", from Eagle's Gift.\n\nYou're fixation of intent is broken.\n\nYou will be rejected from the intent of this world, and find  yourself somewhere else.\n\nWith people you know.\n\nThe fixation of their intent on that place, becomes a safe harbor for you, when the intent of this world rejects you.\n\nPossibly that's why Carolos advised his  private class, when you die, \"come find me and I'll show you which way to go!\"\n\nIt wasn't that he's \"holding a bridge open\".  I'm not sure who started that rumor.  What a burden they place on Carlos!\n\nSaving all of Spain perhaps?  What's worth saving in Spain, if you can't bring the wine and Tapas?\n\n(A joke, based on the likely fraudulent claims of a Spanish group mentioned by someone in here a half a year or so back.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Internal Dialogue, Images in Mind, and Mr. DoubleTake", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_mh1y35", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1617183226.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1617181130.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I plan to do an image of how to make use of what I&amp;#39;m explaining here, but it&amp;#39;s one of those things you &amp;quot;discover&amp;quot; in the dark room, which can be hard to comprehend later on.

That has 50% well formed intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are lucky, your IOB has figured out what&amp;#39;s up, and has formed itself to 90%, by perhaps putting on a weird hat, and smoking a cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t assume all of that is you.  IOBs do have &amp;quot;attitude&amp;quot;, and that little touch is their interpretation of what might make you think they are &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gently insert the IOB into the forming intent disruption, and look for the telepathic echo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do this over and over again, and you&amp;#39;ll eventually move the assemblage point so far (which direction, I don&amp;#39;t know) that you won&amp;#39;t be able to remember it more than a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with phantom skimings is, there&amp;#39;s not enough there to remembered later on, when you can&amp;#39;t visually see them anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you move the assemblage point so far using that technique, that nothing any longer is certain (because you&amp;#39;ve been swapping intent too much), you reach the state Carlos described in his &amp;quot;Six Propositions&amp;#39;&amp;quot;, from Eagle&amp;#39;s Gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re fixation of intent is broken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will be rejected from the intent of this world, and find  yourself somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With people you know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fixation of their intent on that place, becomes a safe harbor for you, when the intent of this world rejects you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Possibly that&amp;#39;s why Carolos advised his  private class, when you die, &amp;quot;come find me and I&amp;#39;ll show you which way to go!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t that he&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;holding a bridge open&amp;quot;.

And my hand feels it too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we produce &amp;quot;skimmings&amp;quot; of emanations which are legal in this world, and consider the others &amp;quot;invalid&amp;quot;, until finally,  we completely block them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you start paying attention, they uncover again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You only have to gaze to the bottom of the pond a few times, before they float back up to the surface, along with everything else that&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;allowed&amp;quot; to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had somewhat of a disadvantage with the teachers we had. Carols and the witches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan&amp;#39;s lineage had taught 15 apprentices.  And they&amp;#39;d been taught by 15 different teachers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They &lt;strong&gt;knew&lt;/strong&gt; how to teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos and the witches taught none.  At least, none successfully enough for them to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, they&amp;#39;d already pulled everything up from the bottom of their own pond, long ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s better to have someone teaching who still remembers what it was like before it surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason":

Your mind likes to track objects as they move past you when you&amp;#39;re doing this, to help you keep your balance and determine how fast you are going. If you pretend you are doing this in the absence of visuals, the hypnagogia will kick in and create them for you. Then you just ride your imaginary bike into the scene without worrying too much about that pesky transition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_mh1y35", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mh1y35/internal_dialogue_images_in_mind_and_mr_doubletake/gtfnsq4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1617612956.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1617612956.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gsxsoml", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gsxl5q3", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "You could literally learn to do that.\n\nBut it's too much work to be worth it.\n\nIt's sort of what the \"Men of Knowledge\" did.

Must have clicked that while trying to keep the screen from zooming when I didn't want it to.\n\nBut it turns out, we're missing important things.\n\nUnbending Intent Long Form scoops puffs of energy onto your 3 pouches.\n\nThe result is visible in the orange zone as a \"puff body\".\n\nAs it turns out, this is actually the double clinging to our physical body like a baby in one of those front side baby carriers made out of cloth.\n\nAnd it fully agrees with Olmec statues, besides the shape shifted into a Jaguar detail.   Which by the way is not universal.  There are olmec figurines where the double is both shapeshifted and not shapeshifted, on the front. There's also on the  back but I have none so far, shapeshifted on the back.  On the back, it's upside down\n\nThat's 3 conditions.  Shapeshifted in front, not shapeshifted in front, and upside down, not shape shifted, on back.\n\nIn the front, the double can be held with hands, or resting on lap.\n\nI've seen both in the darkroom.  I know this frustrates beginners,  but these things become fully visible.  Even if you never saw those  statues, you'd see those sights.\n\nSo here's the first thing that could use research:\n\nIs the one on the back always upside down, and not shapeshifted?\n\nSecond research topic: Why is the one in the front sometimes held?  Is that a threat that it's about to be unleashed?  Sent away?\n\nAgain, beginners might be confused on this.  We REALLY do these things so the fine details of sculptures from our past \"sages\" are clues to super cool abilities.\n\nFor instance, it's very normal to break the rules of physics in the darkroom.   Reaching behind a wall is common. Seeing a third arm has happened to more than 1.\n\nIf there are different configurations, we need to figure them out.  We lost Carlos, and Carol doesn't seem inclined to explain such details.\n\nBut here's what's bothering me right now.\n\nThe tensegrity contains another configuration.  The double to your front, not attached.\n\nAnd mobile!\n\nIt's the \"Gift to Maui\" pass.  You strike in the air in front of you, to form a \"frame\" for the energy body.\n\n(Side topic: Is \"gift to\" in the name of a new pass, a sign of something from Carlos?)\n\nI believe the same Maui pass, or series of passes has you form an energy ball on the floor, and watch it rise up into space.\n\nWe pretty much know now, those energy balls are your own awareness inside your shell, pushed to the outside, but gathered back with tensegrity.\n\nSo that ball you project up into space, is either your double, or a connection to the double.\n\nWe also know from our own experiences, the balls of energy can contain visions, inorganic being manifestations, can be collected into piles in front of you and will take on an inhabitant, and can be directional, or non-directional.\n\nAnd when projected out, you can go along as if it were you!\n\nTrust me when I say, if you leap into outerspace, headed for a planet circling another star, you will not be telling yourself, \"This isn't real!\"\n\nInstead, you'll be asking yourself it it's going to hurt when you land.  You must be traveling more than 100,000 miles per second to get to another planet that fast!\n\nDon't worry, you slow down at the end.  But in fact, yes.  It does hurt.\n\nThe puffs of your own awareness can also be thrown, resulting in an amazing blast in your darkroom, or merely in illumination that reveals other things around you.\n\nThey're clearly mobile, and multi-purpose. And the tensegrity is our main info on how to use them.\n\nWhat I'm curious about, are other passes which treat the energy body like a \"frame\".\n\nSomeone posted one in chat.  A woman was poking the air in front of her with her finger.  In the same pass she was striking in the air to form a little frame, just like Maui pass.\n\nShe pretty much \"activated\" or \"pierced\" something, and gave it it's own shape, or frame, into which to concentrate.\n\nHow many passes deal with just the energy body?  Are there some which place it on the back, like the Olmec figurines?\n\nI vaguely recall Taisha has a pass which puts the energy body on the ground, like a puddle of water, and she poked it also.\n\nWhy do we poke it in some passes?  Is projecting it up into space like poking it?  A way to get it to start moving out from us?\n\nLet's not be dull like the Chi Gung folks, who don't actually expect any of what they do to be true or usable.   It's pretty sad if you think about it.  All that pretending, and yet, all that anger if you point it out.\n\nWhen it gets down to it, humans are creatures of inventory and social heiarachy, and most \"systems\" do nothing but appeal to those two anti-sorcery tendancies.  The very systems are designed to destroy any possibility of real magic, substituting complicated inventories, and a desire to rise to the top, so you can lord it over others with your inventory.\n\nThat's one reason it's so horrible to try to battle these tendancies.  Even the sincerely minded among us, will turn rabid when their play for power in the social heirachy of a system (especially buddhism) comes under fire.  Even wanting to learn about sorcery, their aspirations to be powerful in a crummy human organization like the buddhist church, will drive them mad when challenged.\n\nWe also get Daoist inventory experts who have secret plans to modify what Castaneda gave them, so they can remarket it as something else, and cash in.\n\nLike, take delusional Chinese mysticism regarding imaginary energies and try to \"speed up\" a new form of darkroom.  We already have someone trying to do that!  Naturally, they tend to revert back to closed eyed, so they can pretend that falling asleep and having a nightmare is success.\n\nFrankly, no one expects any of this to work.\n\nBut in fact, those Olmec statues show you to run out from  your physical body as a jaguar.  Or to go out scouting like a probe, in other worlds, for the sake of your tonal body.  Or to borrow the sensory talents (such as the eyes) of the double.\n\nThe Olmecs had no raason to make up stuff.  They didn't even have money! There was no way to set up a youtube channel and try to con people with your \"chi gung\".\n\nIn our case, no one emphasized those very real super powers you can learn, when we were taught those moves. Likely it was because if you really practice, those abilities manifest and you get the thrill of discovering them.\n\nDon Juan gave us the heads up on that proper teaching technique, when he refused to tell Carlos all the different types of inorganic beings.\n\nIf don Juan had been Chinese, he'd not oniy have had long lists of types of inorganic beings, but he'd have drown them up on little scrolls, so he could tell them at the temple.  And Genaro would have made little Japanese style \"collectables\" of each.\n\nI have dibs on Little smoke if we do that.  I picture her as being like Pikachu.  In colletable form only, of course.  Maybe that scout under the werejaguar in that statue I posted yesterday. That creature looked like  it was having fun.\n\nIf he were Chinese, don Juan would have had more books than Miguel, on the types of inorganic beings.\n\nIn Eastern systems, they are up to their ears in \"facts\" about what stuff does, without it ever actually doing any of it.  Because that takes work, which you don't need to do, in order to sell stuff to new people.\n\nThey have inventories of magical facts, but no magic.  It's all just bad player tricks to get money, passed down over **thousands** of years until people forget it was just bad guy \"Bob\" trying to cash in on something a real sorcerer could do.\n\nIt's as if the Miguels, Victors, and Kens, won out with their pretend magic.\n\nAnd over time it grew so large, no one dares to point out the obvious.\n\nIt's all a fraud.\n\nWe have one chance here not to have that happen to magic again.\n\nAnd the double is the key to the best magic we have.\n\nWe should reexamine Tensegrity from that point of view.  How it uses the double.\n\nBut more so, specifically what happens when you use it like that.  Not pretending like Asian systems.\n\nBut for real, what happens?\n\nIn my case, the double of Cholita has physically touched me, and I've chased her through solid walls, and across multiple continents.\n\nFully awake.\n\nIf we aren't careful, we'll end up with a crummy inventory system too, and forget that those techniquees are supposed to teach you the \"real magic\" part, not enable you to design your own greedy workshops so you can sell used inventory to people who aren't actually interested in making it work.\n\nCan anyone think of more Tensegrity with manipulation of the double's body shape and location?\n\nWhat we really need at this point, is the facilitators.\n\nA video showing these things about the double, and how tensegrity forms it, would put the idea into their minds.\n\nOne of these days we need to invade Youtube.\n\nIf we want to consider recruiting methods, that's probably the Holy Grail.\n\nAdvice from animators is also sought here.  How to make youtube video presentations with cartoons of these things?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Energy Body Location In Tensegrity?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_rnn48i", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1640357294.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1640355114.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need some research!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the nsfw rating, I&amp;#39;m on crummy keyboard laptop.

As punishment for not video taping all of the passes, the night I learned each one.\n\nIt wasn't impossible to do that back then.\n\nBut now we don't have anyone else who could \"fix\" them, other than Nyei or Reni.\n\nMaybe zazzy could?\n\nOtherwise, I don't know anyone who still practices, and learned all of them.\n\nWhich reminds me of something even weirder than usual.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to describe.\n\nThe Tensegrity forms \"modify\" your reality.\n\nCarlos said he wanted to \"saturate us\".\n\nAnd I certainly got saturated.  I've seen a few forms discussed recently, only to realize I had copied one of the movements, for my own purposes in the dark room.\n\nI didn't recall the pass. But when I needed to use my hand or leg in a certain way, I ended up using the pass.\n\nBut I didn't realize, he wanted to \"saturate\" us with some odd form of \"nagual energy\".\n\nI don't know how else to describe it.\n\nThe tensegrity moves, done over and over, create nagual energy.\n\nIn multi-dimensional space around you.\n\nIt's like how you do re-runs.\n\nOr switch to a cyclic being.\n\nYou're in absolute silence, very near to stopping the world.\n\nAnd you get an urge to look to the left, and slightly down.\n\nAs if a little voice was located there and saying, \"Hey idiot, look down here.\"\n\nBut it's not a voice you can hear consciously.\n\nYou only know it was \"pulling\" on you, when your head turns all by itself.\n\nAnd the instant it aligns with that precise point in space, you find yourself inside a dream.\n\nBut it's not an ordinary dream. For one thing, you went in there fully awake, with your eyes open.\n\nAnd are still awake inside the dream. And can turn  your head back, and return to where you came from.\n\nFully awake the entire time, and never without full lucidity.\n\nNot a dream at all. \n\nIt can be several things.\n\nOne is an actual re-run of the past, through someone else's eyes.\n\nYou could find yourself being La Gorda, at the bus station on the way down to don Juan's home, where the Yaqui wars ended.\n\nBack from a visit up north, headed to their compound.\n\nOr you could find you are an entirely different person, with a spouse, living in a relatively nice home.  With all the memories of a different person.\n\nThat's a cyclic being.  We have access to around 600 of those.\n\nNow, here's what the Tensegrity seems to do.\n\nIt creates a structure like that in space.  A structure that can \"pull\" on  you.\n\nSo maybe a specific pass creates a structure 8 feet away, 2 feet to the right, shaped like a fat T on it's side, tall enough to stand up on it's own and equal your head height.\n\nIgnore the shape, I just wanted to point out, it has a 3D shape and is a \"usable\" size.  Maybe it's closer to a giant mushroom.\n\nIt's saturated with a connection to something else.\n\nSomething I always assume must be that mystical \"nagual\" part of us.\n\nIf you truly \"saturated\" yourself with tensegrity passes,  then in full on heightened awareness you could see the effect of each, as some kind of connection to the Nagual.\n\nOr another analogy.\n\nOur existence is a flat barren surface right now.\n\nOur society has cropped off all other possibilities.\n\nWe have to live our dreary lives filled with self-pity, because there's absolutely nothing else we could focus on.\n\nThey've left some stale donuts to amuse us, like \"happily ever after\", \"Soul Mate\",  or \"Family is everything\".\n\nHappily ever after donuts have the colored sprinkles.\n\nTo figure out those aren't what was promised takes your whole life.  And by then you're too tired to fix the situation, so you brainwash the grandchildren to repeat your mistakes.\n\nSociety smiles when they see the loving grand parent, and how beloved they are.\n\nBut in fact, they're the darkest of the dark magicians.  They know what they're doing!  But they do it anyway.\n\nSo there you are right now, standing on the barren soil of the blue line reality, with nothing magical to see in any direction.\n\nMaybe you even amuse yourself by attacking others who might have found some crummy plant growing in the barren soil.\n\nLike today's visitor asking why we take our dream symbols so literally.\n\nWe found a wilty, misshapen little flower growing in the hard soil of our prearranged reality, and he's squatting down next to it, criticizing us for taking it seriously.\n\nHey, it's all there is!\n\nBut each tensegrity pass is like mushroom spores.  You do the form enough, and some spores settle on the barren dirt, and eventually mushrooms grow there.\n\nLike the ones in Alice in Wonderland.\n\nIf you do all of the passes over and over, you're living in Fairy land for all the mushroom patches you could visit.\n\nCarlos \"implanted\" magic in us, without making it clear that's what he was doing.\n\nBut, we sort of knew that!  He sort of said so when we started learning.\n\nAll the Zombie Castaneda fans out there, claiming to be on the path because they do 20 minutes of Tensegrity on some days, and did recap last  year,  are slowly being surrounded by shroom patches.\n\nBut they do so little, I suspect the patches dry up fast and nothing is noticeable as a result.\n\nThis is the best I can do to explain that.\n\nOne of you will be able to ***see*** it someday. Maybe you can describe it better to me.\n\nFor me it's like being in Disneyland for 10 hours, and your friend asks if you noticed that they changed the uniforms on the jungle cruise attendants.\n\nMaybe...  Probably.\n\nBut I couldn't tell you about it at this point.  Too much park, all in one day.", "edited": 1640805195.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hqfyatp", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some reason, it didn&amp;#39;t occur to me those are also included.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did in fact learn all of the passes from Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I hope, it wasn&amp;#39;t part of some evil plan by the spirit, that I have to fix the broken versions 25 years later.

But when I needed to use my hand or leg in a certain way, I ended up using the pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;#39;t realize, he wanted to &amp;quot;saturate&amp;quot; us with some odd form of &amp;quot;nagual energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how else to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity moves, done over and over, create nagual energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In multi-dimensional space around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like how you do re-runs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or switch to a cyclic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re in absolute silence, very near to stopping the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you get an urge to look to the left, and slightly down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if a little voice was located there and saying, &amp;quot;Hey idiot, look down here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not a voice you can hear consciously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You only know it was &amp;quot;pulling&amp;quot; on you, when your head turns all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the instant it aligns with that precise point in space, you find yourself inside a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not an ordinary dream. For one thing, you went in there fully awake, with your eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And are still awake inside the dream. And can turn  your head back, and return to where you came from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fully awake the entire time, and never without full lucidity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a dream at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can be several things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One is an actual re-run of the past, through someone else&amp;#39;s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could find yourself being La Gorda, at the bus station on the way down to don Juan&amp;#39;s home, where the Yaqui wars ended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back from a visit up north, headed to their compound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you could find you are an entirely different person, with a spouse, living in a relatively nice home.  With all the memories of a different person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a cyclic being.  We have access to around 600 of those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, here&amp;#39;s what the Tensegrity seems to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It creates a structure like that in space.  A structure that can &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; on  you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So maybe a specific pass creates a structure 8 feet away, 2 feet to the right, shaped like a fat T on it&amp;#39;s side, tall enough to stand up on it&amp;#39;s own and equal your head height.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ignore the shape, I just wanted to point out, it has a 3D shape and is a &amp;quot;usable&amp;quot; size.  Maybe it&amp;#39;s closer to a giant mushroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s saturated with a connection to something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something I always assume must be that mystical &amp;quot;nagual&amp;quot; part of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you truly &amp;quot;saturated&amp;quot; yourself with tensegrity passes,  then in full on heightened awareness you could see the effect of each, as some kind of connection to the Nagual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or another analogy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our existence is a flat barren surface right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our society has cropped off all other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have to live our dreary lives filled with self-pity, because there&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing else we could focus on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve left some stale donuts to amuse us, like &amp;quot;happily ever after&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Soul Mate&amp;quot;,  or &amp;quot;Family is everything&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happily ever after donuts have the colored sprinkles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To figure out those aren&amp;#39;t what was promised takes your whole life.  And by then you&amp;#39;re too tired to fix the situation, so you brainwash the grandchildren to repeat your mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Society smiles when they see the loving grand parent, and how beloved they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, they&amp;#39;re the darkest of the dark magicians.  They know what they&amp;#39;re doing!  But they do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there you are right now, standing on the barren soil of the blue line reality, with nothing magical to see in any direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you even amuse yourself by attacking others who might have found some crummy plant growing in the barren soil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like today&amp;#39;s visitor asking why we take our dream symbols so literally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We found a wilty, misshapen little flower growing in the hard soil of our prearranged reality, and he&amp;#39;s squatting down next to it, criticizing us for taking it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, it&amp;#39;s all there is!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But each tensegrity pass is like mushroom spores.  You do the form enough, and some spores settle on the barren dirt, and eventually mushrooms grow there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the ones in Alice in Wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do all of the passes over and over, you&amp;#39;re living in Fairy land for all the mushroom patches you could visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos &amp;quot;implanted&amp;quot; magic in us, without making it clear that&amp;#39;s what he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, we sort of knew that!  He sort of said so when we started learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the Zombie Castaneda fans out there, claiming to be on the path because they do 20 minutes of Tensegrity on some days, and did recap last  year,  are slowly being surrounded by shroom patches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they do so little, I suspect the patches dry up fast and nothing is noticeable as a result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the best I can do to explain that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of you will be able to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; it someday. Maybe you can describe it better to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me it&amp;#39;s like being in Disneyland for 10 hours, and your friend asks if you noticed that they changed the uniforms on the jungle cruise attendants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe...  Probably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I couldn&amp;#39;t tell you about it at this point.

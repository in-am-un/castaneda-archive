You CAN hold up your double...\n\nI posted about that! \n\nSo the old seers weren't being symbolic.  Just gloating perhaps.\n\nYou can even \"experiment\" with him. Like a lab animal.\n\nI must admit, I didn't notice those obvious Tensegrity hand positions.\n\nI suppose I got distracted by the werejaguar aspects.\n\nShapeshifting seems likely to me, to be just changing over to your double.\n\nBut unlike sleeping dreaming, it comes with a heavy dose of Tonal reasoning.\n\nBecause you aren't asleep!\n\nIf that makes any sense (it doesn't).\n\nBut you don't have enough Tonal rationality to be \"smart\".\n\nJust enough to remember it all the next day.\n\nSo that begs the question, that \"blue ball of energy\" that the new seers prefer,  relates to shapeshifting how?\n\nThat's their preferred alternative form,  to our physical body.\n\nBecause it's \"impersonal\".\n\nThere's so much we don't know.\n\nBut worse, we don't even notice we don't know it!  Everyone is so busy trying to steal and trick others, that they don't have time to try to understand the books in any detail.\n\nFor beginners, you start doing truly \"impossible\" things down in the red zone.\n\nThat's where you leave the meditation folks behind in the dust.\n\nNot that you didn't up in the green zone, since we do that with our eyes open!\n\nBut down in the red zone, there's super weird stuff like shapeshifting.\n\nJust don't expect to notice it unless you go outside, and find you can lift a car in one hand.\n\nWhich won't impress you as much as it ought to.\n\nLast time I shape shifted I was more concerned with whether Cholita knew in advance, and put some obstacles in my path just to make fun of me.\n\nSo that's one \"strange thing\" that brings into question what exactly is that \"blue ball of energy\" thing?\n\nThe thing you're building by stuffing puffs!\n\nIf anyone wants to know how to shapeshift, there's a post for that.\n\nWon't be what you expected!  We don't have someone to \"introduce\" us.\n\nTo make a perfect crow for example, you need someone who's also made a perfect crow.\n\nOur lineage seems to know crow, fly, wolf(ish), and possibly bats.\n\nBecause Nyei goes batty on Youtube...\n\nSo with no teachers, we have to use our Ally for an \"introduction\".\n\nAnd  they don't care how messed up  you are.\n\nThat would be like an Alien from another galaxy, caring that you didn't form a perfect Squirrel.\n\nIt's all alien life to them!  What's the difference?\n\nAfter shapeshifting, the next \"odd\" thing occurs when your ally opens a doorway for you.\n\nOr a window.\n\nAnd stands there indicating you are welcome to enter.\n\nRight through your solid bedroom wall!\n\nAgain, you're \"daffy\" at that point. Because of horizontal shifting.\n\nI suspect it means you shifted VERY far horizontally, with the assemblage point near the bottom of the back.\n\n\"The Shift Below\".\n\nSo while you ought to see a window form on your wall, which has no window, and think, \"Holy Shit!!!  This is totally amazing!  I've got to tell my Mom.\"\n\nInstead you're wondering , \"How's the weather out there?\"\n\nWhat??????\n\nBut that's what happens.  I think that when the assemblage point shifts horizontally enough to break the laws of physics, likely it's like being lucid in a dream.\n\nWhere you realize, you know the entire history of that dream, going back years.\n\nEven though the dream can't be older than a half hour.  At the most.\n\nAnd yet if you ask yourself, \"In this dream, what do I do for a living?\"\n\nYou'll know!!!  You drive an ice cream truck.\n\nI didn't say it was a good dream...\n\nIt's like that when your Ally makes his first \"offer\" for you to break all reasonable expectations about reality.\n\nHere's a window, go ahead.\n\nJump into another world.\n\nLet me say, for the sake of the Astral Travel deluded, we DON'T do things with our eyes closed.\n\nFalling asleep, and then lying about an ordinary dream.\n\nIf you like Astral Travel, you're screwed. No one seems to recover from that ego delusion.\n\nIf you only dabbled, then just keep it to yourself.  No one will be the wiser.\n\nI suppose it's like going to a hotel with a beautiful woman you met in a bar, and the next day you realize it was a man.\n\nJust don't tell.  And hopefully no one will ask.\n\nSo fully awake, drinking a double shot espresso in a can, you see the window is open and in fact the weather out there looks fine!  You can even feel a gentle breeze blowing into the room.\n\nI'm not sure why you don't notice the weird South American Indian with the big nose, standing next to the window.\n\nLike I said, you're officially \"daffy\".\n\nBut fully awake.  You could stop and do anything you can ordinarily do fully awake.\n\nEven turn on the TV to watch \"Gilligan's Island\".\n\nAnother thing to keep to yourself I suppose...\n\nBut instead you ignore the Indian guy with the big nose (your ally), and leap right out the window into an alien landscape.\n\nWhere you remain for HOURS.\n\nFully lucid!  No danger at all of losing lucidity because in fact, you're still awake.\n\nHow?\n\nI have no idea...\n\nIt's just what happens at the red zone.\n\nAnd STILL you aren't in your \"blue ball of energy\" body, the preferred form of the snobby new seers.\n\nThey wouldn't be caught dead in a Gargantua form!\n\nThat looks like this, and is VERY easy to assume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13ehw5k6b67a1.png?width=633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9454f5a54d7720925a7505a17bd44d9963b8e2c0\n\nI could keep going from here, but the mysteries only mount up.

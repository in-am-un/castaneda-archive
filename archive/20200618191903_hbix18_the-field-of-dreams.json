Only Cholita being in the next room stopped me.\n\nAnd if there\u2019s a gullible Jedi nearby when you shout it, as there was in this picture, you might lure him to the dark side with such a claim.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do to you.\n\nLure you to the dark side.\n\nA dark room that is.\n\nAnd silence, or there's no point to it.\n\nJust stop playing with your midichlorians, and get to work!\n\nYou\u2019ll be very glad you did.\n\nTwo nights ago I had fully realized, the goal is simply to move to heightened awareness every day.\n\nYou can\u2019t stop, until your breath changes. You have to get to the automatic breathing and bliss level.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t, you don\u2019t stop. Once you get there, you can stop if you feel like it.\n\nTo accomplish this, you have to start earlier at night, so there's at least 12 hours until you have to get up.\n\nIn doing so daily, the assemblage point becomes very stable at all the in-between positions.\n\nAnd you get to keep heightened awareness part of the next day.\n\nExcept that, you can get stuck.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like to get stuck in heightened awareness?\n\nWell forget about sleeping. It\u2019s not possible. You\u2019re already asleep.\n\nBut it won\u2019t bother you that you don\u2019t become unconscious.\n\nSo if you\u2019re trying to sleep anyway, laying on your side with eyes closed, you eventually have to give up, and just go exploring that way.\n\nPerhaps dreaming counts as sleep?\n\nSo you try to go into a dream, but realize, you\u2019ve been watching Cholita and Minx in their own dream for quite a while.\n\nOddly, the entire dream is green color.\n\nAnd Cholita can\u2019t seem to figure out if Minx is a son, or a lover.\n\nLooks more like a needy dog to me, endlessly following her around hoping for a treat.\n\nBut I\u2019m still unclear about what Minx really is.\n\nWhat it\u2019s like to be stuck in heightened awareness if you\u2019re are sitting up with your eyes open,  is a little like being in a crowded restaurant with picnic tables instead of booths.\n\nSitting at the table, you can look down at what you\u2019re eating.\n\nOr you can look around and see what the others are doing. Each table is a little island all to itself.\n\nAnd even when looking down, you can\u2019t help but see all the other things going on, out of the corners of your eyes.\n\nIt\u2019s like a field of dreams! You can focus on your own dream, but all around you are other choices.\n\nThat\u2019s where I found myself last night.\n\nI was standing on flat sand. On the west wall of my bedroom was a dark range of low hills.\n\nI could see it in absolute detail. It was as clear as being outside, looking at a real range of low hills, in a full moon.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t anything blocking me from walking into there.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the head of my bed was in the way, but the hills were at a different level. At that level, walking into there was possible.\n\nI turned my head south, and there was the inside of a huge cave. Inorganic beings were stuck to the inside wall, changing to bizarre shapes to try to lure me to come play.\n\nI wasn\u2019t interested in either choice, so I turned and sat on the bed, facing south.\n\nFairy floated in. She\u2019d taken the form of a grown woman, but only the head was visible. She wasn\u2019t tilted a bit as she usually is. Her head was perfectly upright, and she was looking into my eyes.\n\nI tried to put my hands on each side of her head, and she smiled. So I gently set her down, lowered my hands, and she formed the rest of her body. She lay back and remained there watching.\n\nI believe that what had happened yesterday was, I had gotten through the Crystalline Dreaming Fog. It had been blocking me from travel for a few days.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/b328lespwb551.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04f42ec223c6ba1fefee006f2102c7bd94d60099](https://preview.redd.it/b328lespwb551.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04f42ec223c6ba1fefee006f2102c7bd94d60099)\n\nHaving passed through the dreaming fog, I found myself in Emilito\u2019s favorite place.\n\nThe space between worlds.\n\nThat thought even occurred to me at the time, so I looked around for the bank of fog.\n\nI didn\u2019t find one, but in each direction was another world I could walk to, if I felt like standing up.\n\nFairy was looking so relaxed, I decided to just reach out and pull things over to me.\n\nUsing my outstretched right arm, with the palm facing in, I slowly scooped the air to see what I could gather up.\n\nMy arm was stretched far to my right, and a little back when I started the scoop. I recommend a good stretch when redeploying energy.\n\nThere\u2019s usually more out there, where you don\u2019t normally reach.\n\nEach very very slow sweep of my hand condensed into a bright purple blob the size of a baseball, which then lit on fire in a blue color and burned into a dreaming scene.\n\nThe scene didn\u2019t form right away. Only a bright shape formed, with speckles of light and dark.\n\nAs I puzzled over what that might be, the details filled in.\n\nIt was just potential *intent*, until I added my own.\n\nI was able to pull the dreaming scene to the front of me, in order not to be strained. I wanted to see if the dream could remain stable, after being moved to a convenient location.\n\nSome were, some were not. When one started to fade as I pushed it along, I was able to back up and restore the lost details.\n\nI found a stable scene with a woman and a man sitting on a couch. The man had very dark black shoes.\n\nI grabbed the middle of the dream, to see if it was possible to expand it and enter.\n\nIt was! Just pull it apart, like you're swiping an imagine a cellphone, to make it bigger.\n\nI pulled it out as far as I could with my arms, and lowered them to see the results.\n\nThere were his black shoes down on the floor, right in front of me.\n\nAnd the color of the woman\u2019s clothes was intact.\n\nThe rest was a big blurry, but it was still a success.\n\nBut the couch was rather shabby.  I guess they were poor.\n\nI found and pushed at least 20 dreams around.\n\nI tried making them into a sphere, as I had posted a while back.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/x4f5y35aqsz41.jpg?width=1700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1e947bed5b9bf77310ad0ee90736a8ebcce93bd](https://preview.redd.it/x4f5y35aqsz41.jpg?width=1700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1e947bed5b9bf77310ad0ee90736a8ebcce93bd)\n\nIt still worked.\n\nAlong with that much power, gained by practicing 4 hours a day for a while, I also had a tremor in my lip.\n\nI guess there are side effects to unlimited power.\n\nAs I recall, Silvio Manuel had the same problem, so it must be normal.\n\nAnd looking it up I found, Zuleica had the same tremor in her lower lip.  \n\nI practice Zuleica's techniques almost exclusively.\n\nAnd although the side effect seems to provide additional proof Carlos didn't make up Zuleica, I suppose you couldn't go around pointing at  your quivering lower lip, to prove to people that sorcery is real.\n\nEdited three times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Field of Dreams", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"60vwe8umcp551": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/60vwe8umcp551.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fa2fa887db6b22b379f0bb984edbf13019a183e"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/60vwe8umcp551.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e00b5fd57ffc3b5b4b8591722511397e3eff24d"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/60vwe8umcp551.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b965185fee6f861b0c00919fd944d2027f70efc8"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/60vwe8umcp551.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21a1202d928a5690d2d1db953aa2284e3f469960"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/60vwe8umcp551.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31258e8ec48ce447eec492ed306b3501bb03de82"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/60vwe8umcp551.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5deda0be83bfb2029957efa1144bcb28bbe0af9"}], "s": {"y": 864, "x": 1536, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/60vwe8umcp551.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4dc4e0f9ea838dc09e438a6c1f704cf81e97a8c"}, "id": "60vwe8umcp551"}}, "name": "t3_hbix18", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 13, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/A4uY0jJ626UjaKNIZF4FOLY7M4YVvVmbqd_obLGUHKs.jpg", "edited": 1592602960.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1592500743.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/60vwe8umcp551.jpg?width=1536&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d4dc4e0f9ea838dc09e438a6c1f704cf81e97a8c\"&gt;The Field of Dreams Feels like Unlimited Power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you tired of trying to form your own Tensegrity group, so you can be the wise leader?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you tired of walking around all day reminding yourself that you\u2019re an impeccable Toltec warrior?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you given up fantasies about finding your own lineage to kiss up to?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If so, try the field of dreams!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s UNLIMITED POWER.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, it\u2019s really not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But like Palpatine, you might feel like shouting that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I certainly did last night.

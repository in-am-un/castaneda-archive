I returned the books as a gesture to the universe.  I was in my late 20s, I was heading into a marriage with my long-term girl, and I had read the books 2-3 times each.  I was doing a lot of what you guys are doing here, darkroom practice, except the opposite I guess, back-dooring in through lucid dreaming and astral projection.  I respect greatly the difference in this sub, and agree.  My life changed in those days, but as my girlfriend moved in, and I followed my heart to be with her, I knew took Don Juan seriously when he said you only choose once: average man or sorcerer.  \n\nI chose average man.  I knew there was no way I wasn't having a marriage and kids.  And I knew the way of the Nagual would eat my alive with all those vulnerabilities and energy sucks.  I just would never have enough energy to do what I needed to do to get to the next level.  Kids, sex, love?  Are you kidding?  I could FEEL the lack of energy in astral projection, I could feel my reservoir running low and the dreamscapes crashing, my will and intent weakening.  I needed to store so much more energy if i wanted to progress.  And the #1 place I was spending energy was on my relationship with girlfriend. And I've been with her since we were young, and I wasn't going to leave her. \n\nSo.... I went down to the local library and handed my worn books over in a paper bag. It was my gesture to the universe, \"Thank you, thank you so much, for showing me this, now let someone else find these...\" \n\nI also felt, the books had become a crutch.  After the amount of time I spent with them, my feeling was, either I had internalized the knowledge, or I hadn't.  I couldn't help feeling it was time to let go, and not be tethered, not constantly run back to them, re-reading, memorizing, like an academic.  I wanted to see where I stood, what teaching I I had actually made part of me, and I wanted to see how far I could get on my own. \n\nAnd even weirder... I wanted to forget the teachings... and then remember them.  I wanted to experience what Carlos had... to wake up from dreaming and realize I had forgotten whole entire chunks of my teachings from years ago.  (That has happened to me, over and over, and it's beautiful)\n\nI still go back.  Mostly Wheel of Time and Power of Silence.  But I only 'borrow' them from the library, with a return date, so I don't break my vow.   \n\nI read another post the sub  by a guy who was sitting for 3 hours in the dark before he could even begin to find inner silence, because his wife and dog were constantly interrupting.  I couldn't help but laugh.  And sorta cry for him too. Because I remember that feeling; the wife and dog aren't to blame.  He has to choose.  It's right there. You can't have both. If you want a wife and dog, like I do, then you admit that Nagualism has changed you on the deepest, DNA level, gave you a buoy, a safe harbor, and has your heart forever - but you are an average man.  You chose that.  In my opinion, I took away the #1 teaching, the most important one: I chose a path with heart.

I could FEEL the lack of energy in astral projection, I could feel my reservoir running low and the dreamscapes crashing, my will and intent weakening.  I needed to store so much more energy if i wanted to progress.  And the #1 place I was spending energy was on my relationship with girlfriend. And I&amp;#39;ve been with her since we were young, and I wasn&amp;#39;t going to leave her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So.... I went down to the local library and handed my worn books over in a paper bag. It was my gesture to the universe, &amp;quot;Thank you, thank you so much, for showing me this, now let someone else find these...&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also felt, the books had become a crutch.  After the amount of time I spent with them, my feeling was, either I had internalized the knowledge, or I hadn&amp;#39;t.  I couldn&amp;#39;t help feeling it was time to let go, and not be tethered, not constantly run back to them, re-reading, memorizing, like an academic.  I wanted to see where I stood, what teaching I I had actually made part of me, and I wanted to see how far I could get on my own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And even weirder... I wanted to forget the teachings... and then remember them.  I wanted to experience what Carlos had... to wake up from dreaming and realize I had forgotten whole entire chunks of my teachings from years ago.  (That has happened to me, over and over, and it&amp;#39;s beautiful)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still go back.  Mostly Wheel of Time and Power of Silence.  But I only &amp;#39;borrow&amp;#39; them from the library, with a return date, so I don&amp;#39;t break my vow.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read another post the sub  by a guy who was sitting for 3 hours in the dark before he could even begin to find inner silence, because his wife and dog were constantly interrupting.  I couldn&amp;#39;t help but laugh.  And sorta cry for him too. Because I remember that feeling; the wife and dog aren&amp;#39;t to blame.  He has to choose.  It&amp;#39;s right there. You can&amp;#39;t have both. If you want a wife and dog, like I do, then you admit that Nagualism has changed you on the deepest, DNA level, gave you a buoy, a safe harbor, and has your heart forever - but you are an average man.  You chose that.  In my opinion, I took away the #1 teaching, the most important one: I chose a path with heart.  To leave my childhood sweetheart, to be a sorcerer, would not have been a path with heart, imo.  Ironic, in away.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false,

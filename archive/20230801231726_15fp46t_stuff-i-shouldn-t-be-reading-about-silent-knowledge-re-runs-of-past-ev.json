And I took that to include the witches books also.\n\nBut to produce materials to explain what Carlos taught us in classes, I accept having to search for specific things.  And reading just enough to find them.\n\nWhen possible I ask someone else to do it, but with a deadline to finish things, that's not always practical.\n\nCurrently I'm having to search the books to find quotes to explain the luminous sphere animation, and make it immune to attacks from the tedious \"Inventory Warriors\".\n\nAs you'll read about in this quote from the books!\n\nIt explains why even with supposedly good intentions and a desire to learn real magic,  angry men will attack anyway.\n\nEven with modern search tools, it's quite a task to locate what's needed for my animation.\n\nI found this while looking and couldn't resist passing it on.\n\nBut also another that was so amazing I was drooling.\n\nWhat we get to do!!!\n\nEventually.\n\nBut this one is pretty interesting.\n\nThat's what I do lately.\n\nWhen you do it yourself it's not quite as \"out of control\" as when a Nagual is pushing you into it the way don Juan did with Carlos.\n\nMeanwhile, what I'm missing right now is the quote that explains the assemblage point doesn't have to be pushed through the center by a nagual, but can move along the outside too.  By your own power.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDon Juan went back again to the topic under discussion: my journeys through the\u00a0dark sea of\u00a0awareness, and said that what I had done from my inner silence was very similar to what is done in dreaming when one is asleep. However, when journeying through the\u00a0dark sea of\u00a0awareness, there was no interruption of any sort caused by going to sleep, nor was there any attempt whatsoever at controlling one's attention while having a dream. The journey through the\u00a0dark sea of awareness\u00a0entailed an immediate response. There was an overpowering sensation of the here and now. \n\n**Don Juan lamented the fact that some idiotic sorcerers had given the name dreaming-awake to this act of reaching the dark sea\u00a0of awareness\u00a0directly, making the term\u00a0dreaming\u00a0even more ridiculous.**\n\n(oops...)\n\n\"When you thought that you had the dream-fantasy of going to that town of our choice,\" he continued, \"you had actually placed your\u00a0assemblage point\u00a0directly on a specific position on the\u00a0dark sea of awareness\u00a0that allows the journey. Then the\u00a0dark sea of aware\u00adness\u00a0supplied you with whatever was necessary to carry on that journey. There's no way whatsoever to choose that place at will. Sorcerers say that\u00a0inner silence\u00a0selects it unerringly. Simple, isn't it?\"\n\nHe explained to me then the intricacies of choice. He said that choice, for\u00a0warrior-travelers,\u00a0was not really the act of choosing, but rather the act of acquiescing elegantly to the solicitations of\u00a0infinity.\n\n\"Infinity\u00a0chooses,\" he said. \"The art of the\u00a0warrior-traveler is\u00a0to have the ability to move with the slightest insinuation, the art of acquiescing to every command of\u00a0infinity.\u00a0For this, a warrior-trav\u00adeler needs prowess, strength, and above everything else, sobriety. All those three put together give, as a result, elegance!\"\n\nAfter a moment's pause, I went back to the subject that intrigued me the most.\n\n\"But it's unbelievable that I actually went to that town, don Juan, in body and soul,\" I said.\n\n\"It is unbelievable, but it's not unlivable,\" he said. \"The uni\u00adverse has no limits, and the possibilities at play in the universe at large are indeed incommensurable. So don't fall prey to the axiom, 'I believe only what I see, because it is the dumbest stand one can possibly take.\"\n\nDon Juan's elucidation had been crystal clear. It made sense, but I didn't know where it made sense; certainly not in my daily world of usual affairs. Don Juan assured me then, unleashing a great trepidation in me, that there was only one way in which sorcerers could handle all this information: to taste it through experience, because the mind was incapable of taking in all that stimulation.\n\n\"What do you want me to do, don Juan?\" I asked.\n\n\"You must deliberately journey through the\u00a0dark sea of aware\u00adness\"\u00a0he replied, \"but you'll never know how this is done. Let's say that inner silence does it, following inexplicable ways, ways that cannot be understood, but only practiced.\"\n\nDon Juan had me sit down on my bed and adopt the position that fostered inner silence. I usually fell asleep instantly whenever I adopted this position. However, when I was with don Juan, his presence always made it impossible for me to fall asleep; instead, I entered into a veritable state of complete quietude. This time, after an instant of silence, I found myself walking. Don Juan was guiding me by holding my arm as we walked.\n\nWe were no longer in his house; we were walking in a Yaqui town I had never been in before. I knew of the town's existence; I had been close to it many times, but I had been made to turn around by the sheer hostility of the people who lived around it. It was a town where it was nearly impossible for a stranger to enter. The only non-Yaquis who had free access to that town were the supervisors from the federal bank because of the fact that the bank bought the crops from the Yaqui farmers. The endless nego\u00adtiations of the Yaqui farmers revolved around getting cash advances from the bank on the basis of a near-speculation process about future crops.\n\nI instantly recognized the town from the descriptions of people who had been there. As if to increase my astonishment, don Juan whispered in my ear that we were in the Yaqui town in question. I wanted to ask him how we had gotten there, but I couldn't articu\u00adlate my words. There were a large number of Indians talking in argumentative tones; tempers seemed to flare. I didn't understand a word of what they were saying, but the moment I conceived of the thought that I couldn't understand, something cleared up. It was very much as if more light went into the scene. Things became very defined and neat, and I understood what the people were say\u00ading although I didn't know how; I didn't speak their language. The words were definitely understandable to me, not singularly, but in clusters, as if my mind could pick up whole patterns of thought.\n\nI could say in earnest that I got the shock of a lifetime, not so much because I understood what they were saying but because of the content of what they were saying. Those people were indeed warlike. They were not Western men at all. Their propositions were propositions of strife, warfare, strategy. They were measuring their strength, their striking resources, and lamenting the fact that they had no power to deliver their blows. I registered in my body the anguish of their impotence. All they had were sticks and stones to fight high-technology weapons. They mourned the fact that they had no leaders. They coveted, more than anything else one could imagine, the rise of some charismatic fighter who could galvanize them.\n\nI heard then the voice of cynicism; one of them expressed a thought that seemed to devastate everyone equally, including me, for I seemed to be an indivisible part of them. He said that they were defeated beyond salvation, because if at a given moment one of them had the charisma to rise up and rally them, he would be betrayed because of envy and jealousy and hurt feelings.\n\nI wanted to comment to don Juan on what was happening to me, but I couldn't voice a single word. Only don Juan could talk.\n\n\"The Yaquis are not unique in their pettiness,\" he said in my ear. \"It is a condition in which human beings are trapped, a con\u00addition that is not even human, but imposed from the outside.\"\n\nI felt my mouth opening and closing involuntarily as I tried desperately to ask a question that I could not even conceive of. My mind was blank, void of thoughts. Don Juan and I were in the middle of a circle of people, but none of them seemed to have noticed us. I did not record any movement, reaction, or furtive glance that may have indicated that they were aware of us.\n\nThe next instant, I found myself in a Mexican town built around a railroad station, a town located about a mile and a half east of where don Juan lived. Don Juan and I were in the middle of the street by the government bank. Immediately afterward, I saw one of the strangest sights I had ever been witness to in don Juan's world. I was seeing energy as it flows in the universe, but I wasn't seeing human beings as spherical or oblong blobs of energy. The people around me were, in one instant, the normal beings of everyday life, and in the next instant, they were strange creatures. It was as if the ball of energy that we are were transparent; it was like a halo around an insect like core. That core did not have a primate's shape. There were no skeletal pieces, so I wasn't seeing people as if I had X-ray vision that went to the bone core. At the core of people there were, rather, geometric shapes made of what seemed to be hard vibrations of matter. That core was like letters of the alphabet\u2014a capital T seemed to be the main structural support. An inverted thick L was suspended in front of the T; the Greek letter for delta, which went almost to the floor, was at the bottom of the vertical bar of the T, and seemed to be a support for the whole structure. On top of the letter T, I saw a ropelike strand, perhaps an inch in diameter; it went through the top of the luminous sphere, as if what I was seeing were indeed a gigantic bead hanging from the top like a drooping gem.\n\nOnce, don Juan had presented to me a metaphor to describe the energetic union of strands of human beings. He had said that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico described those strands as a curtain made from beads strung on a string. I had taken this description literally, and thought that the string went through the conglomer\u00adate of energy fields that we are from head to toe. The attaching string I was seeing made the round shape of the energy fields of human beings look more like a pendant. I didn't see, however, any other creature being strung by the same string. Every single crea\u00adture that I\u00a0saw\u00a0was a geometrically patterned being that had a sort of string on the upper part of its spherical halo. The string reminded me immensely of the segmented worm like shapes that some of us see with the eyelids half closed when we are in sunlight.\n\nDon Juan and I walked in the town from one end to the other, and I\u00a0saw\u00a0literally scores of geometrically patterned creatures. My ability to see them was unstable in the extreme. I would see them for an instant, and then I would lose sight of them and I would be faced with average people.\n\nSoon, I became exhausted, and I could see only normal people. Don Juan said that it was time to go back home, and again, some\u00adthing in me lost my usual sense of continuity. I found myself in don Juan's house without having the slightest notion as to how I had covered the distance from the town to the house. I lay down in my bed and tried desperately to recollect, to call back my memory, to probe the depths of my very being for a clue as to how I had gone to the Yaqui town, and to the railroad-station town. I didn't believe that they had been dream-fantasies, because the scenes were too detailed to be anything but real, and yet they couldn't possibly have been real.\n\n\"You're wasting your time,\" don Juan said, laughing. \"I guaran\u00adtee you that you will never know how we got from the house to the Yaqui town, and from the Yaqui town to the railroad station, and from the railroad station to the house. There was a break in the continuity of time. That is what inner\u00a0silence\u00a0does.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Stuff I Shouldn't Be Reading About: Silent Knowledge Re-runs Of Past Events", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Practical Magic"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"2rcll8ipekfb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2rcll8ipekfb1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77a0ae9d42fd487a2a52050c42628c02b15cf426"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2rcll8ipekfb1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec40db6bb394754e7c831fb8e1625d17c593ffce"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2rcll8ipekfb1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b00d51834cd309d83f67c3273d7bea3e6b392cfc"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2rcll8ipekfb1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d2eb7857e79e7bb9719d22e51a49bf15e1aa9f7"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2rcll8ipekfb1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93f198749512c3b53e3dfc926fc66eb66c37258d"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2rcll8ipekfb1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cae1351e3bac26dce6a6cf3eccf302704a7e9ae"}], "s": {"y": 900, "x": 1600, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2rcll8ipekfb1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7593cf8e935d29c1a6de97ccd9a4e3f26b8a2a51"}, "id": "2rcll8ipekfb1"}}, "name": "t3_15fp46t", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Practical Magic", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5X5e63yH_m1cFLd-4rge-8pFNFe0CWa3Glp2XD0Aj9U.jpg", "edited": 1690926081.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1690924646.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2rcll8ipekfb1.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7593cf8e935d29c1a6de97ccd9a4e3f26b8a2a51\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/2rcll8ipekfb1.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7593cf8e935d29c1a6de97ccd9a4e3f26b8a2a51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In private classes Carlos got so tired of &amp;quot;Inventory Warriors&amp;quot;, clueless men who memorize facts from the books believing that&amp;#39;s sorcery knowledge, and will even correct Carlos himself, that he told us all to &amp;quot;stop reading the books of Carlos Castaneda&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I did.

On top of the letter T, I saw a ropelike strand, perhaps an inch in diameter; it went through the top of the luminous sphere, as if what I was seeing were indeed a gigantic bead hanging from the top like a drooping gem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once, don Juan had presented to me a metaphor to describe the energetic union of strands of human beings. He had said that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico described those strands as a curtain made from beads strung on a string. I had taken this description literally, and thought that the string went through the conglomer\u00adate of energy fields that we are from head to toe. The attaching string I was seeing made the round shape of the energy fields of human beings look more like a pendant. I didn&amp;#39;t see, however, any other creature being strung by the same string. Every single crea\u00adture that I\u00a0saw\u00a0was a geometrically patterned being that had a sort of string on the upper part of its spherical halo. The string reminded me immensely of the segmented worm like shapes that some of us see with the eyelids half closed when we are in sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan and I walked in the town from one end to the other, and I\u00a0saw\u00a0literally scores of geometrically patterned creatures. My ability to see them was unstable in the extreme. I would see them for an instant, and then I would lose sight of them and I would be faced with average people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soon, I became exhausted, and I could see only normal people. Don Juan said that it was time to go back home, and again, some\u00adthing in me lost my usual sense of continuity. I found myself in don Juan&amp;#39;s house without having the slightest notion as to how I had covered the distance from the town to the house. I lay down in my bed and tried desperately to recollect, to call back my memory, to probe the depths of my very being for a clue as to how I had gone to the Yaqui town, and to the railroad-station town. I didn&amp;#39;t believe that they had been dream-fantasies, because the scenes were too detailed to be anything but real, and yet they couldn&amp;#39;t possibly have been real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re wasting your time,&amp;quot; don Juan said, laughing. &amp;quot;I guaran\u00adtee you that you will never know how we got from the house to the Yaqui town, and from the Yaqui town to the railroad station, and from the railroad station to the house. There was a break in the continuity of time. That is what inner\u00a0silence\u00a0does.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null,

It explains what cyclic beings are.\n\nBut it's still not the one I was looking for.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDon Juan explained that the art of dreaming originated in a very casual observation that the sorcerers of ancient Mexico made when they saw people that were asleep. They noticed that during sleep the assemblage point is displaced in a very natural, easy way from its habitual position, and it moves anywhere along the periphery of the luminous sphere, or to any place in the interior of it. Correlating their seeing with the reports of the people that had been asleep, they realized that the greater the observed displacement of the assemblage point, the more astounding the reports of things and scenes experienced in dreams.\n\nThose sorcerers avidly looked for opportunities to displace their own assemblage points, and they ended up using psychotropic plants to accomplish this. Soon, they realized that the displacement brought about by using these plants was erratic, forced, and out of control. Don Juan said that in the midst of this failure, they discovered one thing of great value. The sorcerers of ancient times called it dreaming attention, or the capacity that practitioners acquire to maintain their awareness unwaveringly on the items of their dreams.\n\nThe end result of those sorcerers' new endeavors was the art of dreaming as it stands today. Through discipline, they succeeded in developing their dreaming attention to an extraordinary degree. They were able to focus it on any element of their dreams, and found out, in this fashion, that there were two kinds of dreams. One was the dreams that we are all familiar with, in which phantasmagorical elements come into play, something which we could categorize as the product of our mentality, our psyche; perhaps something that has to do with our neurological makeup. The other kind of dreams, they called energy-generating dreams. Don Juan said that those sorcerers of ancient times found themselves in dreams that were not dreams, but actual visitations made in a dream-like state to bona fide places other than this world - real places, just like the world in which we live: places where the objects of the dream generated energy, just like trees, or animals, or even rocks generate energy in our daily world.\n\nTheir visions of such places, were, however, too fleeting, too temporary, to be of any value to them. They attributed this flaw to the fact that their assemblage points could not be held, for any considerable time, fixed at the position to which they had been displaced. Their attempts to remedy the situation resulted in the other high art of sorcery: the art of stalking, or the feat of holding the assemblage point fixed at the position to which it had been displaced. This fixation allowed them the opportunity to witness that world in its full extent. **Don Juan said that some of those sorcerers never returned from their journeys. In other words, they opted for staying there, wherever \"there\" was.**\n\nDon Juan said that in mapping human beings as luminous spheres, those sorcerers at ancient times discovered **six hundred spots in the total luminous sphere** which give, as a result, if the assemblage point happened to be fixed at any of them, the entrance into a total new world. His answer to my unavoidable question, \"But where are those worlds\" was \"in the position of the assemblage point.\" Nothing could be truer than that statement, and yet, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever to us.\n\n(Cyclic beings is what that above highlighted passage refers to)\n\nHowever, if it is examined in the light of the sorcerers' capacity to see energy as it flows in the universe, it makes sense for them. Their position is that the assemblage point at its habitual location receives an inflow of energy fields from the universe at large in the form of luminous energy filaments. Consistently, the same filaments, numbering in the billions, go through the assemblage point, giving as a result the world that we know. If the assemblage point is displaced to another position, another set of energy filaments goes through. Sorcerers feel that this new set of energy filaments cannot possibly give a view of the same world; that by definition that world has to be different from the world of everyday life. Since the assemblage point is not only the center where perception is assembled, but the center where interpretation of sensory data is accomplished, sorcerers feel that it will interpret the new influx of energy fields in very much the same terms in which it interprets the world of everyday life. The result of this new interpretation is the view of a world which is strangely similar to ours, and yet intrinsically different. Don Juan said that it is only the interpretation of the assemblage point which accounts for the sense of similarity, and that energetically, other worlds are as different from ours as they could possibly be.\n\nIn order to express this wondrous quality of the assemblage point and the possibilities of perception brought about by dreaming, a new syntax is needed; or perhaps the same syntax of our language could cover it if this experience made available to any one of us, and not merely to shaman initiates.\n\nAnother thing which was of tremendous interest to me, but which bewildered me to no end, was don Juan's statement that there was really no procedure to speak of that would teach anyone how to dream; that more than anything else, dreaming was a penurious effort on the part of the practitioners to put themselves in contact with the indescribable perennial force that sorcerers call intent. Once this link was established, dreaming also mysteriously became established. Don Juan asserted that this linkage could be accomplished following any pattern that implied discipline.\n\nHowever, what was of supreme importance for don Juan in order to accomplish the feat of dreaming was to follow the warrior's path, or the philosophical construct which sorcerers use to buttress their actions, wherever they happen to be, in this world, or in any other world besides this one. Following the warriors' path brought about a homogeneity of results in the absence of any precise patterning. The devices that sorcerers of ancient times used to aid the displacement of the assemblage point were the magical passes, which purported to give them the stability necessary to call forth dreaming attention, without which there is no possibility of dreaming in the fashion of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico without the aid of dreaming attention, practitioners could aspire at best, to have lucid dreams about phantasmagorical worlds, or even perhaps views of worlds that generate energy, but which made no sense whatsoever in the absence of an all-inclusive rationale that would properly categorize them.", "edited": 1690929806.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_juen9rr", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s another that pertains to moving the assemblage point without the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow.

Correlating their seeing with the reports of the people that had been asleep, they realized that the greater the observed displacement of the assemblage point, the more astounding the reports of things and scenes experienced in dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those sorcerers avidly looked for opportunities to displace their own assemblage points, and they ended up using psychotropic plants to accomplish this. Soon, they realized that the displacement brought about by using these plants was erratic, forced, and out of control. Don Juan said that in the midst of this failure, they discovered one thing of great value. The sorcerers of ancient times called it dreaming attention, or the capacity that practitioners acquire to maintain their awareness unwaveringly on the items of their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The end result of those sorcerers&amp;#39; new endeavors was the art of dreaming as it stands today. Through discipline, they succeeded in developing their dreaming attention to an extraordinary degree. They were able to focus it on any element of their dreams, and found out, in this fashion, that there were two kinds of dreams. One was the dreams that we are all familiar with, in which phantasmagorical elements come into play, something which we could categorize as the product of our mentality, our psyche; perhaps something that has to do with our neurological makeup. The other kind of dreams, they called energy-generating dreams. Don Juan said that those sorcerers of ancient times found themselves in dreams that were not dreams, but actual visitations made in a dream-like state to bona fide places other than this world - real places, just like the world in which we live: places where the objects of the dream generated energy, just like trees, or animals, or even rocks generate energy in our daily world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their visions of such places, were, however, too fleeting, too temporary, to be of any value to them. They attributed this flaw to the fact that their assemblage points could not be held, for any considerable time, fixed at the position to which they had been displaced. Their attempts to remedy the situation resulted in the other high art of sorcery: the art of stalking, or the feat of holding the assemblage point fixed at the position to which it had been displaced. This fixation allowed them the opportunity to witness that world in its full extent. &lt;strong&gt;Don Juan said that some of those sorcerers never returned from their journeys. In other words, they opted for staying there, wherever &amp;quot;there&amp;quot; was.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan said that in mapping human beings as luminous spheres, those sorcerers at ancient times discovered &lt;strong&gt;six hundred spots in the total luminous sphere&lt;/strong&gt; which give, as a result, if the assemblage point happened to be fixed at any of them, the entrance into a total new world. His answer to my unavoidable question, &amp;quot;But where are those worlds&amp;quot; was &amp;quot;in the position of the assemblage point.&amp;quot; Nothing could be truer than that statement, and yet, it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense whatsoever to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Cyclic beings is what that above highlighted passage refers to)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if it is examined in the light of the sorcerers&amp;#39; capacity to see energy as it flows in the universe, it makes sense for them. Their position is that the assemblage point at its habitual location receives an inflow of energy fields from the universe at large in the form of luminous energy filaments. Consistently, the same filaments, numbering in the billions, go through the assemblage point, giving as a result the world that we know. If the assemblage point is displaced to another position, another set of energy filaments goes through. Sorcerers feel that this new set of energy filaments cannot possibly give a view of the same world; that by definition that world has to be different from the world of everyday life. Since the assemblage point is not only the center where perception is assembled, but the center where interpretation of sensory data is accomplished, sorcerers feel that it will interpret the new influx of energy fields in very much the same terms in which it interprets the world of everyday life. The result of this new interpretation is the view of a world which is strangely similar to ours, and yet intrinsically different. Don Juan said that it is only the interpretation of the assemblage point which accounts for the sense of similarity, and that energetically, other worlds are as different from ours as they could possibly be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In order to express this wondrous quality of the assemblage point and the possibilities of perception brought about by dreaming, a new syntax is needed; or perhaps the same syntax of our language could cover it if this experience made available to any one of us, and not merely to shaman initiates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing which was of tremendous interest to me, but which bewildered me to no end, was don Juan&amp;#39;s statement that there was really no procedure to speak of that would teach anyone how to dream; that more than anything else, dreaming was a penurious effort on the part of the practitioners to put themselves in contact with the indescribable perennial force that sorcerers call intent. Once this link was established, dreaming also mysteriously became established. Don Juan asserted that this linkage could be accomplished following any pattern that implied discipline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, what was of supreme importance for don Juan in order to accomplish the feat of dreaming was to follow the warrior&amp;#39;s path, or the philosophical construct which sorcerers use to buttress their actions, wherever they happen to be, in this world, or in any other world besides this one. Following the warriors&amp;#39; path brought about a homogeneity of results in the absence of any precise patterning. The devices that sorcerers of ancient times used to aid the displacement of the assemblage point were the magical passes, which purported to give them the stability necessary to call forth dreaming attention, without which there is no possibility of dreaming in the fashion of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico without the aid of dreaming attention, practitioners could aspire at best, to have lucid dreams about phantasmagorical worlds, or even perhaps views of worlds that generate energy, but which made no sense whatsoever in the absence of an all-inclusive rationale that would properly categorize them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/15fp46t/stuff_i_shouldnt_be_reading_about_silent/juen9rr/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1690929383.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_15fp46t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "juluik1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jujzozv", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I posted it on facebook and on instagram.\n\nHere's the Facebook text:\n\n Hot On The Trail  \n\n\nWe're hot on the trail of another way to connect to the intent of the seers of ancient Mexico, left to us by Carlos.  \n\n\nIn some ways, Amy's book triggered it.  \n\n\nWhile others read it and gave up (all private class members but 3), and others read it and cursed Amy (who Lidotska says was simply in love with Carlos, and set up to write that book by him), we instead got someone to read it and analyze it, and extract important details.  \n\n\nAmy wasn't afraid to expose the hidden side of sorcery: Sex magic.  \n\n\nIt stands to reason that sorcerers use anything and everything available to them, because the task of teaching apprentices is nearly impossible.  \n\n\nLook at what happened in our community!

Through Silent Knowledge.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t explain it here, there isn&amp;#39;t enough text allowance on Instagram.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the link is, Silence -&amp;gt; Silent Knowledge &amp;quot;re-runs&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; connection to a topic of concern -&amp;gt; navigation to the next related part of that topic which has a higher energy content -&amp;gt; direct link to the energy of the old seers.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also connected to &amp;quot;sex magic&amp;quot;, but please don&amp;#39;t anyone start writing your &amp;quot;Toltec Tantra&amp;quot; book.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sex magic only works when one party has a direct link of unbroken awareness passed to someone here and now, through all the generation of seers going back to the Olmecs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s just some crazy man &amp;quot;gathering his 4 winds&amp;quot;, it only amounts to abuse.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m lucky to have taken the advice of Carlos 25 years ago, when he told us to be celibate.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I did get an invite to have sex with Florinda, just as Tony Lama got an invite to have sex with Carol Tiggs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s part of the entire body of sorcery knowledge.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for what these bubbles are, they&amp;#39;re a bit like a warning that when you navigate into the dark sea of awareness, the journey has no end. And it begins to reach past &amp;quot;Human&amp;quot; realms, into marginally human, and finally non-human.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a side effect of getting on that very profitable road.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t just lead where you want to go.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It goes on forever.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot; out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_15fp46t", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/15fp46t/stuff_i_shouldnt_be_reading_about_silent/julzsa1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1691065776.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1691065776.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jujzozv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1691023250.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jueij3p", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/repy3vf7ksfb1.jpeg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77d3ebc76c40a6e31bb7000713dae96e1f06c00d\n\nHard to know exactly what he saw.

In a multitude of luminous balls, I reasoned, the energy filaments that are outside one of them will perforce be inside the adjacent one. So in a multitude there could not possibly be any energy filaments outside any luminous ball.\n\n\"To understand all this certainly isn't an exercise for your reason,\" he replied after carefully listening to my arguments. \"I have no way of explaining what sorcerers mean by filaments inside and outside the human shape. When seers see the human energy shape, they see one single ball of energy. If there is another ball next to it, the other ball is seen again as a single ball of energy.

And bringing him candy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m introverted and i also have difficulties in social situations. usually i don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable with people i don&amp;#39;t know. but that&amp;#39;s not always the case. on some days, maybe because i&amp;#39;m in a different mood it&amp;#39;s different. and substantial alcohol consumption in bars was also able to change my introverted disposition. so it seems to be dependant on the position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;recently my mother died, and i was visiting her in the hospital in her last weeks. she got suddenly very ill and i didn&amp;#39;t anticipate that she would die. everytime that feelings of grief would overwhelm me, i didn&amp;#39;t allow myself to indulge in that feelings by trying to not-thinking at all and it worked to some extent. not that it would make me suddenly happy, there is a background sadness, but i avoided the intense feelings of misery. this technique also helped me to get through the funeral. i don&amp;#39;t know if this is just psychological repression and that in the long run it&amp;#39;s not good for me or if it&amp;#39;s actually a technique that stalkers would also use in such a situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;another situation years ago was when i had to speak in front a large audience in a university lecture. i&amp;#39;m shy and i hate to speak in front of people. but that one time i got angry and fed up with myself just moments before my talk, because again i would feel like shit because i had to speak in front of people - at least i thought so. when i went in front of the audience the usual feeling of being miserable was gone - i didn&amp;#39;t care that i had to talk to the audience. somehow that angriness helped me to change the mood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*******&lt;br/&gt;\nand what i wanted to add. when searching in the pdf i came across this explanation about the luminous balls and the emanations which i also was asking myself because i got a wrong understanding and thought of it like a volume filled with 3-dimensional spheres next to each other:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;page 1174, &amp;quot;the art of dreaming&amp;quot;, chapter 1, page 13:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But if I thought of a multitude of luminous balls, the model broke down in my mind. In a multitude of luminous balls, I reasoned, the energy filaments that are outside one of them will perforce be inside the adjacent one. So in a multitude there could not possibly be any energy filaments outside any luminous ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To understand all this certainly isn&amp;#39;t an exercise for your reason,&amp;quot; he replied after carefully listening to my arguments. &amp;quot;I have no way of explaining what sorcerers mean by filaments inside and outside the human shape. When seers see the human energy shape, they see one single ball of energy. If there is another ball next to it, the other ball is seen again as a single ball of energy.

The universe is an infinite agglomeration of energy fields, resembling threads of light.\n2. These energy fields, called the Eagle's emanations, radiate from a source of inconceivable proportions metaphorically called the Eagle.\n3. Human beings are also composed of an incalculable number of the same threadlike energy fields. These Eagle's emanations form an encased agglomeration that manifests itself as a ball of light the size of the person's body with the arms extended laterally, like a giant luminous egg.\n4. Only a very small group of the energy fields inside this luminous ball are lit up by a point of intense brilliance located on the ball's surface.\n5. Perception occurs when the energy fields in that small group immediately surrounding the point of brilliance extend their light to illuminate identical energy fields outside the ball. Since the only energy fields perceivable are those lit by the point of brilliance, that point is named \"the point where perception is assembled\" or simply \"the assemblage point.\"\n6. **The assemblage point can be moved from its usual position on the surface of the luminous ball to another position on the surface, or into the interior.** Since the brilliance of the assemblage point can light up whatever energy field it comes in contact with, when it moves to a new position it immediately brightens up new energy fields, making them perceivable. This perception is known as *seeing*.\n7. When the assemblage point shifts, it makes possible the perception of an entirely different world - as objective and factual as the one we normally perceive. Sorcerers go into that other world to get energy, power, solutions to general and particular problems, or to face the unimaginable.\n8. Intent is the pervasive force that causes us to perceive. We do not become aware because we perceive; rather, we perceive as a result of the pressure and intrusion of intent.\n9. The aim of sorcerers is to reach a state of total awareness in order to experience all the possibilities of perception available to man. This state of awareness even implies an alternative way of dying.\n\nA level of practical knowledge was included as part of teaching the mastery of awareness. On that practical level don Juan taught the procedures necessary to move the assemblage point. The two great systems devised by the sorcerer seers of ancient times to accomplish this were: *dreaming*, the control and utilization of dreams; and stalking, the control of behavior.\n\n**Moving one's assemblage point was an essential maneuver that every sorcerer had to learn. Some of them, the naguals, also learned to perform it for others.** They were able to dislodge the assemblage point from its customary position by delivering a hard slap directly to the assemblage point.

She was manipulating it like the old seers did, at that rock they buried themselves under, so they could scare passers by to death and steal their energy.\n\nKeep in mind, I ONLY do sorcery fully awake, completely sober, and with my eyes wide open. \n\nOtherwise gullible people would claim some Yogi or Buddhist did that too.\n\nBoth Cholita and the \"demon\" looked disappointed that I wasn't afraid of it. \n\nThe demon frowned, and then turned into an \"impossible\" sculpture. More like a machine it was. The demon knew how to please me and extract more energy through curiosity, if he couldn't scare me and get energy that way.\n\nIt was like a mobius strip in that if you followed the shape of it around, it ended up back where it started.  But it was clearly impossible for that to happen.\n\nI walked over to it (by this time Cholita wasn't pinning me down anymore), and looked under it for an on/off switch.  For the brightness.\n\nWhat I didn't know was,  the three of us like that had split the house in two. It was an \"energetic event\" that created a new reality.\n\nIt made a second copy of the house.\n\nLater I walked in there by accident, fully awake and by simply opening the hallway door to the living room, and found that little demon in there pretending to be a lizard.\n\nIt was surely the second ally of Carlos, the Devil's weed ally!  Carlos had introduced us to both of his allies, in private class. And they responded by making the water cooler burp, on demand.\n\nJust like the gurgling teapot in the first books.\n\nThat second copy of our home is still around to this day, and keeps expanding as Cholita plays in it.\n\nBut she rarely lets me go in there.  Witches can \"block\" things.\n\nSounds like nonsense?\n\nActually that's where the 17 books and publications come in.\n\nWhen I made a post for it, the subreddit discovered that in Taisha's latest book, the entire book takes place in a phantom copy of don Juan's home we've been trying to track down.\n\nAnd we all recalled that Carlos had said there was a phantom copy of his home at Pandora.  Miles walked into it by accident once, and Carlos invited me over alone towards the end, and stood me by the entrance hoping I'd take a few steps back and end up there.  While he went ott the kitchen to prepare me a \"chinese parting gift\".\n\nHalf a pear.  In chinese symbology, it means a master is breaking up with a student under unfortunate circumstances.\n\nSo when you're doing REAL sorcery, not the pretending kind that's in the first 3 books, which can't possibly be duplicated by anyone in our modern times since the rituals and the allies are missing, you'll need to have all of the books for solving mysteries such as how a witch and a demon can split your home into 2 pieces.\n\nAs it turns out, all sorcerers homes eventually split in half like that.\n\nYou'd never guess that from what the \"Men of Knowledge\" knew.\n\nWhich was more than any Buddhist ever knew, but not what is needed to become like the new seers.\n\nThat second Ally of Carlos also took the form of a little boy.  And Cholita's grown male lover in a tuxedo.\n\nI sent the first Ally of Carlos to protect Cholita, you can see her standing there in that picture.\n\nThere's a tensegrity pass in here which she selected as a summoning spell.\n\nInsisted if someone did that just a few times, she could detect the energy of it from anywhere, and might go help them if they had learned to reach the green zone on the J curve.\n\nWhich she did! \n\nBut I lost her in the process.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tne1br3ow2gb1.jpeg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f210998deec88c53b52c468d4432a472e25eb9a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut those are a good start.\n\nIt's hard to believe no one ever actually researched the books well, and made a timeline.\n\nIt would be nice to know when, and were, for every story in there.\n\nEspecially since that matters a lot in sorcery.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_juqx0w0", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are good finds!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m glad they ended up in here, in case we need to go back and find them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d sure like to track down a story where Carlos was at a 3rd location.

In chinese symbology, it means a master is breaking up with a student under unfortunate circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when you&amp;#39;re doing REAL sorcery, not the pretending kind that&amp;#39;s in the first 3 books, which can&amp;#39;t possibly be duplicated by anyone in our modern times since the rituals and the allies are missing, you&amp;#39;ll need to have all of the books for solving mysteries such as how a witch and a demon can split your home into 2 pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, all sorcerers homes eventually split in half like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d never guess that from what the &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot; knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was more than any Buddhist ever knew, but not what is needed to become like the new seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That second Ally of Carlos also took the form of a little boy.  And Cholita&amp;#39;s grown male lover in a tuxedo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sent the first Ally of Carlos to protect Cholita, you can see her standing there in that picture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a tensegrity pass in here which she selected as a summoning spell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Insisted if someone did that just a few times, she could detect the energy of it from anywhere, and might go help them if they had learned to reach the green zone on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which she did! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I lost her in the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tne1br3ow2gb1.jpeg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7f210998deec88c53b52c468d4432a472e25eb9a\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/tne1br3ow2gb1.jpeg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7f210998deec88c53b52c468d4432a472e25eb9a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But those are a good start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to believe no one ever actually researched the books well, and made a timeline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to know when, and were, for every story in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially since that matters a lot in sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_15fp46t", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/15fp46t/stuff_i_shouldnt_be_reading_about_silent/juqx0w0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1691148575.0, "media_metadata": {"tne1br3ow2gb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpeg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tne1br3ow2gb1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13cc921a27d3b2ee9ab3b71321e2bfbeaa6908e1"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tne1br3ow2gb1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35a2c0c60bda6a1f1d9c9ced36f8ef2f1fce1394"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tne1br3ow2gb1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b71315c6536dd336f2c0170ba08db539cf0e1ebf"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tne1br3ow2gb1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0a1d82990b85d33761cad3d02d7b2a1cb8edf7d"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tne1br3ow2gb1.jpeg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2e443302fc3298e637b81c75c0233aabca94860"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tne1br3ow2gb1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4717d231daac2945e9f0a86d1e04c8eb68effde"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/tne1br3ow2gb1.jpeg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f210998deec88c53b52c468d4432a472e25eb9a"}, "id": "tne1br3ow2gb1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1691148575.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "juopptq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ixtlaner", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_junpc20", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_qb0snx5c", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "In \"A seperate Reality\" Carlos is always visiting don Juan in Sonora(years 68,69) except in chapter 1 and chapter 6.\n\nchapter 1  \nDon Juan told me, matter-of-factly, that I was there just in time to take him back to Sonora\n\nchapter 4  \nOn September 4, 1968, I went to Sonora to visit don Juan\t\n\nchapter6  \nJust as we were getting into my car to start on a trip to central Mexico, on October 5, 1968(first trip to Genaro, waterfall show, then they go back)  \nOctober 23,1968  \nDon Juan casually mentioned that he was going to make another trip to central Mexico in the near future.(thay talk about waterfall show)\n\nchapter 7  \n Don Juan was not at his house when I arrived there at midday on November 8, 1968.

Here&amp;#39;s a picture of what it looked like (no exaggeration at all) when she taught me to leave this galaxy in my physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you&amp;#39;ll realize that you found real magic, and a place to learn it for free, with the help of 3 private class students, and dozens more who have been around for years and can make it work too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And stay out of the gutter subreddits?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xt6d7hj013gb1.jpeg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6ccbef586e050e4027c451e6942b1a91d32d7472\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/xt6d7hj013gb1.jpeg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6ccbef586e050e4027c451e6942b1a91d32d7472&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_15fp46t", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/15fp46t/stuff_i_shouldnt_be_reading_about_silent/juqyw5s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1691149644.0, "media_metadata": {"xt6d7hj013gb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpeg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xt6d7hj013gb1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c365850ebf7dfad40d8384a85877b5e345004822"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xt6d7hj013gb1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=508eb4dc863cbf73bdbe35b2f8ace755377a6771"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xt6d7hj013gb1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b9a94d22557b7b61cf8315cd17862fbdd813cc7"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xt6d7hj013gb1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0408f0030e8b057a12ab64e71608d39b79b191b2"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xt6d7hj013gb1.jpeg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c6a3081f116414fecf18d788b61544040d5ea1d"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xt6d7hj013gb1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cfe95da21680d745f9191a7c47f71068f59b238"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xt6d7hj013gb1.jpeg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ccbef586e050e4027c451e6942b1a91d32d7472"}, "id": "xt6d7hj013gb1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1691149644.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "juov7u9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ixtlaner", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_junsoy5", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_qb0snx5c", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I wasn't aware that my user ID may be harmfull to others.

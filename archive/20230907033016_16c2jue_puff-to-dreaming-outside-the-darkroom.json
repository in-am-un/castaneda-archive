I felt lazy and wanted to simply hang out there to stare into the puff. All this going on and the only verbal thoughts I had were:\n\n\"Pee? Nahh no need\u2026..\"\n\nI then laid there on my arm observing the puff until the scene appeared and thought \"Cooooollllll\" when details progressively became perceivable.  \n\nThat was pretty much all the word-based internal dialogue I had at that time. \n\nOne advantage of being in a half asleep state is that the prefrontal cortex, center of \"complex cognitive function\" aka mental masturbation epicenter was nearly shut off completely.

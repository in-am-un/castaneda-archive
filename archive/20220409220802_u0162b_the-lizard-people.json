Do you believe lizards can talk?](https://preview.redd.it/xlbb792p3ks81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6be77037bb14942646aa72929261c5afeed0d650)\n\nCholita has warned me a few times about \"The Lizard People\".\n\nAt one point I seem to recall, it was possible that \"the lizard people\", controlling the Freemasons with their superior alien intelligence,  had arranged to kidnap Cholita using Chinese spies because sad old white men like me needed wives.\n\nI'm not sure she's convinced of that anymore, but since then I've learned to respect the horrors of the Lizard people.\n\nBut not the ones Cholita was worrying about.\n\nThe truly horrific ones, are the Castaneda fans who try to recreate the Lizard ritual from the books by catching actual lizards, sunbathing on huge rocks.\n\nNaturally if they plan to do that, they've already been consuming Devil's Weed tea.\n\nOtherwise I can't imagine how that would sound fun.\n\nAnd fun is really all they're after.   Fun and attention.\n\nSorcery?  Nope.\n\nThese \"Lizard People\" are perhaps the worst among the Castaneda fan club.\n\nUnless you consider the truth of the matter.  The evil men who write nonsense against Carlos, are also part of that \"fan club\".\n\nThey just want to be \"the fan who took the celebrity down\".\n\nLike De Mille.   He \"cashed in\",  just like all the other bad guys who attacked Carlos.\n\nI'm including Gordon Wasson in there.  The so called, \"expert on mushrooms\", who \"exposed\" the fraud of Carlos.\n\n\"You can't smoke mushrooms!\" he said, with his scholarly authority.\n\nWhat???   Why not?\n\nIt seems to me, Wasson was so pedestrian he was thinking of how expensive mushrooms were at the local drug dealer, and it never occurred to him that Olmecs lived in \"All you can eat for free,  magic mushroom territory.\"\n\nBack 7000 years ago that is.  Or if you still believe it was the Toltecs, back 1000 years ago.\n\nBut a little honest imagination might have told Wasson, perhaps those ancient sorcerers liked the mushrooms to burn a little, in order to share the mushroom as smoke, for the spirits.\n\nAnd I can guarantee one thing. If you had Wasson tied to a chair with a card table in front of him,  one arm free so he could use it, and put the smoking mixture into a big pipe on the table, there's no way he'd take a big puff on it following the instructions don Juan gave in that book.\n\nEven if you told him, \"We'll let you go free, after you show us that you can't smoke mushrooms and get high.\"\n\nThe jealous phony would refuse to do it, because he'd know full well you'd get totally plastered doing that!  And fast too.  The powdered mushroom dust would coat your tongue, throat, and even the inside of your lungs.\n\nThe rest of the smoking mixture would make it seem \"comfortable\", despite choking on the powder.\n\nYou could try this at home!  Get some high quality weed, mixed with 20 of the world's strongest magic mushrooms ground to a fine powder, and stick it in a pipe.\n\nWon't get high?  Are you kidding???\n\nJust stuffing the mixture into the pipe would probably microdose you.\n\nBut Wasson only wanted to hurt Carlos, so he lied.\n\nAnd said you can't smoke mushrooms.\n\nBasically, that's how all the \"anti-Carlos\" info out there came to be.  Bad men, jealous of Carlos, trashing him with poorly thought up nonsense.\n\nThere's an excellent analysis of this in the wiki.  All the \"criticisms\" exposed for what they are.\n\nCrap from the river of shit.\n\nBut that should be obvious if you look at the pictures now available of what you can learn to do, which perfectly matches the details in the books.\n\nExcept that as we progress in knowledge, once in a while you realize maybe you misunderstood what the book was telling you.\n\nDidn't \"read between the lines\".\n\nIf you're a \"lizard person\", and want to go mutilate lizards innocently sunbathing on rocks, then go ahead.\n\nJust leave the community alone. Become a \"streaker\" if you need attention that badly.\n\nBut I sure don't understand why you think any of those \"Man of Knowledge\" rituals will work, without your own \"Ally\".\n\nIf you believe that, you need to cut back on the Devil's Weed tea!\n\nAnd I agree with De Mille on the likely extreme difficulty of sewing the eyelids of a lizard shut.\n\nEven with \"big rude stitches\".\n\nAlthough if anyone could do it, don Juan was the guy.\n\nIt's just that, he didn't have to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Lizard People!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Inorganic Beings"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"xlbb792p3ks81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xlbb792p3ks81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9743093c5da3e7d51a3a9d38fbddbe1bd65ce015"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xlbb792p3ks81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bb939807b8023135c85d9c7028c62e36382fdb4"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xlbb792p3ks81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db531ab0c4b6f63ee6426722e4cf9e719ce8d99b"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xlbb792p3ks81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b03ee88630b8767d488f29612734a5224ba696f"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xlbb792p3ks81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae68066d4b55b82e7e93ec58e7ec80df6aba02a2"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xlbb792p3ks81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2de884713a529c5bae2713ae10ed16d459352a97"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/xlbb792p3ks81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6be77037bb14942646aa72929261c5afeed0d650"}, "id": "xlbb792p3ks81"}}, "name": "t3_u0162b", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 13, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Inorganic Beings", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 13, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/a0p1acA38C2Td6-6U-Ioj3ulpxa5kHXl-mgl6AgKvGg.jpg", "edited": 1649539246.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1649534882.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xlbb792p3ks81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6be77037bb14942646aa72929261c5afeed0d650\"&gt;Did Carlos actually have Lizards on his shoulders?

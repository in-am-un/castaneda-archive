But it was a physical blob, solid and massive, yet flat and ethereal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I focused on the feeling, it was somehow tied to both the corn, and a past incident I hadn&amp;#39;t been able to identify.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one thing was clear, I&amp;#39;d just untangled an energy strand that got stuck long ago. It unraveled as a result of going through my daily life, and running into the right combination of items, in silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When your shields are gone, meaning that horrible internal dialogue which blinds you to everything, and forces you to focus on the items of the tonal, you begin to notice &amp;quot;energetic facts&amp;quot; about the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one is that ALL interactions in the world have the essence of that dramatic realization behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re bombarded by movements of our assemblage point which make us experience something as a result of perceiving a thing right in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s as if every object in the world is magical, and has a vision associated with it.  We put those together to make our daily world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just block the fact out, hiding the associations behind our image of the Tonal and how we are supposed to &lt;strong&gt;be&lt;/strong&gt; within it, and it becomes an entanglement where energy is lost because we never finished the realization.  It&amp;#39;s like unfinished business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t explain it better than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no one should go looking for that.  Wait till it happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, it&amp;#39;s like the &amp;quot;impeccable warrior&amp;quot; pretense.  It&amp;#39;s a placebo for the mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no pretending in sorcery.

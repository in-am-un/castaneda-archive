The closer I can get to the real thing, the less anyone can criticize the cartoon Carlos.\n\nI did make him a bit tall, but that's because Carlos was always pointing out how tall the visiting Argentinians were.\n\nAnd their amazing boots.\n\nSo I made the cartoon Carlos taller than anyone else will ever be in the animations, and gave him some tasteful boots of his own.\n\nI was even joking with some of the witches on reddit that any character from \"Tell them Willie Boy Is Here\", filmed out at Morongo and starring Robert Redford, are fair usage for the cartoons. \n\nWhile I was visiting that movie set at age 12, someone pointed out Carlos in the huge collection of people standing around on bare dirt at the reservation.  \n\nAnd Carlos started his search for don Juan, at Morongo.\n\nSo if I need one of the characters from the books, to make flashback cartoons, and it's blasphemy to create what I think they look like, I can just use characters from that movie which seem appropriate.\n\nSuch as the rogue Indian \"Willie\" and his girlfriend Lola.  I can use them for Genaro and La Gorda, who will often be needed for \"flashback\" scenes.\n\nThe new version of the \"Headshot\" software is supposed to use AI, but you never really know why they're claiming that.\n\nI still remember \"fuzzy logic\" from the 80s. \n\nThe Japanese revolution in computers!  That and their announced 100MHz processor supercomputers.\n\n\"Back to the Future\" fell for it, with a future dominated by the Japanese.\n\nBut AI is real these days, and the software does make much better clones.\n\nI could put the chacmools in dance home in 60 minutes from all the videos and magazine interview pictures out there.\n\nJust for fun, I \"recreated\" the infamous Greg Film of Carlos talking to Jadey.\n\nHopefully the next time I do that, you'll be viewing it as a passenger in the back seat of Greg (Shaman Bob's) car, watching him spy on Carlos with his scientology giant Camcorder.\n\nNow I see why movie makers like to do recreations in scenes!\n\nMaybe,  have Carlos walk by like the famous bigfoot movie, where he glances to the side and then walks away fast?\n\nOr copy the general arrangement of a scene from Star Wars using Carlos in place of Yoda, talking to young Anakin.\n\nI supposed I should rescan Greg with the new software to make the 3D version look as much like him as possible?\n\nThe first attempt left room for doubt.\n\nFor Beginners, Greg and his wife spied on Carlos just to \"defeat\" him.\n\nThe same nonsense we see in here. The same thing that prevented Carlos from originally teaching for free in public parks back in the 80s.\n\nHecklers.  Some even dangerous enough to require keeping a gun around.\n\nI just wish I knew where Kylie hid it in those tight outfits.\n\nReal magic just simply comes under attack.\n\nIt doesn't even seem to make much sense.\n\nBut it's universal.  And Carlos blamed it on \"the fliers\".\n\nGreg and Gabby so badly wanted video footage of Carlos, that they climbed up to look out the window in the next building just right of Dance Home.  During a private class.\n\nThey went through his trash at Pandora,  looking for papers or anything scandalous.\n\nGreg got into a couple of private classes before he was booted out.\n\nWhere he seems to have bragged about designing some Scientology electronics.\n\nScientologists do have a habit of following people around with cameras, hoping to blackmail or discredit them.\n\nBut that's not the end of the scientology attacks on Carlos.\n\nRichard DeMille, the idiot \"debunker\" was a scientologist.  It's said he even aided L. Ron Hubbard in kidnapping his wife.\n\nOdd no one mentions that when they reference DeMille for \"proof\" Carlos was a fraud.\n\nI like his \"best point\".\n\nTo debunk Carlos.\n\n\"Even a skilled surgeon couldn't sew the eyes of a lizard shut.\"\n\nWait...\n\nYou mean, the TALKING LIZARD????\n\nThat's what's bothering Demille.  The difficult surgery?\n\nIt talks!!!\n\nMaybe...\n\nIt was never actually a lizard in the first place.\n\nMaybe, it's just Minx?\n\nOne of the Allies Carlos left to his private class.\n\nI've had him in my living room, as a big lizard.  And his fingernails are as naseauting as Carlos said they were.\n\nHe's much more fun as a squirrel.\n\nBut in either form, Minx wouldn't mind at all if you sewed his eyelids shut.\n\nWhatever makes for longer interactions, is fine by her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The New Carlos (Robert Redford)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"gneen9e0kk9b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gneen9e0kk9b1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9307181f092b4b6b72835f5a355f08cc9cd00ea6"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gneen9e0kk9b1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb694b5ee280e24999c57921e2628cf48031d27b"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gneen9e0kk9b1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68e5c3330f697f1f6ed085c70cd4841cf4979ccc"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gneen9e0kk9b1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=443eb3331099e30f37080a92770e03d333d9b465"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gneen9e0kk9b1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6aea7d1b50d4cd301ab607ffa8495fe17b40ba80"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gneen9e0kk9b1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13f0a7ade1735e65e17bf1902e0dccc422713f75"}], "s": {"y": 3072, "x": 3072, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gneen9e0kk9b1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2583dbed807e0074a9bcf9f1178a61e283bf1b60"}, "id": "gneen9e0kk9b1"}}, "name": "t3_14or4ev", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/hsnhoyvwSqtWJ1rF62CiC-sfAzlKlM4iQ304wuOm3bE.jpg", "edited": 1688312570.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1688311854.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gneen9e0kk9b1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2583dbed807e0074a9bcf9f1178a61e283bf1b60\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/gneen9e0kk9b1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2583dbed807e0074a9bcf9f1178a61e283bf1b60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The new face scan add-on for my animation tools came out yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Allowing me to rescan pics of Robert Redford, the one person Carlos selected to play himself in any future movies.

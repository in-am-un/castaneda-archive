One time I became curious what was going on with former Carlos class members, read some of the stuff they posted on the web, and I got an instant bad reaction.  I just \"knew\" they were still fully stuck in their own internal dialogue.\n\nI think it's related to Carlos' \"syntactic commands\".  You read something, and it just \"feels\" like someone is trying to manipulate you with ideas that are on the surface level. Not true things that sound good on paper.\n\nBut I couldn't explain what the rule is for when something feels wrong.  Carlos used to react to stuff in that manner. Some people even got kicked out for talking like that (like Ra).  \n\nCarlos eventually came up with \"the fliers\", maybe to help explain his negative reaction to what amounts to just a collection of words.  He started calling it, \"The fliers mind\".    If you think about it, it's a lot easier to accuse someone of being dominated by the flier's mind, than it is to explain what's objectional about something they said.\n\nAs for the presence of universal self you mentioned, I spent a lot of years practicing mantric meditation.  I even resort to it to this day, if I'm too tired to force silence.   If you learn to become silent with a moderate amount of effort, you can do the same thing to a lesser extent while practicing mantric meditation. Force out thoughts, but let the mantra go on, to make it a little easier to sustain.  So if you're too tired to sit up and force silence, you can lay  there being \"mostly\" silent.  It produces a weird composite technique.\n\nBefore you add that background silence, meditation does seem to lead to something like you've described.  But once you add background silence to mantric style meditation, it seems to result in abstract dreaming.  Or, maybe it's a technique for moving the assemblage point when you're relatively silent.\n\nI guess the Buddhists would say it takes you down \"side paths\".  I'm a big fan of side paths.\n\nThat's also around the level at which Patanjali's sutras seem to function.  Some sort of feeling of oneness, combined with echos of thoughts.   He has a set of 20 or 30 that produce a specific (predicted) result.  I have no doubt those teach people to manipulate intent.\n\nFor instance, you get into a certain state of consciousness (a little below \"bliss\"), and say, \"Pole Star\", then be silent (instructions from some yoga schools say, \"think the sutra, then return to self\".  \n\nIf you're lucky, you'll get a vision of stars and their relationships from that sutra.  I guess it's the old \"kung fu\" movie gag where the master gives you the unattainable scroll, and you get super powers just from what's written on it.\n\nPatanjali has one in there for shrinking yourself down,  super strength, and my favorite, \"inner lights\".  Carlos was sort of teaching those when he created \"the wall\" technique.  Finding the wall uses the first 2 colors associated with Patanjali (purple and red), and then reading off the wall sort of uses the final 2 colors (white and the blue pearl), which are said to be more intense and smaller.\n\n(Sorry for rambling on)\n\n\n\n\n", "edited": 1551114456.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_eh95yzr", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your critique.

I loved it and still do; I regard it as a masterpiece which can stand by itself.\n\nDuring the three decades since that first reading, I've studied many other teachings in depth. At the bottom of all of those teachings is the idea that there is one source of existence. The One has many other names but they all are singular, such as *intent*, *infinity*, *the spirit* or *the abstract.* All spiritual paths I've studied are about *clearing the connecting link to intent* as Carlos writes or *finding the gateway* or *opening the door to intelligent infinity* as Ra says (in *The Law of One*). I wonder if the the true meaning of the word *sorce-ry* is reconnecting to Source.\n\nIntelligent infinity conceived of finity and hence many-ness. Manifold creation consists of pairs of opposites or dualities as a necessary condition for freedom. So if a finite being seeks connection with the infinite, it must bring its manifold being into a state resembling the singular Source. The only way to do this is to achieve balance. When all imbalances are balanced, an equilibrium is achieved which is the finite state most resembling the One.\n\nAs Ra says:\n\n&gt;The prerequisite of mental work is the ability to retain silence of self at a steady state when required by the self. The mind must be opened like a door. The key is silence. Within the door lies an hierarchical construction you may liken unto geography and in some ways geometry, for the hierarchy is quite regular, bearing inner relationships.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The disciplines of the mind involve, first of all, identifying both those things of which you approve and those things of which you disapprove within yourself, and then balancing each and every positive and negative charge with its equal. The mind contains all things. Therefore, you must discover this completeness within yourself. The second mental discipline is acceptance of the completeness within your consciousness.\n\nTherefore, inner silence is only the first step. It is a position of consciousness that some teachers describe as \"the witness platform\". From there, the self can be examined impartially and brought into balance. This might be what don Juan refers to as *stalking the self*.

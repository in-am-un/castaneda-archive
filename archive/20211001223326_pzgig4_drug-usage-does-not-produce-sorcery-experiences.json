He wanted an \"informant\" on the use of power plants.\n\nA popular topic among anthropologists in the early 60s.\n\nDon Juan barely,  or perhaps not at all,  used power plants on his other apprentices.  The Genaros and the Little Sisters.\n\nPeople read the early books of Carlos, get on a weird ego trip, and then run around taking drugs pretending to be doing sorcery.\n\nBut they seem to have a problem with reading comprehension.\n\nThe drugs moved his assemblage point. They do that.\n\nBut the actual \"sorcery experience\" was Little Smoke and Devil's Weed.\n\nLittle Smoke created the techniques we use in this subreddit!\n\nAnd Devil's Weed is a buddy to Cholita for now. Possibly he's had a hand in here too.  I'm not sure. They can masquerade as another entity if it's helpful.\n\nThose are visible entities, which  you can use to teach students!\n\nThey've been with our sorcery lineage for perhaps as long as 800 years.\n\nThe drugs didn't really do the sorcery demonstration.\n\nIt was them. The Allies.\n\nMy theory is, the rituals were actually designed to weaken the effects of the drugs used, not make them stronger.\n\nYou just need the assemblage point shifted to the red station, and then Devil's Weed entity or Little Smoke can take over.  They do that for me all the time, with results even more cool than the stories in the books of Carlos.\n\nDrug free.\n\nAll kinds of weird stuff happens at the Red station, but well designed teaching of the sorcery type requires an entity.\n\nTaking drugs and pretending to be doing the same thing, won't produce any useful results.\n\nIt's also very much missing the point of sorcery.\n\nIf you had an Ally, perhaps you could use that, along with the drugs.\n\nBut you'd never get into the assemblage points positions in the front. Those require PERFECT silence.  Not a temporarily traumatized brain, as the drugs produce.\n\nEven down at the red line, you'd be too stoned to gain any benefit from what you saw during the drug induced experience.\n\nBenefit = able to do that again, so that it's life transforming.\n\nI can assure you, Grateful Dead concert goers from the 90s, are not more evolved than those who did not do that activity.\n\nAnd they had the finest LSD made.  From the Maestro himself (Owsley).\n\nThe drug pushes the assemblage point towards a fixed destination.  Shrooms to the red zone, THC to the green zone. Alcohol possibly stays in the blue zone mostly, and shifts right.\n\nBut the good stuff is on the other side of the body. Can't get there with drugs.\n\nEven your Ally won't like helping you go over there.

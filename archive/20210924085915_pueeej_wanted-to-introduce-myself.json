It got me so excited last night, I tried to \"preserve\" my memory of it, in private chat.\n\nLast night I was continuing to try to master remote viewing.  To be able to remote view for hours, without a break.  To use in shamanic drum circles, to help others see magic before they're able to do it themselves.\n\nI can get my walls and bedspread covered over in unfocused whitish light with heavy texture.\n\nI know that stuff forms into scenes, which is my goal.  But getting it to focus is the hard part lately.  When it happens by accident, it's in focus.  But when you try to do it on purpose,  you mess up the intent of it.  It's like having a child who does really cool tricks.  But your friends come to visit, and you order him, \"DO YOUR TRICK!\".\n\nNope.  He won't.\n\nIntent is a tiny bit like that.\n\nThe whitish light is what you use to \"read off the wall\",  \"see energy on a horizon\", and all the good stuff.\n\nIt is in fact, how don Juan could \"see\" when he did his stage tricks and saw something from the past of Carlos, like the button nosed boy.\n\nSorcerers don't do anything special, except eliminate their internal dialogue.\n\nIt's not like they can use their super powers of concentration to force knowledge of something that happened 40 years ago.\n\nAll they do is become aware they need more information, and gaze at the whitish light.\n\nIf intent is on their side (it usually is for a real sorcerer), text will give them what they need to know. Or a little picture will do it.  I suppose they can also fall into silent Knowledge, where you just \"know\" in some abstract way you can't define.\n\nBut the info still comes from intent, not the sorcerer.\n\nI was gazing at the whitish light, but it would not focus.\n\nAnd in fact, I was still hiding out from Fancy a little.  So I hadn't done enough tensegrity to make it easy.\n\nThere's no Cholita around to pull me out of trouble!  She's \"ended the cycle of abuse\" by moving in with what is possibly an old Carlos business contact.\n\nLily showed up and did a little \"show\" in the air, so I'd know it was her and not Fancy.    She was swimming between the lines of whitish light, like they were strings hanging in the air.\n\nI gazed at her as long as I could, as she moved about, hoping it would cause me to be able to bring the remote viewing into focus, so I could see a real place.\n\nBut Lily kept moving back.  Away from me.   At first up to the wall, then behind the wall, and then she got smaller and smaller until she was too far outside the room to see.\n\nThere was  a little sparkle out there.  Just a flicker, but it was right where Lily was when I last saw her in the distance.\n\nI gazed at that, and suddenly it bloomed into a memory of the past.  I suppose it was more of what Lily had promised to teach me.  How to leave the darkroom by entering a dream.\n\nBut this one was more than a memory. It was a feeling.  A strong feeling that tied up a portion of my energy at some points in my life, when I was very young.    An awareness trap of sorts.\n\nJust as much as an argument with a person, or an embarrassing situation that echoes in your internal dialogue, this had caught up some of my energy.\n\nThat's why we recapitulate.  To get that \"tied up\" energy back, so we can use it in the darkroom.\n\nBut this feeling was happy.  As a child, I had learned to summon the abstract, by standing near a corner at  the grocery store.  It was a corner which often had little whirlwinds blowing papers around, because of the shape of the walls and sidewalk.  On one side it was lighter, with a reddish tint, and on the other side it was darker.   A nice contrast was easily visible. I could stand between them, and summon this feeling as if it were one of the whirlwinds that spun there very often.\n\nI spun in the whirlwind watching that scene as I am now, gazing off far past the walls.\n\n(It's abstract, so this isn't quite accurate).\n\nI realized, seeing energy doesn't require focusing your awareness here, in front of you.  \n\nNear you.\n\nOr even now.\n\nYou can gaze into the past, and put in the same amount of effort to try to get the whitish light to turn into something, and come into sharp focus.\n\nBut  until it comes into focus you aren't sure if you are really looking at anything.\n\nWhich is why, a perfectly dark room is ideal. If you see light, it's magic!\n\nYour vague stuff is like that.  Don't doubt it.  Your \"skimmings\" just didn't become complete.  Possibly you interfered with them a little out of excitement.\n\nTrying to repeat it, will interfere even more.\n\nBut what can we do?

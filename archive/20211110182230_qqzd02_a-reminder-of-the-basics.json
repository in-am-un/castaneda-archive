Seers perceive this mass as a ball of light, like a giant luminous egg, the size of the person's body with the arms extended laterally.\n\n4 Only a very small group of the emanations inside this luminous egg are lit up by a point of intense brilliance located near the egg's surface. This point is where perception is assembled; 'the assemblage point'.\n\n5 Perception occurs when the emanations lit by the assemblage point extend their light to illuminate identical matching emanations outside the egg. Only the emanations lit by the assemblage point are perceived.\n\n6 The assemblage point can move from its usual position to another on the surface or into the interior. It then lights up a new group of emanations making them perceivable and cancelling the former perceptions.\n\n7 When the assemblage point shifts far enough, it makes possible the perception of an entirely different world as objective and factual as the one we normally perceive. Sorcerers go into those other worlds to get energy, power, solutions to general and particular problems, or to face the unimaginable.\n\n8 Intent is the pervasive force that causes us to perceive. We do not become aware because we perceive; rather, we perceive as a result of the pressure and intrusion of intent.\n\n9 The aim of the new seers is to reach a state of total awareness in order to experience all the possibilities of perception available to man. This state of awareness even implies an alternative way of dying.\n\nA level of practical knowledge was included as part of teaching the mastery of awareness. On that practical level don Juan taught the procedures necessary to move the assemblage point.

Don Juan explained that as follows (among other ways):\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOn another occasion, he gave me another kind of explanation. We were discussing an unrelated topic when he abruptly changed the subject and began to tell me a joke. He laughed and very gently patted my back between the shoulder blades; as if he were shy and it was too forward of him to touch me. He chuckled at my nervous reaction.\n\n\"You're skittish,\" he said teasingly, and slapped my back with greater force.\n\nMy ears buzzed. For an instant I lost my breath. It felt as though he had hurt my lungs. Every breath brought me great discomfort. Yet, after I had coughed and choked a few times, my nasal passages opened and I found myself taking deep, soothing breaths.\n\nI had such a feeling of well-being that I was not even annoyed at him for his blow; which had been as hard as it was unexpected.\n\nThen don Juan began a most remarkable explanation. Clearly and concisely, he gave me a different and more precise definition of sorcery.\n\nI had entered into a wondrous state of awareness! I had such clarity of mind that I was able to comprehend and assimilate everything don Juan was saying.\n\nHe said that in the universe there is an unmeasurable, indescribable force which sorcerers call intent, and that absolutely everything that exists in the entire cosmos is attached to intent by a connecting link. Sorcerers, or warriors, as he called them, were concerned with discussing, understanding, and employing that connecting link.\n\nThey were especially concerned with cleaning it of the numbing effects brought about by the ordinary concerns of their everyday lives. Sorcery at this level could be defined as the procedure of cleaning one's connecting link to intent. Don Juan stressed that this 'cleaning procedure' was extremely difficult to understand, or to learn to perform.\n\nSorcerers, therefore, divided their instruction into two categories.\n\nOne was instruction for the everyday-life state of awareness, in which the cleaning process was presented in a disguised fashion.\n\nThe other was instruction for the states of heightened awareness, such as the one I was presently experiencing, in which sorcerers obtained knowledge directly from intent, without the distracting intervention of spoken language.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFortunately, we no longer need a double being, to get to this enhanced awareness state.\n\nBut we may need someone to explain, why it's not quite what we expected.\n\nIt's not less.\n\nIt's more.\n\nToo much!!!\n\nI'm afraid, our account was edited.  Sanitized.\n\nCarlos had already written his books, until don  Juan had left.\n\nThen, he remembered more, and realized he needed to go back to the beginning.\n\nBut there's no way his critics, always trying to destroy the teachings, would not attack on that basis.\n\nAnd they did!  I remember it clearly.  They were drooling with delight.\n\nThey said, he ran out of books to write, so he made up an excuse for a do-over.\n\nIn that do-over, you know Carlos had to be worried a bit.\n\nThe stuff he remembered is outside rationality.\n\nAnd if you are a fan of the books, you know the  universal gossip on the whole deal.\n\nThat don Juan, Silvio Manuel, and Genaro,  had a hand in writing the books.\n\nOr at least, some \"side advice\".\n\nThey \"censored\" the books.\n\nWhen you get to full on heightened awareness, everything will seem pretty much as you expected it.\n\nBut even cooler.\n\nThen comes the weird stuff.\n\nShared heightened awareness.\n\nThat's where it gets weird.\n\nOne sorcerer can take the dreams of 4 apprentices, smash them together, and teach them from within the combined \"dreaming bubble\" thus created.\n\nAnd you're there, in some of the accounts in the books.\n\nThey just don't mention that little detail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What Shared Heightened Awareness Is Like", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intent"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"jqd0mfqa5mk81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jqd0mfqa5mk81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce9b86b5dee82747b0da836cdfe5e331c5bf7cf8"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jqd0mfqa5mk81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18df2353ba4a4e0f2d75f72bbdb9282dd732f32e"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jqd0mfqa5mk81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06b13e992a4a6051c24970de0ecb837314282621"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jqd0mfqa5mk81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15a039a635652ec0c48fd32469c72242c3e0b9d5"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jqd0mfqa5mk81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed1957e4c19b55586c51da897c61aa767dd5dc7d"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jqd0mfqa5mk81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=653538c582dd16dd6d36441173448de67a331ab1"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/jqd0mfqa5mk81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad69b65298f665aba9e10e70d36e5a91528f06cc"}, "id": "jqd0mfqa5mk81"}}, "name": "t3_t3lskz", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/DbjXOFOx2lJcBusjc7Eco1EZJDf_UKiLF7Ukzk6FLiY.jpg", "edited": 1646072119.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1646071731.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jqd0mfqa5mk81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ad69b65298f665aba9e10e70d36e5a91528f06cc\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/jqd0mfqa5mk81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ad69b65298f665aba9e10e70d36e5a91528f06cc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to believe that sorcery is &amp;quot;modified&amp;quot; by each generation a tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the intent of it.

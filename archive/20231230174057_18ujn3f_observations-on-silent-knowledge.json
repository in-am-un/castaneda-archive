It could even be that \"Silent Knowledge Previews\", up in the green and red zones, are not caused externally after all.\n\nIt might be, you found the right attitude.  So you triggered those yourself.\n\nA \"kind\" version of Kylie Fierceness?\n\nI know what it feels like, but I can't describe it.\n\nGenuineness???  \"Will\" even?\n\nSo I can't transfer that knowledge to anyone, perhaps because it's beyond syntax.\n\nOther than to explain that last night I realized that your attitude is also partly responsible for triggering silent knowledge.\n\nBecause your attitude alters where your awareness flows.\n\nI remember Carlos making fun of the Euro-Buddhists, imitating them in the next private class after they had to go home.  He portrayed them as always smelling shit, with their noses upturned a little.\n\nThere's no way to learn magic with that going on!\n\nFor the men though, this post is mostly useless.\n\nBut interesting anyway.  Men will break through things given enough motivation, so they don't necessarily have to have a refined sense of behavior.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI started a new technique last night.\n\nCounting how many times I get to view Silent Knowledge.\n\nKeep in mind, it takes me a minimum of 30 minutes to get there.\n\nA huge improvement from the 2 hours it took a year or two ago.\n\nMy goal is 10 views of \"knowledge\" a night,  minimum.\n\nI try to stick to the recommendations of don Juan, to look for the pomegranate dot and read text.\n\nBut doing that simply selects a different range of \"topics\" for me to view,  all still as videos in the air.\n\nDon Juan told us to avoid the videos in the air approach,  because it was too easy to misinterpret your own \"seeing\".\n\nA good example is when Carlos saw the french poodle while trying to \"see\" deliberately, at the request of don Juan.\n\nThere was pretty much no way to understand that vision.\n\nSo don Juan advised we use text as the \"presentation method\" for knowledge.\n\nBecause it's easier to understand what you just \"read\"?\n\nCarlos did that each private class, and you could see him doing it if you were paying attention.\n\nSometimes even on his palm. He'd look down at his palm and start reading from it.\n\nBut so far those \"videos in the air\" dominate my Silent Knowledge.\n\nAnd what don Juan didn't warn us about is that you are both inside those videos in the air, and outside them.\n\nSo calling them a video in the air, or on the wall, or in the sky, is really just a limited point of view.\n\nIt's incomplete.\n\nYou can deduce that from reading workshop and lecture notes to see how crazy things become when you are an advanced sorcerer, physically traveling to other worlds.\n\nSo to say we ought to try to limit ourselves to reading text is perhaps a trick of some sort.\n\nAnd trying to count 10 of those SK events per session is very confusing at first.\n\nBecause some of them suck you in and you're in another place while experiencing that \"knowledge\".\n\nIt's also a tall order to reach 10 because you run out of dreaming attention.\n\nComplicated by the fact that in Silent Knowledge you aren't \"here\" or \"there\" in relation to the things you get to witness.  And when you are \"there\" and return \"here\", you lose memory of what you were doing for an instant.\n\nIt's probably your double causing that.  You may be sitting up on the bed gazing off into infinity, but your energy body is right there or you couldn't do it.\n\nAnd your energy body doesn't know the difference between \"here\" and \"there\", because it  has no physical matter.\n\nKeep in mind, the very act of counting those \"videos in the sky\"  becomes a presentation method.\n\nIt  influences what happens.\n\nThat's how silent knowledge is.\n\nLast night around #3 cool thing coming from Silent Knowledge, my internal dialogue seemed to have returned.\n\nExcept it was just a single sentence.  I caught the end of it, and put a stop to it.\n\nAt which point the sentence came true!\n\nI was looking at exactly what the sentence had said.\n\nA woman doing an errand at a small corner shopping area.\n\nI could see her mild frustration. She wasn't happy about having to do it.  She had better places to be.\n\nI realized I was inside the vision along with her, next to what could have been the place she needed to visit.\n\nWatching her like a ghost.  I couldn't change anything. But I could see it all.\n\nWhen I returned to sitting up on the bed on pillows, I realized that not all kinds of internal dialogue will push the assemblage point back to the blue line.\n\nPossibly some forms will summon \"topics\" during Silent Knowledge.\n\nIf the \"thought\" is only for an instant, and then you completely drop it.\n\nPerhaps those begin with a description from \"the voice of seeing\" telling you what it is, and then you notice it after the fact.\n\nFrom the bed I tried to look back into the vision to see what the woman was doing now, and noticed that she sighed.\n\nNot quite true, but the closest I can get.\n\nI could feel the sensation of her sigh.  She tilted slightly when she did it. It was almost like, that's what I had needed to see in that vision.\n\nWhile feeling what she felt, silent knowledge vision #5 materialized.\n\nCaused by the \"attitude adjustment\".\n\nI realized, silent knowledge is automatic. \n\nIt's our nature.\n\nIt was taken from us.\n\nBy brainwashing. \n\nBy giving us a \"mood\" that keeps us ignorant of our potential.\n\nSo that practicing darkroom can confuse you into thinking you have to remove **all** traces of what feels normal to you.\n\n\"Undo\" all the pieces of your personality.\n\nBut possibly, that merely summons your double who is sick and tired of \"you\".\n\nAnd if you get rid of \"you\",  your double has every reason to come visit.\n\nYou have the sobriety and sense of purpose. Those can never be acquired outside a physical body.\n\nSo your double wants very much to merge with you and gain tonal rationality for himself.\n\nWhich gives you his powers.\n\nBut not all parts of your personality will hamper your attempts to learn sorcery.\n\nNot all drive the double away.\n\nSome are even fully compatible with Silent Knowledge.\n\nYou get to keep those.\n\nIt's the \"human\" part of you.  Which is NOT the part that trapped us.\n\nThe part that trapped you here includes greed, sorrow, grief, jealousy, and sadness.  \n\nBut other parts of our personality are not artificial constructs, which were merely created by thinking in circles.\n\nSome are the \"real\" human.  The creature you would be, absent language.\n\nThey're impossible to explain but when the woman in that vision tilted her head and signed, she activated one of them.\n\nA positive feature of our humanness.\n\nI duplicated what I understood that feeling to be, and I got silent knowledge vision #6.\n\nI suppose, it's the part of you which notices something beautiful as you are walking along, and stops to admire it.\n\nWith no ulterior motives.\n\nDon Juan demonstrated it for us, in the book where he was leaving that evening, and Carlos walked around with him while he gazed at ordinary things. Such as the patterns in a brick wall.\n\nFocusing your awareness is ok.\n\nIt's the motivations behind where you focus it, which are the problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Observations on Silent Knowledge", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"nwk39nlgeg9c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nwk39nlgeg9c1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49724b72a043c9c7a49e2dfec7d40cd9a6270d31"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nwk39nlgeg9c1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93fddc831929d36f44f8346161ef32bf6b277dd7"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nwk39nlgeg9c1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b047dbfd50346967a6d052897070f4321cbc029f"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nwk39nlgeg9c1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33d524db58a05eb1239aad8ac725a5060f817ff2"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nwk39nlgeg9c1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec297cf37e4252c2cc41fa99df7f8aad8fc2178d"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nwk39nlgeg9c1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93127bfb031ea281f555f87303d8cc857ec39b2d"}], "s": {"y": 4096, "x": 4096, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/nwk39nlgeg9c1.jpg?width=4096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eedbc5efb0bd093bd01687ba1630a95e601fd56"}, "id": "nwk39nlgeg9c1"}}, "name": "t3_18ujn3f", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 29, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 29, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Gws7j8W-QKtRmI-9fMO6d6sVvXPYqOL1BUJNVzvxvsc.jpg", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1703954457.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nwk39nlgeg9c1.jpg?width=4096&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2eedbc5efb0bd093bd01687ba1630a95e601fd56\"&gt;If you find spelling errors the same day, I can update facebook and reddit.

When you're observing any type of dreaming bubble containing a dream/vision, silent knowledge, or a IOB even, you need \"dreaming attention\" to even register what you're seeing. You have I guess to \"cheat\" and use parts of that tonal awareness. And using tonal awareness to alter or overwatch, whatever the double sees, is merging the two. But you also run the risk of moving slowly back to the blue zone. It is as if the act of \"noting\" or \"trying to remember later\" or \"learning\" ruins whatever you're doing slowly. That's why you usually only remember the last amazing thing that happened.

When you&amp;#39;re observing any type of dreaming bubble containing a dream/vision, silent knowledge, or a IOB even, you need &amp;quot;dreaming attention&amp;quot; to even register what you&amp;#39;re seeing. You have I guess to &amp;quot;cheat&amp;quot; and use parts of that tonal awareness. And using tonal awareness to alter or overwatch, whatever the double sees, is merging the two. But you also run the risk of moving slowly back to the blue zone.

A life free from suffering and the attainment of eternal happiness is what we want. Now, we should discriminate and analyze if there is anything in the world which can give us permanent, eternal happiness. From the ant up to the giant of the Creator, all are in the field of change, that is, relative values. Infinite happiness can only come from something which could be immortal, non-changing, eternal. This which is the goal of everything, this infinite, is our own Self. And in order to experience that Self which is the basis of all, we don't have to seek, we don't have to search, we don't have to make efforts. It's there, present everywhere. **Wherever you are, in whatever reign of time or place, that Self is there\u2013wherever we are in whatever time. Only, we have to take our awareness to that level and that is it. Having forgotten that level of life, we are seeking for that eternal happiness. That Self is.**\n\nIt is being and it is blissful. Having forgotten that, we now are seeking for it. We have forgotten what we ourselves are and we're trying to find that in the world. As long as we don't enter into that area which is infinite happiness, free from suffering, so long we will not be free from suffering and we will not get into that eternal happiness. There is no happiness of significant nature in the world; the child is gone, and the youth is gone, and the man is old, and even then he is not fulfilled in the world. When he gets established in the Self, then automatically freedom from suffering and attainment of bliss will be there. **That which is omnipresent doesn't have to be sought. It's there already. Start to be. That which is omnipresent is not to be sought; only our awareness has to be brought to that level and that bliss is there. You don't have to seek it.** Understand? Unless we get into that omnipresent bliss, satisfaction is not going to come. If it were to come, it would have come by now through so many avenues in the world. But, it has not.\n\nTherefore, that which is the Self is your own being. You don't have to look in the outside. And, it is irrespective of any religious faiths or beliefs; Christians or Mormons or Hindus\\*\\*. That being is the knowledge itself. Only, you have to know.\\*\\* All these various manifestations of happiness that we experience in the world, they also are the manifestations of the same eternal being which is our own Self. If we are aware of the Self, if we know it, fine. Otherwise, we have to be. **And, therefore, it is necessary to bring our awareness deep within ourselves. As deeply as we can bring our awareness to the Self, so intensely we can inherit that which is omnipresent in our day to day life.** Having known that Self we will be eternally contented; remaining in the world we will live contentment. And, it\u2019s not a matter of detaching ourselves from the world. **Only, we have to know It, and having known It, then, all different manifestations in the world will be experienced as manifestations of That. We don't have to detach ourselves.**\n\n**It is just a matter of bringing the awareness to that area, and be, and live it.** Having gained this beautiful, perfect human nervous system, if we have known that element of the Self, then we have really used this wonderful diamond-like gift, this diamond-like **nervous system** which is capable of giving that eternal bliss. If it is not experienced, then we have wasted that gift of diamond. **We have taken upon ourselves this human nervous system, not for the sake of petty enjoyment of changing nature in this relative field of change, but to live and be that infinite bliss.** And, we will have to attain that thing whether we attain it in this life, or in the next, or in the next. We just can't forego that. Therefore, with the assistance of the guru and the scriptures, better to attain it quickly.

They stand out as not being part of other cultures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In India, it&amp;#39;s almost obvious why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a market for street magicians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such a cool thing, a street magician!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But harmful to seeking the truth, because street magicians have to come up with tricks they can actually do, in front of others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those get added on to the esoteric folklore, so that it&amp;#39;s hard to hear about a Yogi, and see that he fits the pattern of real magic as it occurs world wide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate to name a few of their add-ons, because some got picked up elsewhere, so it&amp;#39;s not as obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, living off light and morning dew is one of them.  The guy who doesn&amp;#39;t eat or drink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d go for the guy who looks too young, but our own form of magic makes that claim for some.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daoists love that claim. Howard Lee once told me, maybe people don&amp;#39;t believe him now, but when he lives to 150, they&amp;#39;ll start to listen to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About Howard:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just Hong Kong Daoism.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Common among the 5 main countries Daoist sorcerers fled to, after WWII.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_mvtxxo", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mvtxxo/another_sorcerer_tat_wale_baba/gvhj68j/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1619123114.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1619123114.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gvkl36h", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1619189094.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gvi8j4i", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Meditation will work, if you do what you are doing.\n\nThat is, pay attention to weird stuff and try to get more, instead of ignoring it as most systems teach.\n\nI don't think it will put any limits on you to stick with that, as long as you read in here, so you understand what's actually going on.

I wish we&amp;#39;d accumulated them in a more straightforward manner, because after you read all of them, it&amp;#39;s very obvious what each of us needs to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all meditation systems I&amp;#39;ve seen, simply interrupt that dialogue. With matra, contemplation, weird breathing or movement, or even dancing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s complicated to reach some yogi&amp;#39;s level,  or you don&amp;#39;t get an answer, you have something seriously wrong going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did get an honest answer out of one famous Indian spiritualist, Shakurpani.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He admitted, yes.  You only need to get rid of that internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he added, &amp;quot;But no one can do that!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously he was wrong on that part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your yogi was soaking up attention, that&amp;#39;s all. Hit the big time, and got promoted, perhaps because of his proximity to Maharashi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not hard to teach others, if you really understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hard part is finding people who will work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the hard part is explaining what they need to do, it means, the person doesn&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or he&amp;#39;s part of a system (like Zen), which has chosen to deliberately slow down students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or he&amp;#39;s motivated by money, and can&amp;#39;t afford to tell people they have to work several hours a day to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe not enough stick around after that, to keep you from having to get a job?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone reading this, even years later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DON&amp;#39;T BE A SUCKER!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go find the students of anyone who interests you, and see what they learned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, why are you even interested?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to do some hero worship, go worship Howard Hughes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or Elon Musk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But some guy who lives in a cave, and is unable to teach others what he supposedly is famous for?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t get the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if that still sounds good, try Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t beat that  book deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;66 books, all now classics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus apocrypha...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he also can&amp;#39;t explain how to do what he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, not so you can actually do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_mvtxxo", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mvtxxo/another_sorcerer_tat_wale_baba/gvhxakl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1619129259.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1619129259.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gvhdiz4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "BlueSpheroid__", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gvhd62h", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6lc9zzq3", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Yeah that is the problem with Baba.

I&amp;#39;m trying to figure this thing out.  &amp;quot;The don&amp;#39;t criticize or post pictures of clowns&amp;quot;, thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s gone into &amp;quot;Silent Running&amp;quot; mode, since I paid her reparations for using the baseball bat in here, and she rewarded me with at least 2 magical appearances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably 3, but seeing her in two apartment windows, up high, at the same time, is rather confusing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she enjoyed the reparations a little too fast, and started casting spells.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if she complains about criticizing people again, I can bribe her again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mvtxxo/another_sorcerer_tat_wale_baba/gvh379w/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1619116252.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_mvtxxo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gvejdr4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gvehs2k", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Ok, on your second sentence.\n\nBut the a.p. doesn't have configurations.

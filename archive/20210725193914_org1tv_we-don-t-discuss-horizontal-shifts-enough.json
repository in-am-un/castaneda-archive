And they're so bizarre, you feel on shaky ground to even talk about it.\n\nBut they do in fact cause shapeshifting.\n\nMy guess: Always.  You just don't notice it most of the time.\n\nSo I'll speculate:\n\nAt the blue line, horizontal shifts take place. We know so!  Carlos explained it.  Women go back and forth during their periods.  A fever causes a shift.  A bad mood, or being elated, is caused by the assemblage point shifting.\n\nNow the green line...  Carlos said nothing about horizontal shifts there, as far as I recall.\n\nBut I'm going to assume that since horizontal shifts also take place at the red line, as verified by Carlos, that they happen at ALL levels.\n\nEven at the end of the J curve, don Juan commented he prefers a slight left shift.\n\nSo, in my picture of what the green line is like, those antique toy dolls sort of show what I would expect.\n\nIn the middle, they would be a little dream.  Probably a short one.  If you have a lot of energy, you'll jar yourself out of the mini-dream by being surprised, and planning a new chapter for your book deal entitled, \"The Antique Dolls\".\n\nNot much of a chapter, so you'll have to make up the rest.  There's plenty of that going on in the Castaneda fake sorcery book world.\n\nOddly, the women's books are the worst.  You'd think the men, but in fact, in the world of fake sorcery books, the women don't hold back.\n\nBut if you can fight off your urge to please other people, I suggest that green line \"visions\" would be peaceful, like a lucid dream dominated by bliss.\n\nUnless...\n\nYou have shifted horizontally.\n\nFancy (a \"missing\" inorganic being of mine) taught me, to shift horizontally you pick something you see that \"isn't there\", and pretend it's real.  Play with it, as if it were absolutely as real as your daily world.\n\nThe Tensegrity does that a little.  But if you can't see it, I can't explain it.\n\nThat's the whole point of Tensegrity, other than to \"redeploy\" energy closer to the middle, so you can form the energy body.\n\nTensegrity is like Hogwarts school of magic.\n\nBut until recently, it was more like the classes they make you take if you get a DUI.\n\nSo a horizontal shift on the green line means, whatever you perceive will be more \"real\".\n\nLike in that picture.  The dolls aren't a vision anymore.   They're getting a little aggressive.\n\nBut with all the bliss, there's no fear.\n\nAt the red line, in the middle, and especially if you've dropped all the way to the bottom, magic is abundant.\n\nIt's spectacular!\n\nNot that way for you?  Let me suggest, you didn't go down the middle.\n\nYou went at a diagonal, and are hanging out too much on the right side.\n\nDown there, on the right side of the deep red zone, you can turn into a baboon, and not even notice it.\n\nYou can come out of it, look at your hands, and they're on fire.  But all you think is, \"Can I turn that into the 4th chapter of my book deal?\"\n\n\"Hands On Fire\" might be even more entertaining than \"The Antique Dolls\".\n\nBy the way, what's the cure for the book deal mind?\n\nAt least, a vaccine.  You might get the D variant of the book deal mind, but at least you won't end up in the hospital too long.\n\nThe vaccine for the book deal mind, is doing magic everyday for hours until there's so many tiny book deals swimming in your blood, it doesn't seem worth picking one or two and actually trying to impress others with those.\n\nThere's too many to even remember at that point.\n\nYou have anti-book bodies in your blood steam.\n\nThat's the cure.  Actually becoming a sorcerer.\n\nSo here's a tip:  If they wrote a book, they aren't sorcerers.\n\n\"But Carlos and the Witches wrote a book!!!\"\n\nWell that doesn't mean you have to!  What it really means is, you don't need to.\n\nYou're off the hook!\n\nDon't see it that way?\n\nThen you're not a sorcerer yet, and have no business writing a book.\n\nI blamed Cholita for the baboon, over here on

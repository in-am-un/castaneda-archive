In that pic I mean, on the lower right.\n\nNot that she threw up in the trash can.\n\nI do like that in a woman.\n\nBut there wasn't a trash can when it happened. I just took that room shot off the web.\n\nI had to censor the picture I found to represent Fairy in a Japanese Sailor Suit, but the real thing was a lot sexier than that, even if I hadn't blanked out her underwear.\n\nIt was entirely see through.\n\nShe ODed on red line energy and materialized by my dresser, where I'd just created those red lines you see.\n\nThose are in fact a pretty good representation, especially the feeling of electricity the blurry colors from jpeg artifacts give off.\n\nWasn't my idea at all for Fairy to get involved, but I didn't mind!\n\nI upset a few people over that.\n\nI guess IOBs are supposed to be either scary or boring.\n\nNot fairy...\n\nAnd not any IOB you're likely to find.\n\nThey're all potentially sexy.\n\nOr scary.\n\nGiven a choice, they want to be whatever is the most intense for you.\n\nI left out a few types of lines here. It got too crowded in that picture.\n\nNow let me get back to luring all of you with the rewards of practicing!\n\nSee that beautiful young woman there?\n\nI really, really, really had her in my bedroom, all alone with me, and passed out on the floor.\n\nAnd she was much brighter than that! I had to dim that picture, because the model might recognize herself and complain.\n\nI have no idea why I didn't pick Fairy up and put her on the bed where she belonged.\n\nBut the important thing is, I could have.\n\nShe wouldn't mind at all!\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t like that look, you\u2019ll suddenly find that she looks just like another woman you were thinking about.\n\nGod only knows what I was thinking that night!\n\nToo bad you just don't think of taking advantage of a great situation, when you're silent enough to pull off that flying technique.\n\nThen later on, you do think about why you didn\u2019t take advantage.\n\nSo now you have something to look forward to.\n\nThat's the reward. Later on.\n\nIsn't that always the way with potential mates?\n\nOn the left in that image you see a hand waving in the air. And if you look closely, you\u2019ll see dark waves.\n\nDark waves have an echo. Those are 2 dark waves, and they have 2 dark echos.\n\nThe dark part of the line is darker than the dreaming fog. The light part is only slightly lighter than the dark part. It\u2019s almost like the dark wave creates a weaker second wave.\n\nBut you don\u2019t even need dreaming fog to see those dark lines!\n\nJust wave your hand up and down.\n\nIf the room is pitch black, and you have been silent at least 10 minutes, you ought to see them.\n\nThose will train you to recognize \u201cdark energy\u201d, and also to see the luminous body more easily.\n\nThe vague lines on the wall have been explained in a previous post. \u201cThe Wall\u201d, a special technique given by Carlos in order to allow us to utilize the second attention, is a seers assistant.\n\nIt can do many things. One is to become a viewing window for another world.\n\nSometimes you get to enter.\n\nThe yellow line streaking across is a little misleading. Typically, you\u2019re looking down at one you came across. So you can\u2019t see where it came from.\n\nAnd because it takes such a deep gaze to even see that, a hypnotic sort of thing, you don\u2019t turn your head to see how far off it goes.\n\nIt\u2019s odd. It\u2019s like you just \u201cknow\u201d about the line, and don\u2019t have a need to test it.\n\nMaybe Mr. DoubleTake never even gets notice. And he\u2019s the one who makes you so suspicious you\u2019d start measuring the line.\n\nBut it is fully visible!\n\nI\u2019d say that pics even a slightly reduced brightness.\n\nAnd they show up in all kinds of things.\n\nYou can even see them coming from your torso during recapitulation, if you do your recapitulation in Heightened Awareness.\n\nWhich is what all these techniques in darkness lead to.\n\nJust recapitulate in the darkness, eyes open.\n\nYou\u2019ll see that they weren\u2019t making it up. You really do retrieve, and send out fibers of light, which have feelings associated with them.\n\nMaybe we need to step up our recapitulation games. Last time I recapitulated, I didn\u2019t have that ability to *see* the emanations.\n\nThe puddle on the floor is somewhat like the effect produced with the Tensegrity move, \u201cMashing Energy\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a good test of your silence.\n\nIf you can both see, and somewhat scoop puffs of color, you might be able to see the results of Mashing Energy.\n\nThey\u2019re very fibrous, compared to other Tensegrity moves that produce balls of light.\n\nThe bright yellow lines are something you could easily see, if you had been practicing at least 2 hours, were in full Heightened Awareness as evidenced by your breathing and off the chart bliss levels.\n\nYou sit comfortably on pillows, like a westernized meditation geek who can\u2019t do lotus position.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the cool things about sorcery. There\u2019s no dress code.\n\nGaze down, hands resting on your knees, while you force out the last hint of interpretation.\n\nYou\u2019re already silent. There are no images in your mind. Your assemblage point has moved all the way to the end of that J shaped curve, and you have bliss and automatic breathing.\n\nBut you still take the time to understand what you are perceiving.\n\nYou\u2019re reacting to it!  Maybe that\u2019s the same as \u201cfeeling it\u201d.\n\nAnd sorcery is all about feelings.\n\nSo ditch those too. Make sure you have no opinion on anything before you.\n\nJust as reality is about to collapse and send you to the control room, you see something glitter.\n\nTurns out, you do in fact still care about something!\n\nThose amazing yellow lines.\n\nThey are best viewed with a warning.\n\nYou\u2019ll blank out in a few seconds.  You aren't used to looking at that level of reality.\n\nIt uses up energy fast.\n\nAnd you'll never know where you went.\n\nNow for the best part. You always put the sex at the end.\n\nI was unwilling to pee into my own hands, in order to try La Gorda\u2019s technique.\n\nI sort of had an agreement from Cholita that she\u2019d pee for me.\n\nAnd that created a problem.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to instruct someone in how to pee in their hands, so we can do some magic, and then not have it work.\n\nThat kind of thing got Carlos into trouble too!\n\nBut I'm sure it all made sense at the time.\n\nEven so, it tends to ruin your reputation.\n\nI had to try it myself, first. There was no other way.\n\nMy memory of that event isn\u2019t very good, but I posted it.\n\nI believe I\u2019d been using Fairy to help me redeploy energy, then I got some water and flicked it into the air, trying to see a trail left by the droplets.\n\nThe problem was, just flicking my fingers shot out visible sparks and yellow lines like the one in that image.\n\nI tried it a few times, in different directions, until I got to the chest of drawers.\n\nIt stretched up too high! It was completely distorted, as if sucked up into the air.  The dresser was 16 feet high at that point!\n\nBut I didn\u2019t realize that. I just had the feeling that if I really put some \u201cflick\u201d into flinging water, this time it would work.\n\nAnd 2 brilliant red lines burned in front of me. They were a bit move violent than that picture, sort of humming at perfect angles every foot or so of their length,  which kept switching. Like a bunch of flat Zs in the air. And yet also straight.\n\nIt faded away and I noticed Fairy passed out on the floor. Her head was leaning down, so it was as if she\u2019d returned to one of her shrouded corpse looks. Except her shroud was a Japanese sailor suit, completely see through.\n\nMy reaction was to try to view it from multiple angles, to see if it had the same sort of perspective as real objects.\n\nIt did.\n\nI ended up looking right into her face, and something startled me.\n\nI can\u2019t recall what it was.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Lines You Can See in Darkness", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ix255z33ns051": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ix255z33ns051.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f132cc0cb7d13e582676bbe13081f653494c794"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ix255z33ns051.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcb1517cd2acac8166cec226e26b682d048faee"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ix255z33ns051.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce037badf98bd010d0e4b3e6c8fa532cce1726e6"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ix255z33ns051.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce6da2315cff51f59bf8cd795cb9b5404bffcfb7"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ix255z33ns051.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf7fe4a99b3abc741c5d3ab35d0f90e5d874cdeb"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ix255z33ns051.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af69181300e03f970380d5eabaef94cf76c60743"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ix255z33ns051.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a486b1c42863eaae2b92054b8f6400eba4a9c60"}, "id": "ix255z33ns051"}}, "name": "t3_gpzgtq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/n4ckCMsMVCKmkpVlYOvgVm8GA6TGtIX9u5i0ZOxsRdk.jpg", "edited": 1593969748.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1590361562.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ix255z33ns051.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1a486b1c42863eaae2b92054b8f6400eba4a9c60\"&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t a full list by any means, but you can learn to see and use these.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry about Fairy.

You can step off to the side, and keep that change and find out what kind of world it fits into.\n\nIf someone was pulling you into it deeper, you'd certainly notice the effects.  It would be like someone was rearranging reality around you, visually and physically.\n\nAnd not just physically as you'd imagine, but your very feelings on the inside of your body and thoughts will change.\n\nI supposed the closest comparison is \"rushing\" while smoking too much pot.\n\nDo people even do that these days?  Might have been a 70s thing.\n\nBut your sense of being \"here\" can still be preserved as your assemblage point moves, as long as the movement remains on the same vertical slope as our normal position (doesn't shift laterally too much).\n\nSo for example, even if you can move your assemblage point all the way to the end of the J curve, you feel like yourself all along the way, if it remains on that path Carlos traced with his finger.\n\nIf you deviate, no.\n\nAnd if you move it very low and deviate, you shape shift.\n\nThat's why Cholita could crush me if she became silent.", "edited": 1593791119.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fwtaxbo", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s all kinds of stuff happening at other layers of the onion.

At least it looks and feels that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if you&amp;#39;re practicing in the middle of the night to get the darkness, they help keep you from falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you keep practicing and moving the assemblage point, all tiredness goes away at the end of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except I suppose, if you have cancer or something, the way Carlos did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how Elias moved Julian&amp;#39;s assemblage point so far that he couldn&amp;#39;t die, but Carlos must not have known how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone is wondering what that might feel like, I&amp;#39;ve been chasing a gremlin like creature in a tunnel. I hadn&amp;#39;t realized it, but it was a tunnel Carlos told us about in class, several times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was hoping to skip furrows and heal himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you go into it, you change. You can step off to the side, and keep that change and find out what kind of world it fits into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone was pulling you into it deeper, you&amp;#39;d certainly notice the effects.  It would be like someone was rearranging reality around you, visually and physically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And not just physically as you&amp;#39;d imagine, but your very feelings on the inside of your body and thoughts will change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I supposed the closest comparison is &amp;quot;rushing&amp;quot; while smoking too much pot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do people even do that these days?  Might have been a 70s thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But your sense of being &amp;quot;here&amp;quot; can still be preserved as your assemblage point moves, as long as the movement remains on the same vertical slope as our normal position (doesn&amp;#39;t shift laterally too much).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for example, even if you can move your assemblage point all the way to the end of the J curve, you feel like yourself all along the way, if it remains on that path Carlos traced with his finger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you deviate, no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you move it very low and deviate, you shape shift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why Cholita could crush me if she became silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gpzgtq", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gpzgtq/lines_you_can_see_in_darkness/fwtaxbo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1593790839.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1593790839.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fwutq5y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Zazzy-z", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fwtfdm6", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_72ilaw5n", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "If you check out the magical passes from workshops on oocity, (or is it oocities?

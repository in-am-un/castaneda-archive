Despite my dad being born in 70s   HA&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My grandpa definitely had some sort of interaction or at least knew of Carlo\u2019s work. He was deep into the hippy movement and led an extremely solid, hardworking life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact I am sure he had some sort of knowledge given what I remember of him.

Everything they have is virtually childish.\n\nAnd it helps me figure out things I'd missed.\n\nLet's take Gordon Wasson, the mycologist who \"officially\" stated, you don't smoke mushrooms.\n\nSounds logical, right?\n\nBut it's not at all!  It only makes sense as an anti-Carlos argument, if you are angry with the guy and will fall for anything.\n\nThe smoking mixture consisted of powdered Mexican mushrooms, which are quite potent.  And I don't think don Juan was worried about how much this would cost at the local drug dealer.\n\nHe was picking them in the wild!  He could probably pick 100 doses if he felt like it, all for free.\n\nHe dried a bunch in a manner that would make even more grow inside the container, since the shroom is basically fine white threads that will grow on most rotting leaves, and he stuffed the ones he wanted into the container before sealing it.\n\nProbably doubled the volume because it resumed growing.  \n\nHe then let it dry, powered it, and mixed it with stuff so you could smoke it.\n\nCarlos was instructed to inhale deeply.\n\nSo here's a question. Do you suppose Gordon Wasson would have taken a deep inhalation from a pipe loaded with Tabaco and powered Mexican mushrooms?\n\nNo way!   You intuitively know you'd get complete smashed!  The power would coat the inside of your mouth, and even go down your throat and into your lungs.\n\nWasson was lying!  He knew that argument was bogus!\n\nBut people still fall for it.\n\nI suppose it's partly because shrooms are very valuable if you don't live where they grow, and only an idiot would waste them that way.\n\nYou could get 8 doses out of them, instead of 1.\n\nBut, ask yourself.  Did Carlos need much of the smoking mixture?\n\nIt wasn't the power plants that gave him those \"intent gifts\" of spectacular magic.\n\nIt was Little Smoke.\n\nNo, not the mixture. That's not little smoke!\n\nLittle smoke is a golf ball sized puff of bright white light, with a few yellow fibers visible in the middle.\n\nShe is literally a, \"little smoke ball\".\n\nAt least, in daylight.  She  used to follow Cholita around like a puppy dog, even obeying her commands.\n\nMy guess is, don Juan \"watered down\" the smoking mixture on purpose.  He wanted Carlos to expect to get super plastered, so he wouldn't be afraid a demon had taken control of him.\n\nLittle Smoke can be very scary, if you think it's a real being. I swore off calling her, before I got tricked into mistaking \"Fairy\" for a new entity.\n\nSo even better than being super strong, mildly powerful would do the job of hiding where the magic was actually coming from.\n\nAn inorganic being.\n\nAnd give Little Smoke more control over his assemblage point.\n\nThe first time I stopped the world, was with the help of Little Smoke.\n\nThe same as Carlos and the talking Coyote.  That was an inorganic being also.\n\nLikely Little Smoke again.\n\nLet's take another silly argument.\n\nHis book said it was a Yaqui way of knowledge, but then later Carlos changed it.\n\nHow do you explain that except as deception?\n\nYou just have to read the storyline!\n\nCarlos wanted to find his own \"information\", to teach him how a particular tribe used power plants.\n\nHe tried at Morongo where they also specialize in Devil's Weed.\n\nBut Lowell Bean already had them in his grip.  And maybe another before my time. I didn't start paying attention there, until 1968. Though I was around there in 1965.\n\nSo Carlos went looking again, and ran into don Juan.\n\nNow, if don Juan had told him, \"Yea, I know some Indian shamanism.  Originally it was Olmec, then they died off or migrated, and it went to the Toltecs.  But the Spanish destroyed their civilization, so the shamanism went to a Catholic Church official, a Chinese pirate, and some local Indians who were either crazy, or down on their luck.\"\n\nCarlos would have left.\n\nSo instead don Juan told him it was from his own tribe, which worked out great because the freeway leading south from LA into Mexico is the bus route that ends at the site of the Yaqui wars in Mexico. Not only would Carlos easily believe it, but if don Juan took him down into Mexico, where they drove to would be consistent with the Yaqui story.\n\nI have no doubt don Juan slapped his back and corrected the lie right away.\n\nBut it took Carlos years to remember what happened in heightened awareness.\n\nWhich any good darkroom gazer can tell you, is true.\n\nOnce you get \"out there\", it's nearly impossible to remember anything later on.\n\nFor instance,  Cholita decided to spend half a day at home.  She fled again somewhere around 4AM, but while I was doing darkroom, Cholita was home.\n\nAt one point I was experimenting with the fastest way to store up energy from the puffs, and noticed a patch of intense purple and blue stuck to the inside of a cave.\n\nMy room had turned into a cave.\n\nI heard Cholita banging the back door, and walking towards the bath.\n\nThe entire room filled with dense purple, likely Cholita's dark energy. She's been pretending to be homeless in Beverly Hills, and seems to have picked up more dark energy than usual.\n\nLily saw me wondering about the purple stuck on the inside of the cave, and explained dark energy in general to me.\n\nShe even showed me to reach up and \"pull\" on it, to see that it attaches itself to things.\n\nIt was somehow related to how women store it.\n\nBut it's all gone.  The entire explanation is impossible to recall.\n\nI only thought about what I do remember, because of writing this.\n\nWhich is one benefit to posting your experiences.  Later you'll look at it and think, \"Oh yea, I did do that!!!  I'd forgotten.\"", "edited": 1627750917.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h77vy65", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sort of enjoy arguing with the &amp;quot;Carlos was thoroughly debunked&amp;quot; types.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they can&amp;#39;t win!

You intuitively know you&amp;#39;d get complete smashed!  The power would coat the inside of your mouth, and even go down your throat and into your lungs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wasson was lying!  He knew that argument was bogus!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But people still fall for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it&amp;#39;s partly because shrooms are very valuable if you don&amp;#39;t live where they grow, and only an idiot would waste them that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could get 8 doses out of them, instead of 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, ask yourself.  Did Carlos need much of the smoking mixture?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t the power plants that gave him those &amp;quot;intent gifts&amp;quot; of spectacular magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was Little Smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, not the mixture. That&amp;#39;s not little smoke!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little smoke is a golf ball sized puff of bright white light, with a few yellow fibers visible in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is literally a, &amp;quot;little smoke ball&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, in daylight.  She  used to follow Cholita around like a puppy dog, even obeying her commands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess is, don Juan &amp;quot;watered down&amp;quot; the smoking mixture on purpose.  He wanted Carlos to expect to get super plastered, so he wouldn&amp;#39;t be afraid a demon had taken control of him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little Smoke can be very scary, if you think it&amp;#39;s a real being. I swore off calling her, before I got tricked into mistaking &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot; for a new entity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So even better than being super strong, mildly powerful would do the job of hiding where the magic was actually coming from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And give Little Smoke more control over his assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time I stopped the world, was with the help of Little Smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same as Carlos and the talking Coyote.  That was an inorganic being also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likely Little Smoke again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take another silly argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His book said it was a Yaqui way of knowledge, but then later Carlos changed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you explain that except as deception?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just have to read the storyline!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos wanted to find his own &amp;quot;information&amp;quot;, to teach him how a particular tribe used power plants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He tried at Morongo where they also specialize in Devil&amp;#39;s Weed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Lowell Bean already had them in his grip.  And maybe another before my time. I didn&amp;#39;t start paying attention there, until 1968. Though I was around there in 1965.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Carlos went looking again, and ran into don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if don Juan had told him, &amp;quot;Yea, I know some Indian shamanism.  Originally it was Olmec, then they died off or migrated, and it went to the Toltecs.  But the Spanish destroyed their civilization, so the shamanism went to a Catholic Church official, a Chinese pirate, and some local Indians who were either crazy, or down on their luck.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos would have left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So instead don Juan told him it was from his own tribe, which worked out great because the freeway leading south from LA into Mexico is the bus route that ends at the site of the Yaqui wars in Mexico. Not only would Carlos easily believe it, but if don Juan took him down into Mexico, where they drove to would be consistent with the Yaqui story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt don Juan slapped his back and corrected the lie right away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it took Carlos years to remember what happened in heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which any good darkroom gazer can tell you, is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you get &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to remember anything later on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance,  Cholita decided to spend half a day at home.  She fled again somewhere around 4AM, but while I was doing darkroom, Cholita was home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point I was experimenting with the fastest way to store up energy from the puffs, and noticed a patch of intense purple and blue stuck to the inside of a cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My room had turned into a cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard Cholita banging the back door, and walking towards the bath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire room filled with dense purple, likely Cholita&amp;#39;s dark energy. She&amp;#39;s been pretending to be homeless in Beverly Hills, and seems to have picked up more dark energy than usual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily saw me wondering about the purple stuck on the inside of the cave, and explained dark energy in general to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She even showed me to reach up and &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; on it, to see that it attaches itself to things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was somehow related to how women store it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s all gone.  The entire explanation is impossible to recall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only thought about what I do remember, because of writing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is one benefit to posting your experiences.  Later you&amp;#39;ll look at it and think, &amp;quot;Oh yea, I did do that!!!

Florinda Donner-Grau (birth name Regine Thal)\n\n-2. Taisha Abelar (birth name Maryann Simko (Sirnko?))\n\n-3. Carol Tiggs (birth name Kathleen Pohlman (Pohlinan?))\n\n-4.

Even an unintentional lie about what they had for breakfast on a particular morning, would be enough in their eyes to discredit them.\n\nAnd they would certainly see the first three people on the list as \"accomplices.\"\n\nConversely, for them all it would take is one \"official\" mainstream spokesperson to declared it fiction, based on nothing but an opinion, and that one individual would be enough to confirm it for them.\n\nJust like Dan is the one official person that for many people in this subreddit is confirmation that it's all true. Combined with all the other subreddit member's experiences of course.\n\nThere's a scene in the Netflix series Stranger Things, season 2 episode 5,  that nicely portrays this dilemma with exposition, as well as the dilemma Castaneda faced when he was tasked with writing his books:\n\nhttps://subslikescript.com/series/Stranger_Things-4574334/season-2/episode-5-Chapter_Five_Dig_Dug\n\n\"There's nothing simple about it.\n\nNothing simple about\nanything you've told me.\n\nYou don't believe us, do you?\n\nI believe you, but\nthat's not the problem.\n\nYou don't need me to believe you.\nYou need them to believe you.\n\n- Them?\n- Them.\n\nWith a capital \"T.\"\n\nYour priest, your postman, your teacher,\n\nthe world at large.

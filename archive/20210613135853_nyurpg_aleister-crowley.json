With such systems, one learns how arbitrary are the reality maps\u00a0that can be coded into laryngeal grunts by hominids or visualized by a mammalian nervous system.  We can't even visualize the size of the local galaxy except in special high states.  Most people are trapped in one static reality map imprinted on their neurons when they were naive children, as Dr. Leary\u00a0keeps reminding us.  Alas, most so-called \"adepts\" or \"gurus\" are similarly trapped in the first post-rapture reality map imprinted after their initial Illumination, as Leary also realizes.  The point of systems like Tantra, Crowley, and Leary's Neurologic is to detach from all maps - which gives you the freedom to use any map where it works and drop it where it doesn't work.  As Dogen Zenji said, \"Time is three eyes and eight\u00a0elbows.\"\n\nWas Crowley a Satanist?  Well, he could and did play the Satanist game on occasion, just as he played the Buddhist game, the Taoist game, the Hindu game, the atheist game, and lots of others.  It is emphatically not true that his reputation as Satanist and Black Magician was spread entirely by his enemies;  he collaborated gleefully in blackening his own character.  To understand his motives, you must first understand the role of terror in reimprinting the nervous system for higher, post-terrestrial functioning.  Aside from yoga and psychedelic\u00a0drugs, the only method for reimprinting the nervous system is shock, especially near-death trauma.  Most shamans are people who have gone through the death-rebirth process, just as in our own society you still find people who have passed through \"clinical death,\" got revived on the operating table, and came back raving about transtime perspectives and beings of pure light.  Crowley knew, as many shamans do, that you can get this result (shock and reimprint) quickly with some students by simply scaring the daylights out of them.  A classic gimmick is to steadily increased their (repressed) suspicion that the beloved guru, in whom they have stupidly placed blind faith and love, is actually a diabolist out to destroy them, drive them made, or enslave them.  Crowley used this technique often.  The students who confront their fear and conquer it achieve a higher neurological awareness.\"\n\n*Robert Anton Wilson*\u00a0*- The* *Illuminati*\u00a0*Papers*\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n\"The American writer William Seabrook has a story of how Crowley demonstrated his magical powers *(seemingly derived from the unconscious hypnotic suggestion)* on Fifth Avenue. On a deserted stretch of pavement, Crowley fell into step behind a man and imitated his walk. Then, suddenly, Crowley buckled at the knees and squatted for a moment on his haunches; the man collapsed on to the pavement.

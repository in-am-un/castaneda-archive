They disappeared from  this  world because  they woke  up at  a  dreaming position beyond the  limits of  the  known. Your  dreaming position that  day was  in this  world, but  quite  a  distance  from  the city of  Oaxaca.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How  does  a  journey like  that  take  place?&amp;quot;  I  asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There  is  no way of  knowing how  it  is  done,&amp;quot;  he  said. &amp;quot;Strong emotion, or  unbending intent, or  great  interest  serves  as  a  guide;  then the  assemblage  point  gets  powerfully fixed at  the dreaming position, long enough to drag there  all  the  emanations  that  are  inside  the cocoon.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ekjow3", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ekjow3/more_advice_on_making_the_recapitulation_list/fdfrukw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1578368662.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1578368662.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fdsa2ei", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fdh528l", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "&gt;People Carlos taught became so obsessed with erasing personal history, that they erased their own chances to learn.\n\nOr, put another way, being so inaccessible to the self that you become inaccessible to the world at large (to *power*).

Your perception has to let go of what you were experiencing just before the shift, and then after the shift you can't possibly be perceiving that. It's gone.\n\nYour perception (awareness) has to pick something new to focus on, from wherever the assemblage point has moved.\n\nSo I was in the hotel, and had forgotten I went looking for Cholita.\n\nI knew it was a dream, but not enough to look at my hands.\n\nI got into an elevator to go to a higher floor.   Cholita loves Hotels, and tries to get a view if she can. Apparently her father, a pure blood Olmec Indian, was also an engineer who traveled, and first class.  He brought Cholita along to fabulous hotels when she was a child.\n\nSo to some extent, I **did** know I was hunting for Cholita.  I tried to head for higher ground.\n\nI just didn't remember enough to formalize it by making sure my body was fully formed, by looking at my hands.\n\nYou guys and gals out there:  **Always** find your hands.  If you don't, it leaves too much room for you to flatter yourself over ordinary dreams, causing you not to put in as much effort as you could.\n\nIt's like pretending you had dinner.  It's not going to pay off in the long run.\n\nAs I tried to push the elevator button to go up, someone forced their hands into the doors of the elevator, to keep them from closing.\n\nAnd then they just remained there, in the middle of the door.\n\nI realized, that's an inorganic being.\n\nAnd then I remembered to look at my hands.  I only had 4 fingers. There was no thumb.\n\nThe inorganic had held the doors open so I'd remain on that floor, and then it disappeared, leaving only a digital camera on the floor. \n\nAt the time I didn't think anything of that, but now I realize, what Cholita does in hotels, if she isn't staying there, is make pictures of the interesting features. Sometimes she'll do that for hours, while I have to dutifully follow her around to make sure she doesn't attack anyone.\n\nI walked out of the dream elevator and into a huge lobby.  Cholita loves huge lobbies with high ceilings.  It's 100% guaranteed that she's been spending some time in hotel lobbies since she fled.\n\nI had no trouble holding lucidity.  That used to be a big deal.\n\nApparently *dreaming awake* helps with normal lucid *dreaming*.\n\nI guess I'll go back and find out what's up with Gate #3.\n\nBut actually proving you were in your own bedroom, looking at your own body, is a causality violation.\n\nSo far I've seen one.  Telekinesis.\n\nBut I've never had proof of remote viewing.\n\nI guess, if you can pull that off, you get teleportation next.  You just dream of your bedroom for real, leave, go somewhere, and wake yourself up there.\n\nUnless I've forgotten how that one works.\n\nAnyone know if that's the procedure for teleportation?\n\nEdited five times", "edited": 1578351975.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fdeylfs", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recapitulation increases the frequency at which you find your hands.

It&amp;#39;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your perception (awareness) has to pick something new to focus on, from wherever the assemblage point has moved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was in the hotel, and had forgotten I went looking for Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew it was a dream, but not enough to look at my hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got into an elevator to go to a higher floor.   Cholita loves Hotels, and tries to get a view if she can. Apparently her father, a pure blood Olmec Indian, was also an engineer who traveled, and first class.  He brought Cholita along to fabulous hotels when she was a child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to some extent, I &lt;strong&gt;did&lt;/strong&gt; know I was hunting for Cholita.  I tried to head for higher ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just didn&amp;#39;t remember enough to formalize it by making sure my body was fully formed, by looking at my hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You guys and gals out there:  &lt;strong&gt;Always&lt;/strong&gt; find your hands.  If you don&amp;#39;t, it leaves too much room for you to flatter yourself over ordinary dreams, causing you not to put in as much effort as you could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like pretending you had dinner.  It&amp;#39;s not going to pay off in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I tried to push the elevator button to go up, someone forced their hands into the doors of the elevator, to keep them from closing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then they just remained there, in the middle of the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized, that&amp;#39;s an inorganic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I remembered to look at my hands.  I only had 4 fingers. There was no thumb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inorganic had held the doors open so I&amp;#39;d remain on that floor, and then it disappeared, leaving only a digital camera on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time I didn&amp;#39;t think anything of that, but now I realize, what Cholita does in hotels, if she isn&amp;#39;t staying there, is make pictures of the interesting features. Sometimes she&amp;#39;ll do that for hours, while I have to dutifully follow her around to make sure she doesn&amp;#39;t attack anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked out of the dream elevator and into a huge lobby.  Cholita loves huge lobbies with high ceilings.  It&amp;#39;s 100% guaranteed that she&amp;#39;s been spending some time in hotel lobbies since she fled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no trouble holding lucidity.  That used to be a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently &lt;em&gt;dreaming awake&lt;/em&gt; helps with normal lucid &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;ll go back and find out what&amp;#39;s up with Gate #3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But actually proving you were in your own bedroom, looking at your own body, is a causality violation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#39;ve seen one.  Telekinesis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;ve never had proof of remote viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess, if you can pull that off, you get teleportation next.  You just dream of your bedroom for real, leave, go somewhere, and wake yourself up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless I&amp;#39;ve forgotten how that one works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone know if that&amp;#39;s the procedure for teleportation?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited five times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_ekjow3", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ekjow3/more_advice_on_making_the_recapitulation_list/fdeylfs/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1578349360.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fdelv8q", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1578341775.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ekjow3", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Recapitulation can change you, from what I've heard, just as much as *dreaming*.

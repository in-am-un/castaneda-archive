So I don't forget them.\n\nEXTREMELY visible while doing tensegrity.  It seems as if you just have to notice it a bit better, to amplify the effect.\n\nAnd I suppose it's totally understandable that tensegrity would be designed to target different magical effects, since seers spent thousands of years discovering them.\n\nOne of the new types is \"Crusted Energy Manipulation\".\n\nLobster strike, moving dreaming energy from back to front, the initial move (now lost) to the mashing energy series, don Juan's weird catlike stretching.\n\nMy favorite is a bit of a creation of my own, but without actually modifying a form.\n\nIt can be done in many passes.\n\nYou just arch the back ,backwards, while pushing the chest out, arms down at a 45 for balance, and inhale deeply.\n\nSome crusted energy from  behind you comes off the walls, and you have a \"patchy puff haze\" flowing around.\n\nI suppose a bit like \"lazy gnats\".  \n\nLet's say in a forest filled with ferns and moss, you have bumble bees, flies, and gnats.\n\nThe bumble bees and flies are the puffs proper. Larger blobs of our energy body.\n\nIf you move your hand around in the ferns, they'll fly out.\n\nBut if you smooth your hand across the moss on the ground and rocks, you can \"uncrust\" some gnats, who lazily swarm around you in the air, waiting for things to settle back down.\n\nAt which point, they'll go back to munching on their moss.\n\nIn our luminous egg, that patchy awareness has hooked itself to the inside of the egg, and isn't coming off.\n\nThere may be a connection to recapitulation and how it \"retrieves tied up energy\" by going over memories from your entire life. Maybe that crusted energy is a tiny bit which is obsessed with particular strands of emanations?  So that it's stuck as far away from your physical body as it can go (the luminous shell inside).\n\nBut someone would have to be able to ***see*** a person recapitulating to tell if there's a connection.\n\nOr to see if it's easier to uncrust a patch before you do a thorough recap, then after.\n\nWe need more seers to find out details like that.\n\nBut the uncrusted energy forms a patchy pink/purple haze around you, not nearly as smooth as the second attention fog, but none of the bits and pieces are big enough to call a puff.\n\nAnd together they play a \"video in the air\".\n\nExcept it's surrounding you, and so you end up in another world.\n\nThe puffs can play movies inside themselves too, but it's self contained.\n\nWhen uncrusted energy does it, it surrounds you and seems to play a unified movie.\n\nOf another world.\n\nSo what happens is that ideally you stretch your back, inhale deeply and hold it, and a new world materializes around you.\n\nBut actually, that effect ought to work with anything that uncrusts energy.\n\nThose tensegrity moves for example.\n\nIn the case of moving dreaming energy from back to front, it's going to be more like a \"flow\" of uncrusted energy.\n\nAnd maybe not as patchy, since you didn't stretch or scrape it off.\n\nIn my case,  with the moving dreaming energy from back to front pass, the flow of pinkish light materializes the scene of someone inside a mirror, looking out.\n\nBut that's just because I've seen that clearly a few times.\n\nSomeone else would \"locate\" something different and get used to that result.\n\nSorcery works based on \"what was before, is easier to be now.\"\n\nIt's how reality itself works!  That's also what Silent Knowledge is.\n\nWhat was before, in the dark sea of awareness, \"replaying\" for you because you are totally silent and don't interfere with it.\n\nIn addition to \"crusted energy manipulation\", some magical passes also manipulate our connection between muscle memory, and our internal dialogue.\n\nBut at an abstract level.  The connection between the internal dialogue and the muscle memory is like the connection between an annoying Californian, and guy who speaks some very alien language, in a far away exotic country.\n\nI can't think of any offhand. \n\nZimbabwe???  Is that a real place?\n\nI just need one as a metaphor.\n\nThe annoying Californian is all judgmental and prudish like a Pilgrim who just landed at Plymouth rock, and headed straight for Salem to burn witches.\n\nAll morally superior feeling. \n\nIt's the \"ugly American syndrome\".  \n\nApplying his narrow brainwashed social  standards to foreign countries, sometimes completely ignoring what's actually going on there in favor of focusing on something else which makes him feel superior.\n\nOr like the EuroBuddhists who walked around private classes with their noses upturned, \"smelling shit\" everywhere as Carlos put it.\n\nYour internal dialogue can't fathom the flow of sentience coming from your muscle memory. \n\nBut you CAN notice the connection while doing tensegrity.\n\nAnd weaken it.  Re-train the muscles during specific Tensegrity movements, so that they no longer trigger the internal dialogue.\n\nNot to have opinions about how it should be or even what it means.  Teach your muscle memory and conscious mind not to ignore abstract aspects of physical movement,  which don't fit in with your eagerness to find fault in anything you don't understand.\n\nConcretely, you gaze down in the darkness while doing tensegrity at a specific leg movement.\n\nThe \"paisley\" pass from mashing energy for intent.   Where your right foot makes a large circle on the floor, counterclockwise, then it makes a smaller one inside that.\n\nBut there's also the stomping or heel touching movements, where you precisely tap the floor.\n\nIn Silent Knowledge you see ripples of blackness and dull golden light, emitted from the points of contact between the foot and the floor.\n\nAnd those trigger your internal dialogue.\n\nBy forcing silence to the extreme, you get to notice that.\n\nAnd break the connection.\n\nYou re-train the muscle memory to do movements silently.  In fact, you re-train it to \"notice\" that movements produce ripples in reality.\n\nWhich only makes sense. Once the internal dialogue is gone, reality is quite flexible.\n\nAll possibilities become possible again.\n\nHow many more tensegrity types there are I have no idea, but I'd guess and even expect that there are at least 8.\n\nThese 2 brings it up to 5.\n\nExcept that there are some very interesting tensegrity passes for quite specific things.\n\nAbsolutely ignored by our community.\n\nThere's La Gorda's sliding door pass, used to emergency exit a room right through the walls.\n\nAnd there's that \"wheel of time\" thing.  I'm not sure if that's the same as the tunnel with furrows, where you can gaze down each furrow to see another permutation of reality.\n\nAnd \"jump grooves\" to escape serious energy.\n\nThat was what Carlos was trying to do at the end, but he'd used up all of his energy trying to help us.\n\nSo he died.", "edited": 1709060701.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ksczv3g", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s two more &amp;quot;Tensegrity Types&amp;quot;.

Teach your muscle memory and conscious mind not to ignore abstract aspects of physical movement,  which don&amp;#39;t fit in with your eagerness to find fault in anything you don&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Concretely, you gaze down in the darkness while doing tensegrity at a specific leg movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;paisley&amp;quot; pass from mashing energy for intent.   Where your right foot makes a large circle on the floor, counterclockwise, then it makes a smaller one inside that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s also the stomping or heel touching movements, where you precisely tap the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Silent Knowledge you see ripples of blackness and dull golden light, emitted from the points of contact between the foot and the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And those trigger your internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By forcing silence to the extreme, you get to notice that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And break the connection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You re-train the muscle memory to do movements silently.  In fact, you re-train it to &amp;quot;notice&amp;quot; that movements produce ripples in reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which only makes sense. Once the internal dialogue is gone, reality is quite flexible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All possibilities become possible again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How many more tensegrity types there are I have no idea, but I&amp;#39;d guess and even expect that there are at least 8.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These 2 brings it up to 5.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that there are some very interesting tensegrity passes for quite specific things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely ignored by our community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s La Gorda&amp;#39;s sliding door pass, used to emergency exit a room right through the walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s that &amp;quot;wheel of time&amp;quot; thing.  I&amp;#39;m not sure if that&amp;#39;s the same as the tunnel with furrows, where you can gaze down each furrow to see another permutation of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;jump grooves&amp;quot; to escape serious energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was what Carlos was trying to do at the end, but he&amp;#39;d used up all of his energy trying to help us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he died.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1b0hqgo/tensegrity_types/ksczv3g/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1709033054.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1b0hqgo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ks84fru", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1708959790.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ks7ypko", "score": 10, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Stick around and read more posts.

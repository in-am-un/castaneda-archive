That's probably confusing to a beginner, but let's summarize it:\n\n**You** = your tonal body.  What you are used to.\n\n**Double** = the version of yourself used in dreams. What you \"sort of know\" about from being inside dreams each night.  Sorcerers learn to bring their dreaming self into the real world. So that they can \"be in 2 places at the same time\".\n\n**Inorganic being** = a creature with a real existence, but which does not have many emanations overlapping with us.  And his presence here is a projection from as far away as the center of the universe. But he can also live on the same planet, just undetectable to people stuck at this assemblage point position.\n\nBut when you are in a dream in your \"double\", what are all the other beings in that dream?  Assuming there are people around you in the dream.\n\nOne of them is possibly an **inorganic being**, who has taken over one of the \"phantoms\" in your dream. I've seen a single IOB pretend to be 5 phantoms.  You can learn to \"find the scout\" by burning up the dream phantoms, with an intense stare.  Staring at a single detail on the phantom is like trying to read a book in a dream.  The text keeps changing.  When you keep staring despite its mutations, it sets up a \"feedback loop\" and the phantom contorts, shrinks, and goes away.  Possibly you'll see a pile of old clothes on the ground, although they won't be the ones it was wearing.\n\nThe ones that dissolve with your stare were \"phantoms\".  If you stare at a \"scout\", meaning a phantom with an inorganic being inside, his body will begin to burn away, and you'll see the actual being as a bar of light.  I recommend stopping there, and letting it continue to hide in that form.\n\nYou can get it to follow you around in dreaming, so you don't lose lucidity.\n\nAnd if you are a beginner and have been in here a while, you're aware of \"phantom rooms\".\n\nSo why is it surprising, those phantom rooms can have people in them?\n\nI just never saw that before myself.\n\nBut the witches have told us, the phantoms in the death defier's phantom village have been there so long they actually have thoughts now.\n\nAnd the \"Pandora's Box\" pass is designed to scoop up a puff of light, which we know to be pieces of your energy body.\n\nAnd using your hands you \"inject\" it with ***intent***.  So it's designed for the very purpose of making phantoms.\n\nYou might remember it as the Rabbit with Japanese teeth, when don  Juan demonstrated \"creativity\" to Carlos in one of the books.\n\nAnd if you had already scooped up all of your puffs and deposited them on your energy pouches,  you might be surprised to see a single puff floating up to your eyes.  You thought you'd gotten all of those on your torso, to \"build the energy body\".\n\nAnd yet here's a stray puff, wanting to \"play\".\n\nIt's a \"Rebel Puff\"!\n\nYou can form it into a \"being\".\n\nI like to say it's a \"phantom assistant\", because it will stick around and assist you.\n\nAnd that's a much nicer name than, \"Super Scary Zombie Woman\".\n\nIt's not human, not an inorganic being, and yet there it is.  So it must be a phantom!\n\nExcept, it has the awareness from your double inside of it.\n\nCarlos didn't go into that as far as I know. But when you do it and you've got goosebumps all over looking at the cloaked zombie standing in front of you, you have to accept that this is a sorcery  technique.\n\nOne Cholita already showed me long ago.\n\nAnd let me warn you. If you make one of these and release it into the room, then ignore it, you might find it gets tired of being ignored, and makes its continued presence known!\n\nSo what are they good for?\n\nSince it's part of your double, and your double wanders around infinity endlessly, visiting even worlds so abstract your tonal would have a hard time even comprehending them, this phantom assistant can enter anything.\n\nAnywhere your tonal can see, this assistant can go.\n\nThere's a surprising side effect of that.  They can pull on your awareness.\n\nSo for instance, if you materialize one standing near you which then turns around and walks toward the phantom room you have created (in the orange zone), the \"walls\" turn out to be further away than you realized. And the phantom goes over to the further away wall, now inside the phantom room by at least 3 feet, and can even adjust a picture hanging on the wall.\n\nA picture which of course \"is not really there\".\n\nAs you watch that, incredulous, you get \"sucked over there\" yourself.  You're now fully inside the phantom room, which is more like a dream than it was before.\n\nIt's not \"over there\" on the wall.\n\nYou're in that dream.\n\nSo would you like to go directly into dreaming, from awake?\n\nMeaning, not this darkroom nonsense, where the dreams float around.  And yet you know \"those are over there, but I'm over here\".\n\nIf you'd like to just flat walk into the dreaming world, and leave this one, there's a method.  A technique you could use.\n\nKeep in mind, that phantom can go ANYWHERE you can see, even if you cannot.\n\nSo if you use \"The Wrestler\" pass to form a phantom tunnel to connect you to a \"target\" 1000 miles away, and you can see on the other side of the phantom tunnel, you can send your phantom assistant to the other side.\n\nFor what, I have no idea.\n\nIf I were Cholita, I might send the phantom assistant to kick someone's ass, for being annoying.\n\nBut otherwise, I can't really see asking your phantom assistant to go talk to the people on the other side of a phantom tunnel 1000 miles away, and invite them to come visit you by going the opposite direction in the tunnel.  Telling them, \"Don't worry, it's safe.\"\n\nWhen you have no idea if it's \"safe\".\n\nStill, it's very fun to watch,  even if it makes no sense.\n\nWhen I selected the flair for this post, I remembered a comment my IOB \"Mystery\" made about it.\n\nI've been giving Mystery more energy lately, to make sure I don't lose her. She was a gift from Cholita.\n\nTwice now, Mystery has shown me her \"friend\".  She comes in a pair also.  But when Cholita stuck her in my room and left, Mystery was 4 or 5 people.\n\nThere's a post in here somewhere showing whether it was 4 or 5. I can't recall.\n\nWhen Mystery saw me doing this phantom being trick she said, \"I love games too!\"\n\nMy reaction was, \"Game?  Is this just a game???\"\n\nSo I picked the \"darkroom games\" flair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Phantom Assistants", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Games"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"qa1v3s7ypbu81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qa1v3s7ypbu81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb0a2fc542c3fab6afe7953f0d2def3eb4a7ccac"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qa1v3s7ypbu81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bd89d41aabe921bbfe37376bcc2eeb547bab43e"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qa1v3s7ypbu81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b368b852d4302a43323ff8aa53e1719c11278542"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qa1v3s7ypbu81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=940c2dc8418e871bbf563f7056d6f86d3b9388ac"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qa1v3s7ypbu81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ea9205b7d01749131bc7b6db32facc5254bb7f8"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qa1v3s7ypbu81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8719d0fd70225840d95989a201143f0cee05c1a7"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qa1v3s7ypbu81.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c2ff9b3f4bacf86bc259bfa006e4c73392f35d8"}, "id": "qa1v3s7ypbu81"}}, "name": "t3_u6ktx2", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 23, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Games", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 23, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7sQiSuxwSMb5RNZ9vW0a1to0d37Pi0uA3pQkaJjnl-E.jpg", "edited": 1650313095.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1650308824.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qa1v3s7ypbu81.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4c2ff9b3f4bacf86bc259bfa006e4c73392f35d8\"&gt;Turns out, you can make your own scary being!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This probably should have been obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can make a &amp;quot;phantom&amp;quot; into your &amp;quot;assistant&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The surprising part is how stable they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A phantom being is one that doesn&amp;#39;t actually have a real existence.

It lasted a good 10 seconds, with wave after wave of intense fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Afraid of fear?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the best tool we have!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go find yourself an old fashioned drill sergeant.  The ones who run boot camps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Preferably a marine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get him to shout in your face for 10 minutes and kick you in the butt as he pushes you around all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pay him cash to frighten you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or go to the worst area of town, and pay the most scary man you can find, to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to the amusement park, and take all the most scary rides you can find.  Especially ones that drop suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learn sky diving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Problem solved I suspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just need a petty tyrant who oppresses with violence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or to learn to like fear by some other method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;#39;t different types of fear. Dread isn&amp;#39;t fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fear is something to do with the assemblage point.  A horizontal shift crisis perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can conquer darkroom fear by conquering any other sort of fear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get a black T shirt that says, &amp;quot;Fear Master&amp;quot;.  When people ask, pull our our cellphone and show them pics of you doing frightening things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null,

He told us to take off our clothes, and lie in the path of ants.\n\nArgentinian, the micro-ants you see, are pretty safe.  Fire ants, probably not a good idea.\n\nSo you feel it as a tingle.  Best way is the outside part of your right hand, and a little ways down the wrist.  Same area used in a rising block in Karate.\n\nSlowly wave that part around in the area in front of navel, and to the right, and below it.  Also down by the right ankle.\n\nIf you can feel one, you can move your assemblage point with it, if you can get silent.\n\nYou can \"cheat\" by putting a fan in your pitch black darkened room, force silence, look at colors, then wave the right arm around slowly, looking for cobwebs.\n\nOf course, with the fan, some you feel will just be the little hairs on that sensitive portion of your right hand and forearm.  But it'll teach you how to find them and eventually you won't be able to tell the difference between a micro-air current induced one, and one that's \"just there\".\n\nYou can also move another person's assemblage point by feeling a cob web around near their waist, and tracing it all the way up to the left shoulder.\n\nBut watch out!  All hell can break loose.  If theirs moves, it'll tug yours along too.\n\nI've moved Cholita's assemblage point several times that way.  Her luminous body becomes visible, even in daylight, and the result of witnessing a thing like that gives the sensation you are about to float up and away.\n\nJust don't panic.  How cool would it be if you actually did float?  So why worry?\n\nExcept that Cholita figured it out, and won't allow me to stand where needed anymore.\n\nYou can't put anything over on Cholita for very long.\n\nSometimes you'll get silent, and find a cobweb on the right side around stomach level, on a line going to the ankle. You can even \"tug\" on it, and get a sensation in the right foot.  It says here \"calf\", but my experience puts it a bit lower, nearer to the ankle and often the sensation is on the foot itself, right side.\n\nIt's also possible to learn to feel these cobwebs while doing tensegrity.\n\nMoving the assemblage point by feeling cobwebs is much faster than colors, but the result is slightly different.  Meaning, since it's different, you'll tend to blank out.\n\nI guess we need a little experience in all positions of the assemblage point, before we're blank out proofed.\n\nI now count 5 good ways to move the assemblage point towards heightened awareness.\n\nThat's what's been missing from Tensegrity, allowing so many people to stagnate for years and years.\n\nHeightened Awareness.  Without it, there's no magic.  Maybe eventually, the Facilitators can learn how to move entire groups into heightened awareness, with tensegrity.\n\nBut it would take some kind of \"touchy feeling\" mental approach, similar to trying to feel for cobwebs.  I'm not sure what it might look like, but it was clearly what Carlos was trying to do at workshops, when he spoke about how much \"energetic mass\" he now had available to him.\n\nWe'd need full-on daylight *seers* to design that.\n\nI might not be around by then, but I suggest finding the actual \"cobweb feelers\" in a group, station them next to people (as pairs), and let them move the assemblage points of half the participants.\n\nAssuming the other half learns to feel cobwebs.\n\nIt would be more effective than Carol's suggestion everyone can push on each other's left shoulders.  And that's because it would take someone who can actually feel those energy strands.\n\nWith the shoulder method, there's too much room for self-pity induced pretending.\n\nAll of these following methods  to move towards heightened awareness require silence.\n\nIf you can't manage that, gazing is a viable alternative.  Especially for women.\n\nBut with silence you can move it by:\n\n1): Scooping colors in darkness, and doing Tensegrity to witness how it also pushes the colors around.\n\n2): Scooping blackness in darkness.  Same basic principle as scooping colors, however it might take more experience to manipulate blackness, than it does to manipulate colors. And it's possible you have to have \"second attention fog\" or you can't see the blackness.\n\n3): Feeling for cobwebs.  If you're visiting the Forbidden City in Beijing, don't forget to feel around at the main subway exit going to the Palace.  Tens of thousands of people walk by there hourly, and they deposit cobwebs as they walk. There's literally a pond of tingly feelings on the concrete walkway there.  On the public underpass, coming up to the main sidewalk.\n\nThere's a Tensegrity move to scoop some of that up, and pour it over your head.\n\nCarlos also alerted us to that highly trafficked area cobweb effect.  I wish I could recall more details, but it was basically something like, we look a little like pig pen, the Peanuts cartoon character. As we walk around, little hairs fall to the ground.  If you have a huge traffic of pig pens walking by somewhere, it leaves thick dust all over the ground.\n\nI have a vague memory that one of  the Witches was a \"cobweb  hunter\".  Or at least, as Carlos was explaining about them, he kept looking her direction for agreement.\n\n\"Mashing energy\" makes it visible in darkness. If you want to *see* Tensegrity, that's the first move that will likely work for you.  Don't feel embarrassed if it's too vague.\n\nLater, it won't be!  When it's anything but vague, you'll get an urge to run for your life!\n\nYou can also go \"cobweb hunting\" at night, at places with large expanses and no blockages. Like a beach at night.  Find a cobweb, follow it.\n\nYou might find a person on the other end!\n\n4): Listening for second attention sounds.\n\n5): Watching an IOB or a manifestation of the second attention in visible form.\n\n\\#5 requires those actually be present, but it doesn't always require that you were silent a long time and learned to perceive them.  Apparently walking in a forest at night can produce one of those two.\n\nEdited eight times", "edited": 1589302284.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fqdx8ii", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can literally feel the connection to the calves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the cobweb feeling Carlos taught us about.

He was like an impeccable stand-up comedian, never showing up without a good story and several jokes.  Each story was designed around a teaching theme. He once told us that it takes telling a story 3 times before everyone gets it.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that too, but it\u2019s mighty convenient to be able to tell the same story 3 times when you have multiple audiences and forget where you\u2019ve told it.\n\nSomewhere towards the end of his life he seemed to be trying to push our learning into the realm of concrete experiences. He introduced us to a silence technique using a stick with a pad on the top.  If you\u2019ve practiced meditation or silence in a chair, you\u2019ll be familiar with the problem of your head falling forward and resting on your chest.  You can get into a state of complete awareness, while completely asleep.  It\u2019s precious, but very difficult to hold your head up when asleep, and it hurts to rest your chin on your chest.\n\nYou can prevent this problem by using a small wooden pole, about 2-3 feet long, 1-inch in diameter, with a pad on one end. You rest your forehead on it, about where the \u201cthird eye\u201d is said to be, while you lean forward sitting cross legged on the floor.  Your feet stabilize the stick bottom at an angle comfortable for your head. Then you force silence for as long as you can, trying to reach the tipping point.  He actually had us do it in a group, once we\u2019d made our poles.  The goal in class was to \u201csee\u201d.\n\nHe also introduced us to one of his allies.  He tried to point out how it darted across the room from the water cooler on one side, to the far end where students were standing.  He said that the water in the cooler attracted the allies.\n\nHe was particularly interested in personal experiences during this period, openly asking for them.  Usually there was a fear of speaking up.  There\u2019s a story about a woman who was on the fast track to be in the inner circle.  One of the other women bought her some shoes as a gift.  When she saw them she said, \u201cI can\u2019t wear those!!!\u201d.   She was immediately ex-communicated.\n\nAnd so, while it was known to be dangerous to stand out, Carlos actually urged us to speak up at that time.   To complicate things, there was some slight descent in the class.  I\u2019d guess it was mostly because people knew he was dying.   But also, people interested in Castaneda\u2019s writings have often found something else in the meantime, and still cling to a preference for the thing they\u2019d put more time into.  It was as if some didn\u2019t believe the whole thing, but were willing to be entertained.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCarlos still had some hope for sticking around longer. He was trying to gather enough energetic mass to \u201cjump grooves\u201d.  He explained this with several stories about a tunnel with furrows, which sorcerers have access to.  A sorcerer can look down one of the furrows inside the tunnel, and see another world.  If Carlos could jump grooves by switching to another of these, he could repair his body.  But so far, he hadn\u2019t had the energy for it.\n\nI don\u2019t know how many days of classes took place with this new push for direct experiences, but at one point we were anticipating something.  The rumor was that one of the witches would come to give us a demonstration.  By that time, it was somewhat rare for one of the witches to show up. When they did it always felt like a special occasion.\n\nWhen the event came, it was Carol Tiggs who was to \u201cgive\u201d the demonstration.  I say \u201cgive\u201d, because I\u2019m not completely convinced Carol knew what was going to happen.  Carlos was clearly in charge of it. He stood at the front of the room, near the stairs.  Everyone else was opposite him, in poorly formed rows of people, as you would find when practicing tensegrity.\n\nCarol walked in from his right side, and Carlos announced she was going to select 2 people.  She made her picks, and I was lucky enough to be one of them.\n\nShe had the first person sit down on the floor with their legs stretched out, she put her hands behind their head, and leaned the person backwards onto the floor.  I heard someone whisper, \u201cThat\u2019s what stage magicians do!\u201d as a sort of criticism.   Carlos just remained at the front of the class, watching with a big smile on his face.\n\nCarol on the other hand looked a little like she was just hoping for the best.  She came to me, and did the same thing.  But instead of ending up laying on my back on the floor, I fell into a hole deep in the ground, with no one else around.\n\nI was confused, and tried to figure out where I was. I only vaguely remembered that I was in the middle of a \u201cdemonstration\u201d.  I was in a very long tunnel, still sitting on my butt with my legs stretched out. It was as if Carol had never leaned me back at all.  The tunnel was dug in light brown dirt.   But it was so perfectly round, it could only have been cut by a machine.   I tried to see the end of it, but it went so far that it was impossible to see anything but darkness.\n\nI was just trying to figure out why there was so much light in my part of the tunnel, when I realized it was the light in the real room.  I was sitting up, a little disoriented.  Someone asked what happened and all I could say was \u201cbrown hole\u2026  I saw a brown hole.\u201d\n\nLooking back, I wish I\u2019d said something like, \u201cDarn Carol, that was amazing!!!\u201d  But in spite of the experience it seemed like it was a dream.  I felt that maybe I\u2019d caused it myself, by forcing silence. I didn\u2019t know what Carol was trying to demonstrate, and didn\u2019t want to spoil the demo by saying the wrong thing.\n\nCarlos\u2019 attempts to demonstrate magic to his class before he died didn\u2019t seem to go well.  I wondered about the brown tunnel for a long time after he died.  I ran into a curious mention in a book from the 1600s, of a sorcerer in Ireland who fell into a tunnel and was taken by the fairies.   He was found dead. This sorcerer was a leader of the church and somehow got a message out saying not to bury him, and that on a certain day he\u2019d rise up in his dead body.  If someone could quickly toss a blanket over him, he\u2019d be restored to the real world.\n\nBut when the event actually happened, everyone around him was so stunned that they forgot about the blanket.   And the fairies kept him in their world.\n\nCarlos had been worried about the same thing towards the end of his life.  He said that the allies will find any weakness and keep pulling on it. He made a gesture that seemed like someone pulling on a thread on a sweater, unraveling it as they pulled up.   He explained that they had him nightly hopping from one stone to the other, in a world I can only presume had a great deal of water.  He was like a puppet on a string, and didn\u2019t have the energy to stop them.\n\nBut 17 years after his death I\u2019d largely forgotten about all that, and certainly about the brown tunnel.   Then one day I was in Thailand, walking under the Bangkok Skytrain.  My company had supplied security cameras for that area.   The Thai landscape was so alien looking to me that I decided to walk under the train route while forcing silence.\n\nOne interesting thing about international travel is that you end up leaving ordinary worries behind. You can\u2019t water the lawn, you can\u2019t pay the bills, you don\u2019t have think about the social obligations you have at home.  It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019ve recapitulated all of that, and it no longer has an influence on you.  As a result, you find yourself disentangled from more of the things that can keep your assemblage point in place.\n\nWalking in silence in that strange scenery payed off.  After a few hours I noticed that I\u2019d fallen into \u201cheightened awareness\u201d. And it was stable. In fact, it lasted 2 weeks before the sweltering heat of Southeast Asia got the best of me.  And during that entire time, if I wanted a reminder that I was still in heightened awareness, I only had to close my eyes.  There was \u201cthe wall\u201d, something Carlos had taught us as a beginner\u2019s technique for seeing.\n\nExcept that instead of being made out of vague colors of light, this wall was covered in burlap. It looked like impromptu wallpaper from the 70s, belonging in a cheesy nautical themed man-cave.\n\nI experimented and found that it was the same as seeing the wall under ordinary circumstances.  One odd thing, the details of the burlap fabric seemed to be consistent.  If I found a detail like a thicker strand in the fabric, opened my eyes and closed them again, the detail was still in the same place.\n\nThings could appear on it as normally happens with \u201cthe wall\u201d, but if I wanted to \u201csee\u201d something specific I only had to look through it.  To that end, I was sitting on a bench in the 95F, 99% humidity heat, watching an orange cat chase a fat rat at very low speed. Both seemed so overcome by the heat that they could only act out the death struggle in slow motion.  The rat made it to the sewer entry before the cat could waddle fast enough to grab it.  Then the cat surprised me, by jumping up to the next floor of an apartment complex, and to the next, and the next, until it was high on the top across the alley. Each level took only one leap.\n\nI closed my eyes to see the cat, peered through the wall, but instead of seeing energy in the cat, I found myself in the brown tunnel again.  This time I was standing up, leaning on the side with one hand.  A presence of some type was just behind me, explaining things.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s over that way\u201d, it explained.  I understood this to be a reference to the Irish sorcerer.  \u201cThis one here is a pirate.\u201d  I looked at the wall where he was indicating, and saw the life of a sorcerer from China who had traveled to Mexico.  I was so puzzled by the view that I didn\u2019t pay attention to the details.  Next to that view was another, and I understood it was the sorcerer before that.  There was a long line of them going far into the tunnel.\n\nI fancied it to be Carlos\u2019 tunnel with furrows, where you could look down a furrow and view an entire world.  But I hadn\u2019t conceived of looking into paintings.   I wondered if it was the very same brown tunnel shown to me by Carol Tiggs, when she did her \u201cStage Magician\u201d demonstration.   But there was no way to know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Stage Magician", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_an7jub", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 9, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1549329768.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1549321317.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In private classes Carlos would repeat a story as many as 3 times.

However, in accordance with the Rule of the three-pronged nagual, I am following a long-term strategy devised by Don Juan, which commits you to my teacher&amp;#39;s intent.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is expected from you is that you say to those who surround you: &amp;#39;You are free, you can fly by yourselves! You have the necessary information, what are you waiting for? Act impeccably, and see how energy finds a way.&amp;#39;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Warn everyone that with the culmination of Don Juan&amp;#39;s lineage, the knowledge is wide open. Each warrior is responsible for himself, and can provide himself with the minimum opportunity, which is to organize his own party.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_an7jub", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/an7jub/the_stage_magician/eg1pzwi/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1549662076.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "efy1ysn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dreamerandstalker", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1549550676.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_an7jub", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_1cnpj1y6", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "author_cakeday": true, "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_efy1ysn", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My view on the subject is this or to say my understanding is this...\nI have only read his books and re read them over a couple decades. \nI am far from being a warrior, I have no super power but I am semi aware of intention, \nI practice stalking and enjoy the odd lucid dreams.\nRecently I climbed through a mirror while dreaming that was very cool.\nI actually taught the teachings of Carlos to a group of spirituality minded people for several years, as far as I could manage.\nI continue to allow spirit to align me with individuals who I causally guide on the path of heart, at spirits request.\nI take great pleasure in these moments.\nMaybe one or two of these people will find freedom?\nSo my take on it has always been the Carlos set the stage on spirits request so that the knowledge would spread and eventually take seed every now and then, here or there.\nThe teachings of Don Juan intended for Carlos to find freedom but it was ultimately up to Carlos, spirit didn\u2019t require Carlos to do anything else.\nThe teachings of Carlos upon the World is like Pandora\u2019s box, it is now open and is still spreading.\nPerhaps in a hundred/ thousand years the world may be completely different because of individuals looking past and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/an7jub/the_stage_magician/efy1ysn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1549550676.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_an7jub", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iwflbqv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1668495639.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iwekpse", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That's what we've been taught.\n\nBut I suspect, none of us could get that lucky.\n\nWe have to do this on our own power.

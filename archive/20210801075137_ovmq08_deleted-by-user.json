But the very term &amp;#39;astral protection&amp;#39; itself ensures that the adherent is limiting what they believe they can do in their double, right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It comes with too many unspoken/unconscious cognitive agreements, and has it&amp;#39;s own intent, separate from the sorcerer&amp;#39;s intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s inextricably tied to self-reflection, which is the very thing we have to drop if we want to have high level success at sorcery. That&amp;#39;s why the term itself can be so harmful to your chances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s simple to avoid.

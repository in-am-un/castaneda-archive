So that when you try to see the emanations, you're more likely to see combinations of them, forming a new \"thing\".\n\nYou end up looking at the \"thing\", not the actual emanations.  The thing could be just texture, lines, or even a muddy pile of white worm like things.\n\nYou could almost say that intent weaves them together for us by default,  until ultimately we end up with a real world right in front of our face.\n\nOne thing you might want to do with the whitish light is use it like the Shadow Beings at Zuleica's tree house.\n\nTaisha did something which shifted her assemblage point to a favorable position, and Zuleica wanted her to hold it there.\n\nProbably so that later on they could bring out the double.\n\nSo she had Taisha climb up there to be amidst the shadow beings who liked that tree.\n\nThose tree spirits don't much care for people, but we can still perceive them.\n\nSo they're like a \"permanent puff\" in the darkroom.\n\nWe use silence plus the puffs, to pull our assemblage points towards heightened awareness.\n\nBut actually they tug on the assemblage point towards seeing them better.  The silence is only needed so that it can move.\n\nAnything coming from the second attention tugs on the assemblage point.\n\nSo that you can perceive that thing more clearly. If it didn't, we'd be out of luck on everything!  Nothing would form, not even our first attention.\n\nA tug from the second attention can mean a change in depth along the J curve, but it can also mean a horizontal shift.\n\nIn general, if you gaze at it, it pulls down.\n\nIf you pretend the thing is real and start to play with it as real, it tugs horizontally.\n\nTensegrity does a little of both, but it's preplanned not to go horizontally too much, as long as you stick to the technique.\n\nCarlos of course would have been able to feel the results as he did the technique, and adjust things to make sure it was an overall positive movement of the assemblage point.\n\nAnd it brings out the puffs of color, which help to trap our attention.\n\nBut the whitish light is unique.  It's not just a single bundle of emanations you can play with.\n\nIt's all of them.  Right in your face.\n\nAnd they're creating your entire reality.\n\nIf you stir them, you can select a new reality.\n\nFor that reason, the whitish light is even better for holding your assemblage point in HA, than either a puff, or a Shadow Being.\n\nSo what's this use I'm suggesting?\n\nYou have to play with it so much that when you wake up the next day, you can still see it behind your closed eyes.\n\nYou look, see the familiar \"texture\" of the whitish light, and you can feel that you can gaze **through** it.\n\nIt's \"the wall\". Or if you like, your \"second attention\" is active.  While you are awake!\n\nAs long as you can see the wall when you close your eyes, you will remain in HA.\n\nAnd you can use it to do magic. To *see*.\n\nI suspect you can't teach someone to learn to use it this way, as an actual technique.  Teach them to go directly for that, and skip the rest.  \n\nIt just isn't possible.  They have to see all the places along the way.\n\nFor example, if you do puffery until you get to the whitish light  there isn't some further exercise we could do, to make it stick around all the next day.\n\nSo about all you can do with this knowledge, is look for the whitish light.\n\nNotice it when it happens outside the dark room.\n\nIt's an opportunity to do what Taisha did up in the tree house.\n\nStalking that position of the assemblage point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "One thing you can do

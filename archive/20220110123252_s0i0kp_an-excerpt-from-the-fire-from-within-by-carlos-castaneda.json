He said that seers saw that from the moment of conception awareness is enhanced, enriched, by the process of being alive. He said that seers saw, for instance, that the awareness of an individual insect or that of an individual man grows from the moment of conception in astoundingly different ways, but with equal consistency.\n\n\u201cIs it from the moment of conception or from the moment of birth that awareness develops?\u201d I asked. \n\n   \u201cAwareness develops from the moment of conception,\u201d he replied. \u201cI have always told you that sexual energy is something of ultimate importance and that it has to be controlled and used with great care. But you have always resented what I said, because you thought I was speaking of control in terms of morality; I always meant it in terms of saving and rechanneling energy.\u201d\n\nDon Juan looked at Genaro. Genaro nodded his head in approval. \n\n   \u201cGenaro is going to tell you what our benefactor, the nagual Julian, used to say about saving and rechanneling sexual energy,\u201d don Juan said to me.\n\n   \u201cThe nagual Julian used to say that to have sex is a matter of energy,\u201d Genaro began. \u201cFor instance, he never had any problems having sex, because he had bushels of energy. But he took one look at me and prescribed right away that  my peter was just for peeing. He told me that I didn\u2019t have enough energy to have sex. He said that my parents were too bored and too tired when they made me; he said that I was the result of very boring sex, cojida aburrida. I was born like that, bored and tired. The nagual Julian recommended that people like me should never have sex; this way we can store the little energy we have.\n\n\u201cHe said the same thing to Silvio Manuel and to Emilito. He saw that the others had enough energy. They were not the result of bored sex. He told them that they could do anything they wanted with their sexual energy, but he recommended that they control themselves and understand the Eagle\u2019s command that sex is for bestowing the glow of awareness. We all said we had understood.\n\n   \u201cOne day, without any warning at all, he opened the curtain of the other world with the help of his own benefactor, the nagual Ellas, and pushed all of us inside, with no hesitation whatsoever. All of us, except Silvio Manuel, nearly died in there. We had no energy to withstand the impact of the other world. None of us, except Silvio Manuel, had followed the nagual\u2019s recommendation.\u201d \n\n   \u201cWhat is the curtain of the other world?\u201d I asked don Juan.\n\n\u201cWhat Genaro said?it is a curtain,\u201d don Juan replied. \u201cBut you\u2019re getting off the subject. You always do. We\u2019re talking about the Eagle\u2019s command about sex. It is the Eagle\u2019s command that sexual energy be used for creating life. Through sexual energy, the eagle bestows awareness. So when sentient beings are engaged in sexual intercourse, the emanations inside their cocoons do their best to bestow awareness to the new sentient being they are creating.\u201d\n\n   He said that during the sexual act, the emanations encased inside the cocoon of both partners undergo a profound agitation, the culminating point of which is a merging, a fusing of two pieces of the glow of awareness, one from each partner, that separate from their cocoons.\n\n\u201cSexual intercourse is always a bestowal of awareness even though the bestowal may not be consolidated,\u201d he went on. \u201cThe emanations inside the cocoon of human beings don\u2019t know of intercourse for fun.\u201d \n\n   Genaro leaned over toward me from his chair across the table and talked to me in a low voice, shaking his head for emphasis. \n\n   \u201cThe nagual is telling you the truth,\u201d he said and winked at me. \u201cThose emanations really don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n   Don Juan fought not to laugh and added that the fallacy of man is to act with total disregard for the mystery of existence and to believe that such a sublime act of bestowing life and awareness is merely a physical drive that one can twist at will. \n\n   Genaro made obscene sexual gestures, twisting his pelvis around, on and on. Don Juan nodded and said that that was exactly what he meant. Genaro thanked him for acknowledging his one and only contribution to the explanation of awareness. \n\n   Both of them laughed like idiots, saying that if I had known how serious their benefactor was about the explanation of awareness, I would be laughing with them. \n\n   I earnestly asked don Juan what all this meant for an average man in the daytoday world. \u201cYou mean what Genaro is doing?\u201d he asked me in mock seriousness.\n\n   Their glee was always contagious. It took a long time for them to calm down. Their level of energy was so high that next to them, I seemed old and decrepit. \n\n   \u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d don Juan finally answered me. \u201cAll I know is what it means to be warriors. They know that the only real energy we possess is a life bestowing sexual energy. This knowledge makes them permanently conscious of their responsibility. \n\n   \u201cIf warriors want to have enough energy to see, they must become misers with their sexual energy. That was the lesson the nagual Julian gave us. He pushed us into the unknown, and we all nearly died. Since everyone of us wanted to see, we, of course, abstained from wasting our glow of awareness.\u201d \n\n   I had heard him voice that belief before. Every time he did, we got into an argument. I always felt compelled to protest and raise objections to what I thought was a puritanical attitude toward sex.\n\n   I again raised my objections. Both of them laughed to tears. \n\n   \u201cWhat can be done with man\u2019s natural sensuality?\u201d I asked don Juan.\n\n   \u201cNothing,\u201d he replied. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with man\u2019s sensuality, it\u2019s man\u2019s ignorance of and disregard for his magical nature that is wrong. It\u2019s a mistake to waste recklessly the life bestowing force of sex and not have children, but it\u2019s also a mistake not to know that in having children one taxes the glow of awareness.\u201d \n\n   \u201cHow do seers know that having children taxes the glow of awareness?\u201d I asked.\n\n   \u201cThey see that on having a child, the parents\u2019 glow of awareness diminishes and the child\u2019s increases. In some supersensitive, frail parents, the glow of awareness almost disappears. As children enhance their awareness, a big dark spot develops in the luminous cocoon of the parents, on the very place from which the glow was taken away. It is usually on the midsection of the cocoon. Sometimes those spots can even be seen superimposed on the body itself.\u201d\n\nI asked him if there was anything that could be done to give people a more balanced understanding of the glow of awareness. \n\n   \u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least, there is nothing that seers can do. Seers aim to be free, to be unbiased witnesses incapable of passing judgment; otherwise they would have to assume the responsibility for bringing about a more adjusted cycle. No one can do that. The new cycle, if it is to come, must come of itself.\u201d\\]", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "An excerpt from \"The Fire From Within\" By: Carlos Castaneda", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pureretention", "hidden": false, "pwls": null, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_rzui5t", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1641743417.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": null, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "domain": "self.pureretention", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[After a long interruption, don Juan continued explaining.

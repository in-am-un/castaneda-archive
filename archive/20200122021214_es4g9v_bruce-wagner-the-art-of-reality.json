To me, such critics are from a long lineage of teachers themselves, and I say this without irony. Even a novelist like me needs to be reminded that all is fiction. I should have said: even a novelist like me needs to be reminded that even fiction isn\u2019t real. It\u2019s a tonic to be reminded of the folly and \u201cincoherence of philosophers\u201d\n\n&gt; ...\n\n&gt;It is good to be reminded that all is Fable, be it emanations of scholar, artist, academician, or Eagle; even this epic artful dream\u2014especially this\u2014of man\u2019s shared perception. It is good to know that amid this grand and grandiose fiction, the paths of the heart are indeed lonely hunters, and good too to be gently reminded of the axiom that no one gets out alive. Because in a dualistic cosmos, it agreeably follows that no one gets out dead either.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis concept is expounded upon in the essay [Alan Moore\u2019s Promethea: Countercultural Gnosis and the End of the World](https://www.academia.edu/28890953/Alan_Moores_Promethea_Countercultural_Gnosis_and_the_End_of_the_World_2016_)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**Fiction as Reality**\n\n&gt;First and foremost, Promethea is an exuberant celebration of the creative imagination. The narrative is based consistently on one single Master Thesis: \n\n&gt;There is no difference between fiction and reality. \n\n&gt;This central focus makes Alan Moore\u2019s work extremely relevant to a currently emerging subfield in the study of contemporary religion and esotericism that is sometimes referred to as \u201c\udbc0\udc66fiction-based religions,\u201d\udbc0\udc32\udbc0\udc31 sometimes as \u201chyper-real religions,\u201d\udbc0\udc32\udbc0\udc32 and sometimes as \u201cinvented religions.\u201d\udbc0\udc32\udbc0\udc33 The terminology is still very much in a state of flux, but scholars seem to agree that in much of contemporary popular culture (whether online or offine), the question of whether gods, demons, angels, or other spiritual entities or realities are \u201creal\u201d or \u201cimaginary\u201d is becoming ever less relevant to practitioners. As a result, the distinction between \u201cbelief\u201d and \u201cnon-belief\u201d is becoming a non-issue for them as well.

From such a perspective, theoretical and intellectual questions such as \u201cin what exact sense\u201d can these entities be considered to be real, or what theoretical concept of \u201creality\u201d is entailed in calling them real, seem a somewhat stuffy legacy of Protestant obsessions quite alien to most practitioners. They are usually happy to leave such questions for philosophers to figure out.\n\n333", "edited": 1579662267.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ff7zfkq", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excellent read, this one passage in particular caught me...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am always interested in those who in rebuke, agitation, or enmity assert Carlos Castaneda\u2019s writings to be fiction. To me, such critics are from a long lineage of teachers themselves, and I say this without irony. Even a novelist like me needs to be reminded that all is fiction. I should have said: even a novelist like me needs to be reminded that even fiction isn\u2019t real.

It is good to know that amid this grand and grandiose fiction, the paths of the heart are indeed lonely hunters, and good too to be gently reminded of the axiom that no one gets out alive.

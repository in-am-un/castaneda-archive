Wait...

If you could just get clean (make it to the orange zone), you'd feel so much better.\n\nBut it's so darned fun down there!\n\nIt's said to be what did in the Nagual Julian. But it's also said, La Catalina survived it, after Julian had gone (to the IOB world at 110 years old?)\n\nAt any rate, it's our job to play down there at least a little. ALL of the cool stuff in the early books was pure red zone. The \"Men of Knowledge\" were all about rituals leading to the red zone.\n\nMostly using drugs too, in order to move their assemblage points.\n\nCertainly you don't need power plants to get there, but you have to know that in the first place, put in a bunch of hard work, and discover it's true.\n\nYou guys know, so no excuses. Occasionally I feel like rescuing people in the drug subreddits, because one crosses my path.\n\nBut then I remember the horrible \"men of knowledge\" visitors we had, and realize it's hopeless. They're hooked to using power plants, and then doing what they did last time, that produces the best results.\n\nGive them 1000 years, and they'll evolve into full on \"Men of Knowledge.' But trying to turn them into seers is a lost cause.\n\nThe Men of Knowledge just wanted good product to sell, and good stories to exploit.\n\nAnd so they never learned to see.\n\n\"But so what?\", was their thinking. They had status in the community.\n\nIf they needed more status, they'd give a child to the old seers. Instant fame! Bakery and mask sales skyrocket when your child is now in the hands of the old seers.\n\nWe're sort of seeing that whole thing repeat now, right before our eyes. Minus giving up your firstborn that is.\n\nBut give it time. Some of those phony sorcery teachers out there, like \"Chief Running Bull\", probably have their eyes on your kid or your wife.\n\nI'm probably going to get trouble from Cholita over that.\n\nSo on a happier topic, the red zone is not just for shapeshifting.\n\nOr better put, the puffs are you.\n\nThey're pieces of your own body.\n\nBut don't beat me for saying that. It's all Fancy's evil idea.\n\nFancy is like the Goth girl in high school, whom everyone knows to avoid.\n\nIf she takes a fancy to you (pun???), she'll take you behind the bleachers, explain that none of that school stuff matters, it's all make believe.\n\nThen she'll show you \"what really matters\".\n\nNo you pervert... Not that.\n\nFor example, green puffs.\n\nHere's Fancy's point of view, when she's being honest.\n\nDoesn't matter what color you think the puff is.\n\nWhat matters is whether it holds your attention more than the other puffs.\n\nTHAT moves the assemblage point sideways.\n\nWhere the fun happens.\n\nAnd since it's a piece of your own body, you can make it into anything.\n\nA conscious power object for example.\n\nBut a mascot is not out of the question.\n\nSo I'm counting on you guys, because I have too much to do.\n\nFind a green puff, and turn it into the Pillsbury Doughboy for me.\n\nKeep him around a few weeks, running around on the furniture.\n\nI just want some proof it can be done, and that Fancy wasn't pulling my leg.\n\nBy the way, the Doughboy is from World War One!\n\nSo don't turn your back on him.\n\nIt's been a long time with no fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Mysterious

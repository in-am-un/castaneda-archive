We probably all heard it before, but I\u2019ll go into more detail in order to help out people who have no experience with this. The instructions include some requirements, but don\u2019t let that stop you. If you don\u2019t have the requirements, imagine you do as part of the technique. The main thing is to try it as soon as possible.   And if you have any questions, I can probably answer them.\n\n1. Get a very comfy chair that you can sink into, if you fall asleep but are awake.   You\u2019ll be paralyzed in that case, so make sure that if you\u2019re paralyzed, at least the chair won\u2019t dig into you.\n\nMake sure there\u2019s sides on it, in case you enter into dreaming.   It wouldn\u2019t be unusual to sleep walk while doing this exercise, which might just amount to falling sideways.\n\nThe sides will help wake you up if you end up in a phantom copy of your room.  I once drove the armchair through the wall and down the street.  That\u2019s fine.  Nothing to worry about in that case, and you don\u2019t need any brakes.  But leaving the armchair could be a little risky until you get used to walking in your sleep.\n\nThe cheapest old beat up armchair from the second hand store would be excellent if you don\u2019t have one.  Sometimes you can get those for free, when someone drops it off at night, or the store doesn\u2019t want it.\n\nOr best yet, try to get the armchair from \u201cThe Matrix\u201d.  Carlos liked that movie; he might visit just to see it.   Or, something that looks like Carlos might visit.\n\n2. Go to the river and find rocks which fit perfectly between all of your fingers. That\u2019ll be 4 on the left, and 4 on the right.  Don\u2019t settle for almost ok, get the best.  The fingers will be slightly curved when you use them, so fit them to curved fingers.  And yes, some are longer than others.  They should likely tend to be a little flat too. That makes them easier to keep in place. And well rounded so that there\u2019s no hard edges.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing magic about curling the fingers.  It\u2019s just so that you can grip the rocks better.  If you\u2019re a Mr. Spock fan and can do the finger salute, I guess you could keep the fingers straight while you squeeze them together.  Might even work better.   But curved is the usual way.\n\nSomeone in class even duct taped the rocks between their fingers so they\u2019d be in place all night.  I suspect that isn\u2019t really helpful, but the enthusiasm is good.  Maybe some mittens if you feel like doing that.\n\nWhen you find them, make sure they\u2019re ideal.  And now, never change them.  Those 8 will become power objects, so don\u2019t show disloyalty to them by always trading up for a better rock.\n\n3. Shout \u201cINTENT!!!\u201d as loudly as you can, while looking into the distant clouds just above the horizon.  But while shouting \"Intent!!!\", be thinking \"I need silence!\"\n\nYou\u2019ve just intended some help from infinity.\n\nIf you\u2019re shy, it\u2019s fine to do this where there are no people.  You don\u2019t have to shout it all night long in the middle of Westwood, as one woman was rumored to have done.  Once is more than enough.\n\n4.  Sit in the armchair, and estimate the size of small pillow you could hug, so that the top of the pillow could help hold your head up.  It\u2019s just because you will almost surely learn to fall asleep while awake, and it\u2019s uncomfortable if your head fell to your chest.  Mostly you won\u2019t use the pillow unless you run into this issue, but keep it in arms range when practicing.  I just keep it on my lap, because it\u2019s also nice to rest the hands with the rocks on the pillow, so squeezing them is all you have to worry about.\n\n5. Now you\u2019re ready to do the technique.  It might be best if the light in the room is subdued, in case you have dreaming visions.   Less light makes those easier to follow.\n\nJust sit in the chair with eyes closed, rocks between the fingers, and stop that internal dialogue. Don\u2019t fret if you can\u2019t even go 1 second without some word popping into your mind.   In fact, that\u2019s not an issue. That isn\u2019t what causes the internal dialogue, it\u2019s only a symptom.  And this is also why you have the rocks. Squeeze harder to go longer!\n\nYou\u2019re looking specifically for the \u201cthing\u201d that causes the internal dialogue.  That\u2019s your attention, focusing on something.  In the beginning it\u2019ll just feel like an annoying memory you can\u2019t get out of your head.   But in its purest form, it\u2019s a beam of awareness you focus on reality. It directs the assemblage point.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more I can say about how to silence it; that\u2019s personal.  Or maybe it\u2019s not, but we don\u2019t have enough people who can describe what it\u2019s like for them, to know if there\u2019s some universal advice for how to proceed in stopping it.\n\nHere\u2019s what you are looking for:\n\nA.  You blank out and forget what you were doing.  That\u2019s good!  Just resume.  At first, we can\u2019t retain awareness after a shift of the assemblage point. We\u2019ve been trained to be unaware when that happens, with TV even telling us, the more unconscious you are at night, the better.   They call it, \u201cDeep restful sleep\u201d.  In fact, you're just resting from your obesessive internal dialogue.  Once you can stop it, you're always resting.\n\nUnfortunately, you will need a little practice to give up that bad habit of becoming unconscious at night.  You get the practice during this frustrating stage where you believe you can\u2019t remember to keep practicing and are repeatedly dozing off or blanking out. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening at all.\n\nB. Your head falls forward in a jarring way.  That\u2019s good!  You fell asleep, but you retained awareness.  Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have noticed it.   Try to notice it earlier in the fall.\n\nFalling means you moved your assemblage point.  Even better if it keeps falling forward, only seconds after you had to lift it back up.  Keep that up.  You\u2019re making your assemblage point\u2019s position a tiny bit more flexible.  It\u2019s sort of like leaving tiny little candles along a long dark path, so that you can go back more easily.\n\nBut don't bop it up and down on purpose, like a heavy metal fan.  Nothing in sorcery requires pretending, and simulating the result doesn't get you anything.  We've all been pretending long enough!  Time for the real thing.\n\nC. Weird sensations like falling, expanding, or traveling.   Spatial distortions, despite the fact that you have your eyes closed.\n\nThat\u2019s the assemblage point moving. Try to learn what it feels like, and extend it.  Try to make it move slower and last longer.  But forget about that book deal for now, that\u2019ll just make it move back.\n\nD. A perception of light but with your eyes closed, and the light doesn\u2019t seem to correspond to the light in the room.  Fan the light by rotating your sight of it.  Just look around the edges in a clockwise path.\n\nBlow into the center of it.  Try to figure out how to make it brighter, but don\u2019t forget to keep up the silence.   And did you forget to press the rocks?  Don\u2019t.\n\nThe interaction with a \u201creal phenomena\u201d (like seeing that light and trying to make it stronger), will give you feedback for deeper silence.    That means, you\u2019ll realize what is at the base of silence that you can emphasize, and it makes the light brighter.  You\u2019ve got yourself a \u201csilence meter\u201d, which gives measurements on how silent you are!\n\nYou've also got something to focus your attention on, so it doesn't fantasize.\n\nEventually, if you learn how to increase the silence so that it\u2019ll increase the brightness, you\u2019ll stop the world.  But don\u2019t expect to realize that until later.  Despite what's implied in Carlos' books, there's no orgasm associated with stopping the world.\n\nE. You can suddenly see the room, or the floor and your legs, but your eyes are closed.  Jackpot!  You\u2019re soundly in the second attention.  You\u2019ve activated the dreaming body. And it's a dream copy of your room!  Isn't that a 3rd or 4th gate of dreaming thing?\n\nBut don\u2019t expect one time to be a big deal.  You have to keep it up.  And so if you can see the room with your eyes closed, don\u2019t get impatient. Keep watching it as long as you can. If you get a strange idea that you can interact with it, but remain in the chair, go for it.\n\nI don\u2019t recommend standing up and walking into your dream vision, unless it\u2019s in your dreaming body.  And you can\u2019t \u201ccause\u201d that to happen; you just realize at one point, you could do it. So you do.\n\nAnother thing that can happen is, to be aware through both at the same time.  You see your dream vision, but you can \"shift\" back to only being in the chair.  And then you can hold them both at the same time by slowly opening your eyes, while keeping the dream.\n\nDon't.  You'll vomit.  I can only presume, you've tapped into the edge of the third attention, or else I can't figure a reason to puke.   But you will.  Only do 1 at a time, but shifting back and forth between them is very good practice.\n\nF. You see a dreaming scene, but you're fully aware that you're still sitting in the chair.  That\u2019s the dreaming attention activated.  Just watch it as long as you can.  It\u2019s also good to interact with it.  Speak to the people you see in the visions.  But don\u2019t forget to force yourself silent, even though it\u2019s gotten very entertaining.  If you don\u2019t, the internal dialogue will be stimulated by the dreaming scene, and it\u2019ll fade away.\n\nG. You go into a dream.  Typically, it feels like you just forgot and fell asleep.  You didn\u2019t.  You moved your assemblage point, and retained some residue of waking consciousness.\n\nIf you retain enough residue to remember to look at your hands, find out who\u2019s around that you can interact with, and interact with them.  Pick someone nice looking who seems to take an interest in you, and remember that if it gets difficult, you can stare at them until they change into something else, or go away.\n\nH. You hear a very loud knocking on the door.  I don\u2019t know what the hell that is. If anyone figures it out, let me know. I got tired of getting up to see no one there. Fortunately, you'll become familiar with what sound from the second attention is like, versus sound from this reality.  So you won't have to get up.\n\nI. You hear the phone ring, but in fact it did not.  See #H.  Oddly, Joshu Sasaki used this for his \"koan\".  But I'm not sure he really thought you'd hear the phone ring when it really hadn't.  He was just trying to \"amercanize\" his zen puzzles.\n\nJ. Someone shouts your name.  That\u2019s very good! It means someone (inorganic?) noticed your efforts and you might get a little help if you keep it up.  Try to notice if it\u2019s a male or female voice.   I hate to admit it, but once I heard Kylie shout my full name, like a scolding mother.  But it was fortunate. I was in a blank world of fog with no thoughts, and wouldn't have remembered that I stopped the world, without that shout.\n\nK. You see a single object.  That's useful for understanding \"intent\".  Try stating another object  you'd like, something simple like \"spatula\".  Eventually you can learn to see anything you request.  When you can do that, you can pan over the city looking down.  You just ask for a building in the city, and when you see it, intend it to scroll.  But watch out for requesting things like, \"panties\". You'll get them, complete with model, but it'll become a bad habit.   You'll become fascinated with tinkering with the model and her ethnicity.  And then they'll show up without asking.\n\nL. Something swoops across the room, possibly from the upper right to the lower left.  You perceive it as soundless and sightless, since your eyes are closed, but somehow black.  And you'll realize, something has been swooping periodically all of your life.  That's an inorganic being.  But you can't interact with it at that level, it won't do any good to watch for swooping.   If it's there to help you,  you'll just \"coincidentally\" have a flashy experience within a short amount of time.  Could be as long as 10 minutes through.  Or the swoop might bring back your internal dialogue, and you'll be out of luck for that help.\n\nM. The back of your neck at the head makes a loud popping sound.  This is likely caused by relaxing in a way you don't normally relax the neck muscles, and the head re-aligns to the end of the spine.  Carlos mentioned this sound in one of his books, saying it's the second attention popping out.  If you have this effect, it certainly means the silence is relaxing you.  Try to remember what just happened before it.  Were you in a vision?\n\nN. Your breathing changes to become automatic and smooth, and if you have asthma, it goes away.  It means you're getting more silent.  But don't try to simulate that breath. Let it happen naturally so you can use it as a tool to judge success.\n\nO. There's a blinding flash of light, and a very loud explosion sound.  My theory on why this happens is that your assemblage point moved, you remained there perhaps unaware for some time, but then started to notice it and energy was released.  That reminded you of an explosion because explosions also cause a sudden shift of the assemblage point, due to fright.   So your second attention made an explosion for you. On the other hand, there might be another cause, but it's not uncommon to experience this.   The meditation people might have said, \"you released stress\".  Not quite.  You released energy.  A movement of the assemblage point to a place you don't usually experience is often accompanied by a release of energy.\n\nP. You have a  shiver running up your body, and maybe even have goose bumps.  It's not shakti.  It's a movement of the assemblage point to a pleasant position.  Spielberg knows how to accomplish this. He tries to produce this effect towards the end of his movies. Remember when ET makes the bike fly, or when the UFO finally shows itself to everyone?  It's possible to coax the assemblage point using ordinary interactions, something Carlos coveted in his class.  I don't know his techniques except that he gave a couple of lectures on \"cognitive dissonance\".   Gazing at an object you can't recognize (such as the red rag that looked like an animal in one of Carlos' books) would qualify as using cognitive dissonance to shift the assemblage point.  It's all about moving that point, unfortunately.  Silence alone doesn't move it right away.\n\nQ. You start to see the source of the internal dialogue as images and feelings, and you can isolate individual perceptions.  You realize some of them belong to a string that flows automatically, against your desire.  They feel like a point in space that you could ignore, if you could just relax.   You're at the very very start of losing the human form.\n\nZ. A book deal.  Watch out for that too.  It\u2019s the fliers mind coming to bring you back to reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: 9 times (there's a lot of things to add)", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Simple Silence Technique", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_bskqmx", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 59, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 59, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1559240726.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1558724170.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s a simple silence technique Carlos gave us.

And so if you can see the room with your eyes closed, don\u2019t get impatient. Keep watching it as long as you can. If you get a strange idea that you can interact with it, but remain in the chair, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t recommend standing up and walking into your dream vision, unless it\u2019s in your dreaming body.  And you can\u2019t \u201ccause\u201d that to happen; you just realize at one point, you could do it. So you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing that can happen is, to be aware through both at the same time.  You see your dream vision, but you can &amp;quot;shift&amp;quot; back to only being in the chair.  And then you can hold them both at the same time by slowly opening your eyes, while keeping the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t.  You&amp;#39;ll vomit.  I can only presume, you&amp;#39;ve tapped into the edge of the third attention, or else I can&amp;#39;t figure a reason to puke.   But you will.  Only do 1 at a time, but shifting back and forth between them is very good practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;F. You see a dreaming scene, but you&amp;#39;re fully aware that you&amp;#39;re still sitting in the chair.  That\u2019s the dreaming attention activated.  Just watch it as long as you can.  It\u2019s also good to interact with it.  Speak to the people you see in the visions.  But don\u2019t forget to force yourself silent, even though it\u2019s gotten very entertaining.  If you don\u2019t, the internal dialogue will be stimulated by the dreaming scene, and it\u2019ll fade away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;G. You go into a dream.  Typically, it feels like you just forgot and fell asleep.  You didn\u2019t.  You moved your assemblage point, and retained some residue of waking consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you retain enough residue to remember to look at your hands, find out who\u2019s around that you can interact with, and interact with them.  Pick someone nice looking who seems to take an interest in you, and remember that if it gets difficult, you can stare at them until they change into something else, or go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H. You hear a very loud knocking on the door.  I don\u2019t know what the hell that is. If anyone figures it out, let me know. I got tired of getting up to see no one there. Fortunately, you&amp;#39;ll become familiar with what sound from the second attention is like, versus sound from this reality.  So you won&amp;#39;t have to get up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I. You hear the phone ring, but in fact it did not.  See #H.  Oddly, Joshu Sasaki used this for his &amp;quot;koan&amp;quot;.  But I&amp;#39;m not sure he really thought you&amp;#39;d hear the phone ring when it really hadn&amp;#39;t.  He was just trying to &amp;quot;amercanize&amp;quot; his zen puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;J. Someone shouts your name.  That\u2019s very good! It means someone (inorganic?) noticed your efforts and you might get a little help if you keep it up.  Try to notice if it\u2019s a male or female voice.   I hate to admit it, but once I heard Kylie shout my full name, like a scolding mother.  But it was fortunate. I was in a blank world of fog with no thoughts, and wouldn&amp;#39;t have remembered that I stopped the world, without that shout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;K. You see a single object.  That&amp;#39;s useful for understanding &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;.  Try stating another object  you&amp;#39;d like, something simple like &amp;quot;spatula&amp;quot;.  Eventually you can learn to see anything you request.  When you can do that, you can pan over the city looking down.  You just ask for a building in the city, and when you see it, intend it to scroll.  But watch out for requesting things like, &amp;quot;panties&amp;quot;. You&amp;#39;ll get them, complete with model, but it&amp;#39;ll become a bad habit.   You&amp;#39;ll become fascinated with tinkering with the model and her ethnicity.  And then they&amp;#39;ll show up without asking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;L. Something swoops across the room, possibly from the upper right to the lower left.  You perceive it as soundless and sightless, since your eyes are closed, but somehow black.  And you&amp;#39;ll realize, something has been swooping periodically all of your life.  That&amp;#39;s an inorganic being.  But you can&amp;#39;t interact with it at that level, it won&amp;#39;t do any good to watch for swooping.   If it&amp;#39;s there to help you,  you&amp;#39;ll just &amp;quot;coincidentally&amp;quot; have a flashy experience within a short amount of time.  Could be as long as 10 minutes through.  Or the swoop might bring back your internal dialogue, and you&amp;#39;ll be out of luck for that help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;M. The back of your neck at the head makes a loud popping sound.  This is likely caused by relaxing in a way you don&amp;#39;t normally relax the neck muscles, and the head re-aligns to the end of the spine.  Carlos mentioned this sound in one of his books, saying it&amp;#39;s the second attention popping out.  If you have this effect, it certainly means the silence is relaxing you.  Try to remember what just happened before it.  Were you in a vision?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;N. Your breathing changes to become automatic and smooth, and if you have asthma, it goes away.  It means you&amp;#39;re getting more silent.  But don&amp;#39;t try to simulate that breath. Let it happen naturally so you can use it as a tool to judge success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;O. There&amp;#39;s a blinding flash of light, and a very loud explosion sound.  My theory on why this happens is that your assemblage point moved, you remained there perhaps unaware for some time, but then started to notice it and energy was released.  That reminded you of an explosion because explosions also cause a sudden shift of the assemblage point, due to fright.   So your second attention made an explosion for you. On the other hand, there might be another cause, but it&amp;#39;s not uncommon to experience this.   The meditation people might have said, &amp;quot;you released stress&amp;quot;.  Not quite.  You released energy.  A movement of the assemblage point to a place you don&amp;#39;t usually experience is often accompanied by a release of energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P. You have a  shiver running up your body, and maybe even have goose bumps.  It&amp;#39;s not shakti.  It&amp;#39;s a movement of the assemblage point to a pleasant position.  Spielberg knows how to accomplish this. He tries to produce this effect towards the end of his movies. Remember when ET makes the bike fly, or when the UFO finally shows itself to everyone?  It&amp;#39;s possible to coax the assemblage point using ordinary interactions, something Carlos coveted in his class.  I don&amp;#39;t know his techniques except that he gave a couple of lectures on &amp;quot;cognitive dissonance&amp;quot;.   Gazing at an object you can&amp;#39;t recognize (such as the red rag that looked like an animal in one of Carlos&amp;#39; books) would qualify as using cognitive dissonance to shift the assemblage point.  It&amp;#39;s all about moving that point, unfortunately.  Silence alone doesn&amp;#39;t move it right away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Q. You start to see the source of the internal dialogue as images and feelings, and you can isolate individual perceptions.  You realize some of them belong to a string that flows automatically, against your desire.  They feel like a point in space that you could ignore, if you could just relax.   You&amp;#39;re at the very very start of losing the human form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Z. A book deal.  Watch out for that too.  It\u2019s the fliers mind coming to bring you back to reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: 9 times (there&amp;#39;s a lot of things to add)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "1a0d5e9c-6005-11ea-8472-0e86798f0183", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "bskqmx", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 63, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/bskqmx/simple_silence_technique/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/bskqmx/simple_silence_technique/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1558724170.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j2tu3vh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j2tj220", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Right, maybe that's what I remembered.

Sounded like Kylie last time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing in Carlos&amp;#39; books that many might not pick up on as &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot; is don Juan talking about how sorcerers witness everything, but no one else realizes it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get silent all day long, it will only be a few weeks before you understand that statement, and wonder how on earth Carlos could have written that, if he made it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found half of my stones, I&amp;#39;ll try to figure out how to post a picture. It&amp;#39;s the left hand set.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were &amp;quot;Carlos Approved&amp;quot;.  I believe he even put them between his fingers to give an example of how to curl them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re also crude enough that no one seeing them will become obsessed with the rocks having to be pretty.  Amethysts and Topaz crystals are unnecessary.  Simple mountain river rocks are fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course if you want fancy crystals, that&amp;#39;s fine. But don&amp;#39;t put off practicing until they&amp;#39;re shiny enough.  You won&amp;#39;t need them for an illustration in your book deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One more thing:   I&amp;#39;ve found that the brightest colors consistently take 1 hour to form.  I suspect the eyes need to get used to the dark, and that causes the amplifier to be turned up full, revealing the FPN.  But all it looks like, is patches of color so bright, no one would believe you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_bskqmx", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/bskqmx/simple_silence_technique/ephx9qn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1559232151.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "epeeb23", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1559181690.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_bskqmx", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I've gotten to just shy of two hours with the rocks sitting in the dark and gazing at the fixed pattern noise; and my internal dialogue does indeed eventually stop before it can get going; like a car engine reving-up but unable to get into gear, so it can't go anywhere. \n\nBut I have an earworm problem.

Just the easy stuff that leaves them in control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;As an idea, started writing down my dreams, a dream journal if you will.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a huge mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, learn to produce reliable magic, through hard work and never missing a practice, and then when you do something especially cool, eyes wide open, fully awake, walking around, make a picture and post it here, with a description.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That activity is rewarded by &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But only if you really did what you drew and posted about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;journal&amp;quot; will doom you, the way it doomed the rest of our Castaneda community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also the #1 tool of con artists who charge people money to &amp;quot;teach&amp;quot; them sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s self-flattering, and all they have to do to keep the person paying money, is listen to one of their annoying dreams and call it progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos didn&amp;#39;t tolerate even a full sentence which started with &amp;quot;I had this dream last week...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true that in some cases Carlos encouraged journals, but look at his results!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one...  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He taught no one at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because died too soon, but still.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His efforts beyond writing the books almost led to the total loss of all of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He almost &amp;quot;undid&amp;quot; the positive influence of his books, with his attempts to a &amp;quot;teach&amp;quot; sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the organization he set up is doing their best to erase it all by &amp;quot;making it appropriate for our modern age&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By turning it into nothing but childish pretending, like everything else out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have access to some of their &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s totally horrible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can be sure they include &amp;quot;make a journal&amp;quot; in there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_bskqmx", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/bskqmx/simple_silence_technique/kgfu5do/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1704466934.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kgf9j30", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kga2fv4", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/bskqmx/simple_silence_technique/kgf9j30/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_kgf9j30", "created": 1704457766.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1704457766.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kga2fv4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kg7xj4f", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "We only get paid in here, for the very hard efforts I might add, if someone learns for real.

As if we were there at that time, 8000 years ago perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s a longer explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our double is the half of our awareness encased in the egg, which couldn&amp;#39;t fit into our flesh bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The half that managed to hang out inside the flesh, is called our &amp;quot;Tonal&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as a result of being tied to the flesh, it has &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot; and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the other half either didn&amp;#39;t fit, or refused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And our endless internal dialogue, filled primarily with suffering, has driven it away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, it likes to come closer to our Tonal from time to time, to get a sense of &amp;quot;purpose&amp;quot;, and also out of curiosity about it&amp;#39;s doppelganger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery teaches you to lure it to swirl around your body, and eventually cling and form a blue bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like this one:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/m7kp72qo99ec1.jpeg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9b0ed5d2c14bfc7967dab28e967e891244a0cda6\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/m7kp72qo99ec1.jpeg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9b0ed5d2c14bfc7967dab28e967e891244a0cda6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I daily get that to form, and I can assure you, it&amp;#39;s completely visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as bright as you see there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you play with it daily, it eventually likes that and if you sleep in too long, it&amp;#39;ll wake you up to &amp;quot;come play more&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often using dazzling light shows to try to snap you out of your desire to remain asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are sentient beings, with their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So possibly, it was YOU Knocking on the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t matter what voice you heard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita the witch, trained by Carlos, can imitate anyone in her double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looks just like the real thing, unless she&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;editorializing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She made a copy of me once, and sat on the end of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought it was my own double, until I noticed it was quite a bit overweight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_bskqmx", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/bskqmx/simple_silence_technique/kj953qp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1706044677.0, "media_metadata": {"m7kp72qo99ec1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpeg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m7kp72qo99ec1.jpeg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb8532030701847df131aff80f3d69a3a782f925"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m7kp72qo99ec1.jpeg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67a90ff1fc54f3e41d9c778db51f3b677d257e36"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m7kp72qo99ec1.jpeg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd30b599ebbc61e695b970f41eef70cddbefc5b9"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m7kp72qo99ec1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17c992ecd956fffd744dad028a419cc8f4ab8b7b"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m7kp72qo99ec1.jpeg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a20fbcf5e6e9d1223e25ba34bf69a0933a478da"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m7kp72qo99ec1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd02c6907f0f6a0c323401f3de70ecfb90b13c95"}], "s": {"y": 3592, "x": 3592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/m7kp72qo99ec1.jpeg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b0ed5d2c14bfc7967dab28e967e891244a0cda6"}, "id": "m7kp72qo99ec1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kj8zd7z", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "draculahere", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1706042803.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_bskqmx", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_rse8aw9xr", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I wondered when I read about I and J.

Intent itself will lead you, in a manner as wise as don Juan.\n\nAnd with seemingly God like knowledge of the future.\n\nBut why didn't Carlos do that in the first place?\n\nLook around in this subreddit. Then you'll understand. Before they can get rid of the internal dialogue, people are filled to the brink with self-pity, which they try to compensate for with attention from other people.\n\nIt was other people who forced that point of view on them, based on the need to get along with other people, in order to survive as a baby.\n\nSo it's only natural they'd have weird tricks they developed in order to fit in with their particular family power structure.\n\nBottom line: Non-sorcerers really suck!\n\nThey'll do just about anything to get what they want.\n\nEven fake illness, danger, fright, all in an attempt to gain more attention from the leader.\n\nNot all do this of course. But you've all run into the \"mama's boy\" type.\n\n\"Oh mommy, I have a boo-boo!!!\"\n\nCarlos couldn't have that. Even with an actual apprentice and no others to take care of, it's pretty awful.\n\nDon Juan would just get little smoke to go scare the hell out of them. Problem solved quickly.\n\nIt's like that story about the misbehaving boy.\n\nCarlos asked don Juan how to deal with him, and don Juan said to hire the ugliest homeless person he could find, have them hide where the boy would pass, and then jump out and beat him up.\n\nChange his understanding of the world so he got away from his petty worry about getting attention from others.\n\nWhat Carlos had in mind, instead of having Little Smoke do her angry demon basket with teeth imitation, is to let people do tensegrity which balances the energy in the body, while doing recapitulation to give them an understanding of what's behind their nasty personality.\n\nMeanwhile he emphasized silence all the time. But he didn't force the issue until the very end.\n\nI suppose the thought was, if someone decides to learn silence on their own then that person is not likely to freak out when all hell breaks loose.\n\nAs it always does if you manage to get silent.\n\nBut Carlos ran out of time.\n\nSo he tried to teach us to \"read off the wall\".\n\nThat's the orange zone on the J curve.\n\nQuite a tall order for his students, to move their assemblage points that far, but what choice did he have?\n\nMy guess is, he didn't expect that to work at all. He was simply wanting to give us what we needed before he left, and then it was up to us.\n\nAnd he did! We have what we need.\n\nTo make sure, he explained what we were to do without him.\n\nLearn to move on the J curve, so we didn't need a Nagual anymore.\n\nThis poster was likely drawn by the Blue Scout.\n\nI ought to know, because she was standing so close to me when she held it out for my view, I could have moved a finger 2 inches and touched her hand.\n\nCarlos said she had drawn that, and they made a few copies (perhaps \ud83d\udcf7, and handed them out in private class.\n\nEllis saw me towards the end of class, shook her head oddly as if she just remembered Carlos had instructed her to give me one, and then glanced back. Someone nodded, and she handed it to me.\n\nI lost mine on purpose, which is another story.\n\nThey made some and handed them out at workshops.\n\nIf Cholita was more friendly to me I'd ask her about it. She likely did some of the handing out. She often worked the \"book store\", and the front, in exchange for free entry and for transportation to workshops out of the state.\n\nIf it was the blue scout who introduced us to it, that means Carlos was using the energy of a woman to bring up a new topic.\n\nHe often did that.\n\nCarol Tiggs was the bonus energy choice.\n\nIf she did it, it had the energy of a double being behind it.\n\nIn fact, when Carol Tiggs did her \"stage magic trick\" and took 4 or so total people at 2 different events, leaning them back by the shoulders onto the floor, I suspect she was denting their shell.\n\nA \"flat dent\" that would only last a few minutes.  \n\nBut Carlos only told us she was going to \"show us something\".  He could also have intended it himself, using Carol's energy.\n\nBut if you get a chance to have Carol perform her stage magic on you, absolutely don't say no!\n\nShe has the death defier in there too!\n\nI suppose if she'd slapped our shoulder everyone would have freaked out, and there would be mass Carol Tiggs hysteria.\n\nSo he hid what she was doing.\n\nThe instant I touched the floor of Dance Home, with Carol Tiggs holding my shoulder, I fell right through 2 floors, through the foundation of the building, and landed on my butt in a dirt tunnel.\n\nAn entry to the inorganic being's realm.\n\nPossibly, it's why I handle them so easily now.  I commonly visit their world to get more dark energy.\n\nSo the effect of using the energy of women was not something mild. It could be very dramatic.\n\nThat's why women are fond first, when starting a lineage.\n\nEven without training, women are as Cholita likes to say:\n\nWomen are witches, as long as they just ***know*** it!\n\nIt's how we got the J curve. Carlos used a woman to demonstrate the path, and because I was celibate and she was wearing a tight black outfit, I remembered it.\n\nI can't find anyone else who does, despite there being 50 people in that room by Cholita's estimation.\n\nCleargreen even ignored it and never taught it at workshops.\n\nIf it was the blue scout who was showing us the poster, and given credit for painting it, Carlos was using his second best source of female energy.\n\nCarol would not have been appropriate, if you think about it a bit.\n\nIt needed to be someone ordinary, and new to private classes, so we'd get the impression if she had done that, than so could we.\n\nHow come I don't know if it was the blue scout, even though she was standing right next to me, and I'd seen her a lot of times?\n\nProsopagnosia.\n\nLook it up. It's rather amusing.\n\nI suppose I make the ideal person to relate the old private classes, because I can't ever tell you who did what, with any certainty.\n\nKeep in mind, this is my rendition of the poster. Best I can recall after 22 years.\n\nSo if anyone has their copy (it's certain Cleargreen does), please snap a pic with your cellphone and post it!\n\nBut don't assume \"the wall\" always looks like that.\n\nIn fact, the wall is merely \"seeing energy\" in a useful oracle form.\n\nYou could use a crystal ball to do that too.\n\nOr the air in front of you, in the dark room.\n\nOne thing I can tell you about \"the wall\" is that if you use your actual bedroom wall, inorganic beings LOVE it.\n\nNot only will they sit above your version of the wall, like Loki the trickster God adding his personal touch, but they will open it up for you to physically travel into.\n\nMeaning, they'll help you step through the solid wall, into another world.\n\nTry explaining that the next day!  We don't sit there with our eyes closed, like the Buddha.\n\nWe do it all fully awake, sober, with our eyes open.\n\nAnd taking a running leap through solid plaster and glass, is just something that happens.\n\nSo remember, the wall isn't just good for text messages from infinity.\n\nIt's a portal to the entire universe!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Missing Poster Again", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"fvbur1yt5de71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 144, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fvbur1yt5de71.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94976892aa01111d7daa6d87e367654e801e2f5f"}, {"y": 288, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fvbur1yt5de71.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c43f8cafd5c363d8a9d6cf0a9e6ce6bb6dd188d"}, {"y": 426, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fvbur1yt5de71.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dc9eeab1d039bcc317201c20ec8cefde3177f44"}, {"y": 853, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fvbur1yt5de71.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcc610244d5d061cfba1282b1b4add0323173339"}], "s": {"y": 960, "x": 720, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/fvbur1yt5de71.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e70d9b5d8cc0323d78df1677ac165e111aeb787"}, "id": "fvbur1yt5de71"}}, "name": "t3_oumhr1", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/rTSCJkWraNtB1aC3Xry38adBPpCM1M3xaCxISqh6XFQ.jpg", "edited": 1627659289.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1627657950.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fvbur1yt5de71.jpg?width=720&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4e70d9b5d8cc0323d78df1677ac165e111aeb787\"&gt;The Missing Poster, Given Out At A Workshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Towards the end when Carlos knew he was going to die, he tried to &amp;quot;speed us up&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible to do that by getting people to concentrate on nothing but manifesting the second attention, and forcing silence, so that the assemblage point drifts along the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goal is to see &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot; as soon as possible, so you get at least some informational link to intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you had a full link to intent, you&amp;#39;d no longer need a teacher.

We don&amp;#39;t sit there with our eyes closed, like the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do it all fully awake, sober, with our eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And taking a running leap through solid plaster and glass, is just something that happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So remember, the wall isn&amp;#39;t just good for text messages from infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a portal to the entire universe!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "oumhr1", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 12, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/oumhr1/missing_poster_again/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/oumhr1/missing_poster_again/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1627657950.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h74v9qo", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "elainebeth", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h74si4r", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_4qqswemg", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "To my knowledge I know zero about IBs.

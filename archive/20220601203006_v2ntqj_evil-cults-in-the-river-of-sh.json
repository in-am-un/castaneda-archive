Different flingers...\n\nHere beginners:  The truth for a change.  Once in a while I get asked if maybe I'm not like everyone who insists they have \"the one true truth\".  And maybe I ought to be more accepting, and look around more.\n\nExcept, I already did that!!!    For decades.\n\nI think the confusion there is, from people who don't actually have any magic yet, don't know what it is, and so they think about themselves being stubborn and insisting what they do is right, only to find out later, they were wrong.\n\nSo they believe they have some \"wisdom\" I could absorb, and take a cue from them.\n\nYea but, I DO have magic.  I can look to see if whatever I am doing makes it stronger, or makes it weaker.\n\nIt's no longer a \"river of shit moral issue\" as it is for them.\n\nSo if some of you want to be \"humble\" and accepting, that's ok by me.  But I don't know any \"saints\" who actually have any saintly super powers.\n\nMostly they're filled with self-pity, for all around them.\n\nTry getting some actual magic, daily, and then you can actually KNOW, instead of guess, if your behavior is suitable for a sorcerer or not.\n\nYou can even ask your spirit helper, and they'll tell you!  Happy to do it too.\n\nLet's get over the \"sainthood\" obsession please?!  It's a total misunderstanding of what sorcery is, to believe it's going to make you \"saintly\".\n\nJust ask Cholita, who lent me the dark energy that motivated the picture. Except that the details of that are over in the advanced subreddit.  It's just too much for beginners to believe, having only seen the pretend magic variety all their lives.\n\n\\*\\*\\* from facebook \\*\\*\\*\n\nIn the books of Carlos Castaneda, he asks about all the gurus and \"masters\" out there in the world, wondering if someone else has magic as wonderful as the lineage of don Juan. With so many people flocking around them, they must have attained something.\n\nDon Juan suggests, \"Maybe those men are just indulging in being masters?\"\n\nOne might wonder how that could come to be, but then if you consider Ram Dass, \"the man who single handedly ruined the 70s\", you realize that people will fall for anything and dishonest men will suck up the attention and money as long as they can.\n\nThere's even women kissing his feet in comments on Youtube videos, as if he had saved them from life's suffering.\n\nI suspect the only attainment of Ram Dass is a bigger bank account, and a very easy to hold fake smile, like the \"peaceful Buddha\". He poses in meditation postures, and his image is plastered all over.\n\nSome people who see that think, \"Wow, potential relief from this shitty life of suffering!\"\n\nBut Ram Dass is not unique at all. There are endless cults, phony religions, and people anxious to \"save you\". We're bombarded by them.\n\nHow can they ALL be a fake?\n\nI don't know, but don Juan told Carlos, \"It's all folly out there\".\n\nAnd when he was on his own, and able to actually do spectacular enough magic himself that he got excited to spread it to others, Carlos went looking. Being a celebrity, he had access to ANYONE.\n\nAfter years, maybe even decades of searching, he found nothing.\n\nHe told us stories of his search in private classes.\n\nAfter he died, the same thing happened to me. Carlos introduced us to his Allies, and they plagued me for a full decade. Scaring the hell out of me with each appearance, but making it undeniable that Carlos had been the real thing.\n\nFinally they pushed me into full on heightened awareness while I was on a couple of month business/stalking trip in Asia. And one of them pulled me into the inorganic being's tunnel that had been shown to me by Carol Tiggs, more than 15 years earlier. And gave me a fully visible and vivid lecture on the \"sorcerers of our lineage\", with pictures that animated like videos hanging from the walls of the tunnel. I even saw Loban the pirate's ship.  Didn't look Chinese to me.\n\nI was pretty much convinced though. I could see puffs of bluish white light made of fine lines, whenever I got into a shaded area. I could even manipulate them with my hands.\n\nI spent years trying to tell others about it. Chi Gung people, famous martial artists, witches, yogis.\n\nAnyone I could think of who ought to have known about that if they weren't just faking, I tried to tell and ask what to do next.\n\nAll of them slammed the door on me, some giving me a little kick in the pants to boot.\n\nOne who had a very famous reputation for magic, suggested I needed to talk to a counselor.\n\nAll fake. I had found exactly what Carlos had found, and what don Juan had warned.\n\nThere's no magic out there. It's all pretend.\n\nBut what of the stories?\n\nHow about Milarepa, the famous \"Tibetan Yogi\".\n\nPeople LOVE that story of the awesome meditation powers of Milarepa.\n\nI suppose that confused me for a couple of years, until I realized what was going on.\n\nIt's easy to see inorganic beings. They show up at the green line on the J curve. And to interact with them more, you don't need to move down to the red. Just shift horizontally.\n\nAnd there's \"bliss\" up there. Silence comes easier, the breath gets deeper and slows, and the whole thing can feel \"amazing\" to a beginner.\n\nIt's like heaven! And if a demon comes along and you calmly interact with it, and ignore it's attempts to frighten you, you can feel like a powerful Yogi.\n\nBecause all their experiences are also that pathetic, and exaggerated in importance.\n\nTell some friends, and you become the historical \"Great Milarepa, the Tibetan Yogi!\"\n\nBut the truth is, if you see a demon and decades later everyone is still taking about that demon, then you were a dud.\n\nA fake. A beginner who was too lazy to go further.\n\nAnyone who talks about \"demons\", is not doing what they claim to be doing.\n\nThey've had some few encounters with an inorganic being, easy to do with meditation or shamanic drumming, and then decided to \"cash in\".\n\nGo tell everyone of their great accomplishment.\n\nBut Milarepa could fly!!! Some might try to change the subject.\n\nBig deal. La Gorda could fly, and gave us the technique.\n\nI can leap to distant planets. Not asleep. Not with my eyes closed, smiling like I just farted the way the Buddha does.\n\nFully awake, eyes open, completely sober, and while standing up walking around.\n\nI just leap, and zip right through the ceiling to a distant star I liked, and look for planets to land on when I get close enough to see them.\n\nBig deal, Milarepa could fly. But no one can give you more details. Because if they did, you'd realize it's **not** such a big deal. So the \"honest\" steps he took to learn that, are not known. People revert back to \"Patanjali's aphorisms\" as if that explained anything.\n\nAlso rank beginners \"powers\". Nothing to brag about even if you get all of them to work. In fact, Patanjali didn't even seem to understand how those work, so his instructions were terrible. Impossible even.\n\nBuddhism, Daoism, and Hinduism use such poor meditation techniques that people eagerly eat up any hint that someone had success.\n\nExcept the simple fact is, there are no demons. And flying is as natural while awake, as it is in dreams.\n\nWe just didn't realize you can do waking dreaming, in your real body.\n\nCertainly no Buddhist can do that, or they wouldn't sit around with their eyes closed like that.\n\nThere are no angels either. Those are self-pity generated images the inorganic beings like to project, in order to seem important. So that you'll notice them and remember them.\n\nIf you call an inorganic being back over and over again, which is inevitable for someone making real progress, you realize that your \"Lucifer, the dark angel\", could be anything you like.\n\n\"Lucifer, the small kitten\".\n\nAnd easy to make him be so. They will eagerly take any form you desire, after a little fumbling on your part due to having a dirty link to intent.\n\nYet, \"Milarepa, the great Tibetan Yogi\", was so lame, that on his second visit by the demons they took him to \"hell\" and tortured people in front of him.\n\nTo show how calm he was, because he didn't run for his life.\n\nWow, if that isn't obvious, you need a new meditation system!\n\nOr how about that \"Buddha\" guy? One of the most \"magical\" texts in buddhism is supposedly the \"Fire Kasina\" texts.\n\nThey read like a product brochure. \"The Buddha could do this, and two of his disciples also, but not the others. And the Buddha could do THAT but no one else.\"\n\nAll totally beginner things to do, from up at the green line on the J curve map, something only sorcerers know about. NO OTHER SYSTEM (as of today) knows about the assemblage point. Once they do, remember that they stole it and can't actually move their assemblage points. They just \"added on\", the way Buddhists do from time to time, to keep up with the competition.\n\nIn the \"Sacred Fire Kasina Texts\", The Buddha saw 4 hookers dancing in blue dresses, while sitting with his eyes closed dozing off. But he was so wise he didn't take them up on the offer to do anything for him he liked.\n\nThat's Buddhist \"wisdom\".\n\nPassing on hookers.\n\nGood advice for Asia, but not particularly \"enlightened\".\n\nThere really isn't much more to brag about in Buddhism, which isn't obviously made up in anger because they got caught by something else sounding better, so they had to add on to it.\n\nLike the Dzogchen folks who tried to fool one of my readers, by claiming they did what \"nagualism\" did also, with some kind of weird, \"body of light\".\n\nAlways in a body Buddhists are. Always themselves. Always self-absorbed.\n\nAlways pretending. Always angry at others who imply they have magic, and maybe Buddhists don't.\n\nNo one with real magic gets angry over that! Only fakers get angry over someone mentioning real magic.\n\nThe truth is, \"Enlightened People\" simply \"got slimed\".\n\nSome green slime got into their eyes, made them high, and they took that as a cue to go lord it over other people.\n\nWhat 99.999% of those who claim to be \"seekers\" really want.\n\nTo fool others into believing they are \"magic men\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Evil Cults in the River of Sh..", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"mebjx89kz1391": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mebjx89kz1391.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=607654213450578847e226a69e235549b6b8030d"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mebjx89kz1391.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4140c4e3e401da4bba0a528db8f3282ab24e6c81"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mebjx89kz1391.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bc027a13944f8d92830d74ba4295447a5edf67c"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mebjx89kz1391.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82b8f9b5bc47f315e3687896fae4872cf3e5c3b6"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mebjx89kz1391.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=058f0fca8e63807b0325eb16887e635a41900f40"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mebjx89kz1391.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d51893f3ceb2277220c1ac5fc68892ef38addd12"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mebjx89kz1391.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bfa2cf12d9d2c311e71bee317d832f036de2632"}, "id": "mebjx89kz1391"}}, "name": "t3_v2ntqj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 16, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 16, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/sxKoZlSf0EAKDLVhxx8Nq3Z3Ho9ei0JF96F-Wlf7fBs.jpg", "edited": 1654109094.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1654108206.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mebjx89kz1391.png?width=2048&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6bfa2cf12d9d2c311e71bee317d832f036de2632\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/mebjx89kz1391.png?width=2048&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6bfa2cf12d9d2c311e71bee317d832f036de2632&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is from Facebook for a change, instead of the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some Dzogchen liars were trying to make a Russian/Ukrainian man feel bad, pretending they have a &amp;quot;body of light&amp;quot; that is the same as what Nagualists do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same old shit.

And the Buddha could do THAT but no one else.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All totally beginner things to do, from up at the green line on the J curve map, something only sorcerers know about. NO OTHER SYSTEM (as of today) knows about the assemblage point. Once they do, remember that they stole it and can&amp;#39;t actually move their assemblage points. They just &amp;quot;added on&amp;quot;, the way Buddhists do from time to time, to keep up with the competition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;quot;Sacred Fire Kasina Texts&amp;quot;, The Buddha saw 4 hookers dancing in blue dresses, while sitting with his eyes closed dozing off. But he was so wise he didn&amp;#39;t take them up on the offer to do anything for him he liked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s Buddhist &amp;quot;wisdom&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Passing on hookers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good advice for Asia, but not particularly &amp;quot;enlightened&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There really isn&amp;#39;t much more to brag about in Buddhism, which isn&amp;#39;t obviously made up in anger because they got caught by something else sounding better, so they had to add on to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the Dzogchen folks who tried to fool one of my readers, by claiming they did what &amp;quot;nagualism&amp;quot; did also, with some kind of weird, &amp;quot;body of light&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always in a body Buddhists are. Always themselves. Always self-absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always pretending. Always angry at others who imply they have magic, and maybe Buddhists don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one with real magic gets angry over that! Only fakers get angry over someone mentioning real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is, &amp;quot;Enlightened People&amp;quot; simply &amp;quot;got slimed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some green slime got into their eyes, made them high, and they took that as a cue to go lord it over other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What 99.999% of those who claim to be &amp;quot;seekers&amp;quot; really want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To fool others into believing they are &amp;quot;magic men&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "v2ntqj", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 7, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/v2ntqj/evil_cults_in_the_river_of_sh/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/v2ntqj/evil_cults_in_the_river_of_sh/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1654108206.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iau02ac", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "New_Ant_8026", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1654117118.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_v2ntqj", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_ca7vxg27", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Thank you.

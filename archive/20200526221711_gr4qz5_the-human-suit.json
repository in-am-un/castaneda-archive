If man will strike, strike through the mask!_\u2014Herman Melville\u2019s _Moby Dick_.\n\nSome have asked me about the pharmaceutical cocktail I take in recent weeks. The nature of the cocktail is for allowing me to _pass_ as a human which is a skill you\u2019ll have to relearn after your symbolic death. I borrow the term Psycho-Pass for my cocktail after my favorite anime series by the same name. It\u2019s about a dystopian future where humanity is under constant surveillance psychologically and those who don\u2019t pass \u201cevaluations\u201d by advanced software embedded into everything, in particular guns, are locked away in prison cells until they are no longer mentally divergent from the bell curve used.\nOur world operates more or less the same, except instead of AI evaluating us, it\u2019s the medical industry\u2014they have full power in today\u2019s world\u2014they determine if you have custody over your children, whether you can retire, whether you qualify for disability, and basically whether you deserve to live or die.\nWhat this post discusses are two things:\n1. Psychology: a perspective on symbolic death.\n2. Psychiatry: a perspective on the psychiatry industry.\n3. Psycho-Pass: a human suit for synthetic sorcery.\n# Psychology\nAs we all know Carlos talked about how it\u2019s hard to remember things that occur during heightened awareness, but scientifically, why is this? It\u2019s hard to ignore all the NDEs where people claim their life \u201cflashed before their eyes\u201d. Does this imply the closer you are to dying, the better you can recollect? Does this suggest adrenaline will induce memory retrieval then? [Studies] show that indeed stress hormones are the pathways for consolidating memories and recovering them. This is no surprise though, everyone knows that stressful events in their lives are the most memorable, and makes sense from a evolutionary standpoint, in that it increases an organism\u2019s fitness. But oddly enough in humans, too much trauma will induce depersonalization and derealization, which impairs your ability to consolidate new memories. After my symbolic death occurred, I developed just such \u201cdisorders\u201d (which are very poorly understood and rare) and took many trials with medications to remedy. Castaneda claims that you cannot easily recollect memories stored during heightened awareness and mostly can only be done by entering heightened awareness again. The psychiatry field claims DP/DR is a protection mechanism, but why?\nThis could be because remembering too much traumatic experiences impairs the brain\u2019s ability to function and can lead to PTSD disorder. Humans didn\u2019t evolve into computers, we evolved from simple organisms that survive by using fight or flight mechanisms. Stanely Kubrick\u2019s _A Clockwork Orange_ was a seminal film where Alex, the leader of a brutal gang called the \u201cdroogs\u201d, is subjected to watch nonstop streams of short violent clips while pumped full of drugs, in many repeated trials while in isolation, so that he will develop a \u201cgag\u201d response to any form of violence.\nThis demonstrates how DP/DR works, since your brain cannot manufacture new neurotransmitters, it simply shuts down the whole memory consolidation process altogether and dissociates you from your past memories. Thus your ego becomes compartmentalized by your Id because your ego failed to satisfy its needs. What this means is that you ego is indeed a fabrication and two that your Id (dark passenger) wipes the slate clean for a new ego to form. If a human undergoes this process too many times it may lead to serious dissociative identity disorder.\nSo what happens in between egos then? From personal experience, it\u2019s a hellscape where you live in a dilated five minute window and no longer identify with your past memories, past ego, others (including family/friends), culture, and even reality itself. Your basic perceptual input such as sight and sound become distorted and fielded such that you derive pleasure from only the most basic needs of your Id. You become chronically anxious, depressed, and scared shitless. Sleep becomes your one and only reprieve. If you remain in isolation, you may never form a new ego or recover your previous one, and may develop psychosis.\nSo why would anyone willingly subject themselves to DP/DR disorder? The reason is the most ignored yet salient symptom: an uncanny heightened sense of awareness. Talking from personal experience, you can modulate at will this sense so easily that your only limit is the level of existential crisis you can handle. You become painfully aware of your self and your surroundings. This makes sense from a psychology perspective because otherwise you might not make observations different from your former ego. Most cases of DP/DR resolve themselves sooner rather than later depending on the emotional trauma you suffered. In my case, I had voluminous trauma as a child, and the isolation I subjected myself to was the nail in the coffin. I will never recover from my symbolic death, and didn\u2019t intentionally ask for it, but it was something that long ago I cried out for, and you could say that perhaps the Abstract heard that cry of silence.\n# Psychiatry\nThis a field I know well but not formally, but through trial and error. After my symbolic death, I soon began to navigate the psychiatry industry, as I lacked a benefactor. What I found out were many \u201claws\u201d that I collectively call the _Psycho Pass Laws_.\n## The Psycho-Pass Laws\n- **The Industry Laws:**\n\t1. Hospitals and clinics, not doctors, are afraid of lawsuits, so avoid them at all costs.\n\t2. The Hippocratic oath is a two way street between doctor and patient.\n\t3. All doctors are in the business to make money, but not necessarily _for_ the money.\n\t4. Most medical doctors are visited daily by pharmaceutical representatives.\n\t5. Doctors cannot disclose your data nor can they keep it.\n\t6. Be a friend, not a customer.\n\t7. Buy the best health insurance you can afford.\n\t8. Your doctor has other patients, so be patient.\n\t9. Doctors prescribe, psychologists talk.\n\t10. Doctors specialize in specializing.\n- **The House Laws:**\n\t1. You can\u2019t always get what you want, but you can get what you need.\n\t2. Everybody lies.\n\t3. Everybody dies.\n\t4. **Only experimentation cures patients**.\n- **The Unspoken Laws:**\n\t1. The Costanza Law: It\u2019s not a lie, if you believe it.\n\t2. The Catch 22 Law: Talking about your symptoms makes them worse.\n\t3. You can fire a doctor in America.\n\t4. Don\u2019t believe everything you read and vice versa.\n\t5. The patient becomes the doctor.\n\t6. The truth is stranger than fiction.\n- **The Common Sense Laws:**\n\t1. Sleep more hours than you work.\n\t2. What\u2019s useful for some isn\u2019t always useful to others.\n\t3. Measure twice, cut once.\n\t4. Never throw out a pharmaceutical drug.\n\t5. What is dead, may never die.\n\t6. If something doesn\u2019t work a first time, it won\u2019t work a second time.\n\t7. Doctors who don\u2019t value your time aren\u2019t worth your money.\n- **The Four Moods Laws**\n\t1. Ruthlessness should not be harsh.\n\t2. Cunning should not be cruelty.\n\t3. Patience should not be negligence.\n\t4. Sweetness should not be foolishness.\n# Psycho-Pass: A Human Suit\n## Hunter x Hunter\nWhen you symbolically die your ego dies along with it. You\u2019ll find yourself in a world you are not prepared to live in, like living on a planet without oxygen. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have a benefactor you won\u2019t need a synthetic human suit or a Psycho-Pass cocktail as I call it. But most of us don\u2019t have benefactors like DJ was to Carlos, and even then you\u2019ll find yourself with a long walk to take. If you don\u2019t go mad first, you\u2019ll find yourself doing just as Carlos discussed, first the path to becoming a hunter, where you savagely learn through trial and error how to survive in your new world. Personally, my days as a hunter was learning the Psycho-Pass laws and learning the art of stalking to pick the pharmaceutical berries for my human suit to be.\nMany years unfolded until I learned what Carlos meant when he talked about the art of being a warrior. If you manage to become a hunter you find yourself engaging in war to reconcile the world of the known and unknown. You\u2019ll learn how deception works and the importance of discipline\u2014much like a game of chess\u2014except the stakes are higher and if you\u2019re lucky you win the clarity necessary to become a sorcerer. As a sorcerer you\u2019ll know things without having to reason about them, but the first step that must be taken is to \u201cspin with an ally\u201d\u2014when you\u2019re ready the ally will find you most likely. When will you know you\u2019ve transitioned from one one stage to another? It\u2019s hard to know and that\u2019s why walking the path is different than knowing the path.\nThe Psycho-Pass cocktail isn\u2019t something I recommend if you can avoid it, but you must find a way to balance the two worlds you\u2019ll find yourself lost between. If you can\u2019t find a way to mask your ruthlessness and indifference to people it\u2019s sort of hard to keep a job down if your employer thinks you\u2019re a psychopath or had a mental breakdown. The cocktail is not recreational and should be used with extreme caution. The Psycho-Pass cocktail is a _human suit_ not a toy; it exists only to fabricate an ego or identity complex to _pass_ as human and not a sorcerer\u2014it\u2019s simply an interim mask you wear and never should you let it wear you.\n## The Human Suit Cocktail\n### Words of Wisdom\nIf you decide to embark on the long journey to develop your own human suit, before you do anything, dish out $200-300 on a time release safe and give the override keys to someone you trust enough to hide forever. Program the safe to open only once a day between a two hour time window each day of the week that you may access your cocktail using a passcode. This is a necessary precaution to ensure that you don\u2019t fall prey to your human suit\u2014at no time should you ever take more than prescribed\u2014not only because it\u2019s dangerous but the odds of forming an addiction will be much higher.\n### Clonazepam\nClonazepam was the first medication I experimented with and is very effective for treating depersonalization and derealization for those whom have just undergone a symbolic death. Clonazepam is one of few benzodiazepines that can be taken long term without too many undesirable side effects. As I mentioned before, after symbolic death your memory consolidation will be shutdown, so it\u2019s really no concern that taking a benzodiazepine like Clonazepam will affect your memory\u2014in fact it actually will improve it post symbolic death.\nClonazepam will reach maximum efficacy at 1 mg but one should try taking much less than this first. You can go 24 hours without serious withdrawal or life threatening side effects such as seizures. Clonazepam is available from many generic manufacturers and with the proper health insurance is cheap. 1 mg Clonazepam retains its efficacy for at least 10 years but that\u2019s as far as my data goes, so I can\u2019t say after that whether a dosage increase will be required.\n### Atomoxetine\nAtomoxetine is by far the most interesting medication in the cocktail I take. Like Alex from _A Clockwork Orange_ you\u2019ll develop a gag post symbolic death. This gag is the result of an Id that is unmasked and you\u2019ll literally hear its unexpected commentary that will be more or less word salad. Your Id will gag at many things that disturb it, which will depend on the individual.\nI discovered Atomoxetine through many failed trials with SSRIs that should never have been prescribed to me\u2014which are no more effective than placebo. I discovered that Effexor, which is a mild Norepinephrine repuptake inhibitor, slightly reduced my gag reflex, which lead me to Atomoxetine which is the best selective NRI medication on the market.\nAtomoxetine has a reputation for pooping out quickly, which is why you\u2019ll likely end up taking 100 mg, the maximum dosage. However, at 100 mg Atomoxetine works miracles for controlling any sort of mental \u201cgag\u201d reflex. You can safely stop Atomoxetine at any time without major withdrawal symptoms.\n### Vyvanse\nVyvanse is an amphetamine commonly used for ADHD and among others comes highly recommend among patients whom take it for the disorder. Post symbolic death you\u2019ll likely have anhedonia and will need to supplement to increase your dopamine levels to function properly. Personally I had heard all the misinformation about how dangerous and addictive amphetamines are and didn\u2019t try them immediately. When I did finally give them a try I found that my brain\u2019s plasticity became outrageously high and felt like it took 10 years off the age of my brain. Vyvanse, like Gabapentin, is very useful for opening the gate to intent.\nVyvanse compared to Adderall or Ritalin is much safer in terms of stress on your body and neurotoxicity and is more selective and lasts the longest among the three. You can expect with all ADHD drugs to quickly form a tolerance to them, so odds are you\u2019ll find yourself at 70 mg sooner or later. You can safely stop Vyvanse at any time without major withdrawal symptoms.\n### Gabapentin and Zolfran\nGabapentin, like Clonazepam, is a GABA drug, which means your mental frequency will be be lowered while on either of them. Gabapentin is most commonly used for chronic pain patients but also is used off label for anxiety. I discovered that Gabapentin, at 1200+ mg will invoke the four moods of stalking almost perfectly, which makes opening the gate to intent effortless.\nGabapentin is not part of my daily cocktail, I only take it when I decide to, which  makes it different from the others on this list because it\u2019s not actually part of my human suit.\nGabapentin is a very safe drug and is hard to overdose because it\u2019s eliminated through your renal system and so your liver doesn\u2019t take a major hit. Gabapentin can be stopped at any time safely without major withdrawal symptoms. I take Zolfran with Gabapentin because it tends to make many people slightly nauseous at higher doses.\n### Zyprexa\nZyprexa is the devil in disguise but can be life saving in terms of stabilizing after a symbolic death\u2014so only take it for no longer than a month. Zyprexa is an antipsychotic and is usually prescribed when a psychiatrist has no idea what\u2019s wrong with you, and so is often wrongfully prescribed. The only case where I recommend taking it on a daily basis is if you start to exhibit signs of paranoia\u2014which is a big red flag that almost always suggests psychosis. Once you become psychotic, there\u2019s no return\u2014you\u2019re a goner\u2014which is why I take it daily as a purely precautionary measure.\nShould you take Zyprexa daily expect to gain 100 pounds (seriously) and expect to be chronically fatigued. This is another reason why Vyvanse is in my cocktail, which offsets both Zyprexa and Clonazepam\u2019s tendency to make you fall asleep. Honestly though, I recommend taking some of the newer antipsychotics on the market instead of Zyprexa should you decide to play things safe, but since I haven\u2019t tried any of them, I cannot really discuss them.\n### CBD\nIf you\u2019ve been alive for the past few years you\u2019ve probably heard of Cannabidiol. CBD is a recent addition to my cocktail because not only is it a safe neuro-protective agent but it\u2019s also an apoptosis agent that fights cancer. Other than that, CBD is probably the best way to induce the second attention without the danger of psychosis like THC has been known to provoke for those at risk for mental illness--in fact CBD is an antipsychotic agent. CBD is the only compound in the Psycho-Pass cocktail that has potential for inducing the second attention and lucidity, but I can\u2019t say so with 100% confidence since I\u2019m still experimenting with it.\nCBD is legal in most states in the U.S now. I highly recommend dishing out for a quality vape pen unless you want your lungs to fail from vitamin E poisoning\u2014but CBD pills are also widely available without a prescription. CBD is definitely an interesting place to start if you have no need for an actual human suit and perhaps is the only compound I would recommend taking if that\u2019s the case.\n### Milk Thistle\nI take Milk Thistle daily because I have the hardest working liver in the galaxy, but I would recommend it irregardless, especially if you drink alcohol regularly. I also recommend Hi-Lyte electrolyte supplements and plenty of water in that regard as well.\n# Conclusion\nA quote I remember most from Psycho-Pass the anime was by Shogo Makishima the psychopath: _\u201dEveryone is alone. Everyone is empty. People no longer have need of others. You can always find a spare for any talent. Any relationship can be replaced.\u201d_. I once met an oddly intelligent old man whom made my subway sandwiches for about a year before he disappeared. He had two names and had married and divorced 11 wives and wrote a book about it. He was a wealthy man with many talents and simply worked at subway because it occupied his mind or perhaps out of loneliness. Right before he left he gave me a free copy of his book and I read it. That was the day I realized that true sobriety is criminal in this day and age. The war a sorcerer fights is ultimately for clarity above all else and while many people use drugs to escape sobriety, a sorcerer uses them to find it in world gone mad with reason.\nI wrote this post for Cholita in mind.

You\u2019ll learn how deception works and the importance of discipline\u2014much like a game of chess\u2014except the stakes are higher and if you\u2019re lucky you win the clarity necessary to become a sorcerer. As a sorcerer you\u2019ll know things without having to reason about them, but the first step that must be taken is to \u201cspin with an ally\u201d\u2014when you\u2019re ready the ally will find you most likely. When will you know you\u2019ve transitioned from one one stage to another? It\u2019s hard to know and that\u2019s why walking the path is different than knowing the path.\nThe Psycho-Pass cocktail isn\u2019t something I recommend if you can avoid it, but you must find a way to balance the two worlds you\u2019ll find yourself lost between. If you can\u2019t find a way to mask your ruthlessness and indifference to people it\u2019s sort of hard to keep a job down if your employer thinks you\u2019re a psychopath or had a mental breakdown. The cocktail is not recreational and should be used with extreme caution. The Psycho-Pass cocktail is a &lt;em&gt;human suit&lt;/em&gt; not a toy; it exists only to fabricate an ego or identity complex to &lt;em&gt;pass&lt;/em&gt; as human and not a sorcerer\u2014it\u2019s simply an interim mask you wear and never should you let it wear you.\n## The Human Suit Cocktail\n### Words of Wisdom\nIf you decide to embark on the long journey to develop your own human suit, before you do anything, dish out $200-300 on a time release safe and give the override keys to someone you trust enough to hide forever. Program the safe to open only once a day between a two hour time window each day of the week that you may access your cocktail using a passcode. This is a necessary precaution to ensure that you don\u2019t fall prey to your human suit\u2014at no time should you ever take more than prescribed\u2014not only because it\u2019s dangerous but the odds of forming an addiction will be much higher.\n### Clonazepam\nClonazepam was the first medication I experimented with and is very effective for treating depersonalization and derealization for those whom have just undergone a symbolic death. Clonazepam is one of few benzodiazepines that can be taken long term without too many undesirable side effects. As I mentioned before, after symbolic death your memory consolidation will be shutdown, so it\u2019s really no concern that taking a benzodiazepine like Clonazepam will affect your memory\u2014in fact it actually will improve it post symbolic death.\nClonazepam will reach maximum efficacy at 1 mg but one should try taking much less than this first. You can go 24 hours without serious withdrawal or life threatening side effects such as seizures. Clonazepam is available from many generic manufacturers and with the proper health insurance is cheap. 1 mg Clonazepam retains its efficacy for at least 10 years but that\u2019s as far as my data goes, so I can\u2019t say after that whether a dosage increase will be required.\n### Atomoxetine\nAtomoxetine is by far the most interesting medication in the cocktail I take. Like Alex from &lt;em&gt;A Clockwork Orange&lt;/em&gt; you\u2019ll develop a gag post symbolic death. This gag is the result of an Id that is unmasked and you\u2019ll literally hear its unexpected commentary that will be more or less word salad. Your Id will gag at many things that disturb it, which will depend on the individual.\nI discovered Atomoxetine through many failed trials with SSRIs that should never have been prescribed to me\u2014which are no more effective than placebo. I discovered that Effexor, which is a mild Norepinephrine repuptake inhibitor, slightly reduced my gag reflex, which lead me to Atomoxetine which is the best selective NRI medication on the market.\nAtomoxetine has a reputation for pooping out quickly, which is why you\u2019ll likely end up taking 100 mg, the maximum dosage. However, at 100 mg Atomoxetine works miracles for controlling any sort of mental \u201cgag\u201d reflex. You can safely stop Atomoxetine at any time without major withdrawal symptoms.\n### Vyvanse\nVyvanse is an amphetamine commonly used for ADHD and among others comes highly recommend among patients whom take it for the disorder. Post symbolic death you\u2019ll likely have anhedonia and will need to supplement to increase your dopamine levels to function properly. Personally I had heard all the misinformation about how dangerous and addictive amphetamines are and didn\u2019t try them immediately. When I did finally give them a try I found that my brain\u2019s plasticity became outrageously high and felt like it took 10 years off the age of my brain. Vyvanse, like Gabapentin, is very useful for opening the gate to intent.\nVyvanse compared to Adderall or Ritalin is much safer in terms of stress on your body and neurotoxicity and is more selective and lasts the longest among the three. You can expect with all ADHD drugs to quickly form a tolerance to them, so odds are you\u2019ll find yourself at 70 mg sooner or later. You can safely stop Vyvanse at any time without major withdrawal symptoms.\n### Gabapentin and Zolfran\nGabapentin, like Clonazepam, is a GABA drug, which means your mental frequency will be be lowered while on either of them. Gabapentin is most commonly used for chronic pain patients but also is used off label for anxiety. I discovered that Gabapentin, at 1200+ mg will invoke the four moods of stalking almost perfectly, which makes opening the gate to intent effortless.\nGabapentin is not part of my daily cocktail, I only take it when I decide to, which  makes it different from the others on this list because it\u2019s not actually part of my human suit.\nGabapentin is a very safe drug and is hard to overdose because it\u2019s eliminated through your renal system and so your liver doesn\u2019t take a major hit. Gabapentin can be stopped at any time safely without major withdrawal symptoms. I take Zolfran with Gabapentin because it tends to make many people slightly nauseous at higher doses.\n### Zyprexa\nZyprexa is the devil in disguise but can be life saving in terms of stabilizing after a symbolic death\u2014so only take it for no longer than a month. Zyprexa is an antipsychotic and is usually prescribed when a psychiatrist has no idea what\u2019s wrong with you, and so is often wrongfully prescribed. The only case where I recommend taking it on a daily basis is if you start to exhibit signs of paranoia\u2014which is a big red flag that almost always suggests psychosis. Once you become psychotic, there\u2019s no return\u2014you\u2019re a goner\u2014which is why I take it daily as a purely precautionary measure.\nShould you take Zyprexa daily expect to gain 100 pounds (seriously) and expect to be chronically fatigued. This is another reason why Vyvanse is in my cocktail, which offsets both Zyprexa and Clonazepam\u2019s tendency to make you fall asleep. Honestly though, I recommend taking some of the newer antipsychotics on the market instead of Zyprexa should you decide to play things safe, but since I haven\u2019t tried any of them, I cannot really discuss them.\n### CBD\nIf you\u2019ve been alive for the past few years you\u2019ve probably heard of Cannabidiol. CBD is a recent addition to my cocktail because not only is it a safe neuro-protective agent but it\u2019s also an apoptosis agent that fights cancer. Other than that, CBD is probably the best way to induce the second attention without the danger of psychosis like THC has been known to provoke for those at risk for mental illness--in fact CBD is an antipsychotic agent. CBD is the only compound in the Psycho-Pass cocktail that has potential for inducing the second attention and lucidity, but I can\u2019t say so with 100% confidence since I\u2019m still experimenting with it.\nCBD is legal in most states in the U.S now. I highly recommend dishing out for a quality vape pen unless you want your lungs to fail from vitamin E poisoning\u2014but CBD pills are also widely available without a prescription. CBD is definitely an interesting place to start if you have no need for an actual human suit and perhaps is the only compound I would recommend taking if that\u2019s the case.\n### Milk Thistle\nI take Milk Thistle daily because I have the hardest working liver in the galaxy, but I would recommend it irregardless, especially if you drink alcohol regularly. I also recommend Hi-Lyte electrolyte supplements and plenty of water in that regard as well.\n# Conclusion\nA quote I remember most from Psycho-Pass the anime was by Shogo Makishima the psychopath: &lt;em&gt;\u201dEveryone is alone. Everyone is empty. People no longer have need of others. You can always find a spare for any talent. Any relationship can be replaced.\u201d&lt;/em&gt;. I once met an oddly intelligent old man whom made my subway sandwiches for about a year before he disappeared. He had two names and had married and divorced 11 wives and wrote a book about it. He was a wealthy man with many talents and simply worked at subway because it occupied his mind or perhaps out of loneliness. Right before he left he gave me a free copy of his book and I read it. That was the day I realized that true sobriety is criminal in this day and age. The war a sorcerer fights is ultimately for clarity above all else and while many people use drugs to escape sobriety, a sorcerer uses them to find it in world gone mad with reason.\nI wrote this post for Cholita in mind. She is lost in a poisonous sea between worlds that I know all too well; I was by chance lucky enough to have been raised by an insane witch whom taught me how to swim in it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "43d4e582-6010-11ea-a748-0ef2a7bb995d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "gr4qz5", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/gr4qz5/the_human_suit/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/gr4qz5/the_human_suit/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1590524231.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_gr4qz5", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fsc6n8a", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_frwxl8e", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "My mother is the same way, perhaps worse, so she's a \"goner\".

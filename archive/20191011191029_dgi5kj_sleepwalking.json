It seems to be a \u201ccomplete path\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve made up that term, to refer to something like Zuleica\u2019s harp playing technique, where you can pretty much learn everything in Carlos\u2019 books just by following that series of procedures.\n\nBy selecting a path like that, your tendency to put off practicing will be reduced, since you only have to resume what you were doing the night before. And it becomes more entertaining each day!\n\nIt\u2019ll actually become what you look forward to all day.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cpath with heart\u201d, because you don\u2019t feel hopeless and trapped anymore. You\u2019re learning and growing again, along the same path that was interrupted and restricted by your parents,  when you were an infant.\n\nIf you keep it up, that path will take you all the way to stopping the world and assembling new ones.\n\nPlus, you might snatch an inorganic being to play with!\n\nStill it\u2019s true that there are other complete paths in Carlos\u2019 books, besides Zuleica's.\n\nIf I hadn\u2019t been banned from reading the books of Carlos Castaneda, I might go look for another.\n\nMaybe one of you will find something promising and report on it.\n\nLike, gazing at mirrors in water, until you capture a water being. Where does that lead?\n\nGoing down a specific path, instead of just claiming you\u2019re doing \u201ceverything\u201d, being the impeccable warrior you are,  doesn\u2019t prevent you from learning what happens on other paths.\n\nZuleica\u2019s series of techniques to build the energy body seem to be very far from the path of stalking.\n\nBut it\u2019s not so! I\u2019d dare to say, dreaming practices take stalking from the realm of artificial behavior, into the realm of survival.\n\nOnce you become a dreamer, you\u2019re forced into stalking.\n\nYou just can\u2019t explain yourself to normal people.  And they often insist on accounts.\n\nPeople, \u201ccheck up\u201d on each other all the time, with the pretense of taking an interest in you.  Carlos called it, \"Renewing personal history.\"\n\nBut if you deviate even a tiny bit from the allowed activities, it\u2019ll turn out they\u2019re more interested in attacking than listening.\n\nIt\u2019s built into the fliers mind.\n\nListen compassionately for flaws, and attack when needed.\n\nI\u2019m surprised the murder rate is as low as it is.\n\nSo dreaming automatically leads to stalking.\n\nBut what can you do the rest of the day?\n\nDreaming practices seem to work best at night when the local population is asleep. It\u2019s not enough advantage to insist you have to practice then, but it does seem to make assembling other worlds a tiny bit easier. I\u2019d say 3AM to 5AM is best, but you need to start at 1AM in order to get in enough silence for dramatic results.\n\nThanks to one of you for pointing that possibility out to me.  It turns out to be somewhat true.\n\nUnfortunately, if you only practice in the middle of the night, and you live with other people, your practice time will be highly limited, and you'll miss too many days.\n\nFortunately for us as a whole, all trying to move as fast as possible, Cholita has put an end to my nighttime practices.\n\nSo I had to find an alternative. Maybe one of you will become a specialist in it.\n\nHow can you find time during the day, by mixing in the practice of a specific technique,  with what you have to do anyway?\n\nSleepwalking.\n\nTake a tip from \"the sleepwalker Genaro\".\n\nCo-existing around others while asleep isn\u2019t unique to Carlos\u2019 sorcery. Around the same location as Dance Home, where Carlos held most of his private classes, was the headquarters of a popular Guru of that period.\n\nIt was Muktananda.   I dare say there were more than a few Los Angeles followers of Carlos who turned to Muktananda, because they had no access to Carlos.\n\nMuktananda wrote books about assembling other worlds, visiting heaven, but especially interesting to me was his own teacher.\n\nHis teacher was a sleep walker. Or sleep lecturer.  Or chair sleeper while actually awake.\n\nI\u2019m not sure of the extent of his ability.\n\nHe\u2019d sit on his yogi thrown, fully asleep, and mumble answers to questions when he had no choice.\n\nMuch of the time he could be heard snoring.\n\nBy the way, Muktananda was also a fan of those blue dots.  The ones I'm starting to suspect, are effect before cause.\n\nThere\u2019s also Morihei Ueshiba, although I\u2019m not sure you can read about his sleepwalking.\n\nI learned about it from stories told by his contemporaries, like Richard Kim.\n\nHe was sort of like the movie and TV character, Zatoichi.\n\nYou could try to sneak up on him while he was asleep, but it usually turned out that he hadn\u2019t lost consciousness and could thwart any attack.\n\nIt\u2019s actually a wonderful feeling, not to lose consciousness when asleep. The second attention mixes in with your normal perceptions, and the world becomes a little more magical. Sounds tinkle and sensations produce miniature waves of pleasure on the skin.\n\nBeing asleep, the internal dialogue is all but gone. If you think about an image, you get echoes of it in ever mutating forms.\n\nSo how can you learn sleep walking?\n\nGet yourself a Cholita.\n\nFind the most angry, hateful, impossible to get along with person, and make them fully dependent on you for their very life.\n\nYou want to be stuck with them every second, and needing to follow them around just feet away for hours each day.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s a kind of an extreme thing to do. But it\u2019s not out of line with Carlos\u2019 books. There are a couple of occasions when Carlos writes about the benefit of taking care of another sorcerer, who\u2019s not quite right.\n\nAnd the Zen people love to torture monks into enlightenment, by making their lives so awful that they can only survive in a meditative state.\n\nI won\u2019t go into the details of living with Cholita, because they\u2019re pretty awful. But the only way to survive around her is to remain asleep as much as possible.  Then her insults just blow right through you, and you get an inkling of what she's really saying and thinking.\n\nAnd it's not what your internal dialogue would have noticed.\n\nThere are some side effects. That\u2019s what I wanted to warn you about.\n\nIt\u2019ll speed things up, and make it easier to figure out when you\u2019re doing well, if I pass on my lame tips.\n\nAt first you won\u2019t realize you\u2019ve succeeded in sleep walking. You need time to notice what it feels like.  It'll progress so slowly, you won't detect it.\n\nFirst, if you\u2019re sleep walking for a few hours and then have to speak to someone, because it\u2019s unavoidable, don\u2019t speak right away.\n\nClear your throat, like you had to cough for a bit.\n\nIf you try to speak, you\u2019ll be surprised to find that your mouth doesn\u2019t work very well.  So cough lightly,  get your vocal cords to vibrate a bit, put your hand up to your mouth and rub it as if considering what to say, and then maybe you can speak.\n\nAlso, perhaps try to recite a list from memory, in your head.  Before you speak.  A grocery list is fine.\n\nNot only does your mouth stop functioning correctly, but your sense of reality is a bit scrambled. Thinking of something ordinary which taxes the memory helps to move the assemblage point to a better place for conversation.\n\nIf you don\u2019t do that, you\u2019ll sound extremely drunk for 15 or 20 seconds.   But it'll wear off, and you'll be even more lucid and talkative than normal.\n\nPeople will think you had a mini-stroke, but recovered very well.\n\nI learned about this, because Cholita\u2019s bad behavior often requires me to make amends for her as we wander around for hours each night.  That includes a tiny bit of vandalism, or stealing free desert and tea from a poorly guarded hotel convention.\n\nYour walking, while asleep,  will also become a bit clumsy.\n\nI recommend going to the gym, to make up for the possibility of stumbling on a speed bump in a parking lot, and jarring some joint or muscle.\n\nBest to be in somewhat good shape if you take up sleep walking.  If you really want to do a good job, pay one of the coaches who works for the gym to tutor you in how to get in shape for sleep walking.\n\nI'm not completely joking.  *Intent* will notice something like that.\n\nOne of the first things you might observe is that while sleep walking, the steps of the people around you, and indeed your own steps, become very noticeable. Your awareness of your surroundings gets more expansive, because you aren't limited by your internal dialogue.  You hear a constant flow of tapping noises from high heels, flip flops, and indeed your own muffled steps, which seem to echo in your ear as if it were clogged by a head cold.\n\nDriving is a problem. I haven\u2019t figured out the balance between driving in silence, and slumping over at the wheel because you went a bit too far and your body nodded off due to inactivity.\n\nIn fact, keep moving is the best advice. If you stop for a minute, maybe to sit, you\u2019re likely to discover you were a lot more asleep than you realized.\n\nI once sat up on my bed after a 3 hour solo sleepwalking marathon, turned on the TV, watched a bit, and then found my head slumping forward, almost violently.\n\nI raised it back up, but it slumped forward in just a few seconds.  People who've practiced a lot of meditation or forced silence in a chair will be familiar with that slump.\n\nIt's why Carlos created the \"silence stick\" technique.\n\nAfter the third slump, I realized that I was sound asleep!  But I could still listen to the TV.\n\nAt the time when you\u2019re first learning to sleep walk it just feels normal. You get there slowly, so you don\u2019t notice it.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re submerged in an invisible fog, which dampens all sensory input.\n\nOr all concerns. I\u2019m not sure which gets dampened.\n\nThe hue of the environment also takes on a yellow or orangeish tint.\n\nBut how do you learn sleep walking?\n\nTry to achieve the same level of silence as you can with Zuleica\u2019s scooping technique.  You probably won\u2019t have any luck finding colors in the darkness, without some level of silence (except maybe the women). So you\u2019ll already be familiar with what to do, to fall asleep while awake.\n\nThat\u2019s what heightened awareness is!\n\nBut to make the colors you find in darkness fully \u201cdirectional\u201d, meaning they stay where you put them, you need very deep silence.\n\nThat\u2019s also all you need for sleep walking.\n\nExcept that you have to achieve it with all the commotion of being out in public, possibly on a household buying spree. And that takes your silence into an entirely different realm.\n\nAlso, you won't have (at first), the advantage of looking at something coming from the second attention.  So it'll be harder to keep it up.\n\nThat just means, you'll build bigger \"silence muscles\".\n\nRemember this:  When you're having a hell of a time getting silent, and you feel like a total failure, but you keep trying anyway...\n\nThat's when you make the most progress.  It'll show the next day.\n\nFor example, as a result of last night's sleepwalking, I had my head nod off while proof reading this post.  I was partially asleep the whole time I wrote it!\n\nLast night Cholita decided that all of my kitchen stuff had to go.  Spoons, forks, knives, plates, cups, dish holders.\n\nEven the microwave. It all had to be thrown out, along with most of the rest of my belongings.\n\n\u201cThat microwave is the best you can get;  it\u2019s ***analog***!\u201d, I warned Cholita,  like a true nerd.\n\nShe gave me a small but angry glance, letting me know I wouldn\u2019t prevail. It has to go because it has unknown germs.\n\nShe has to put up with me, but who knows what kind of women I\u2019ve had in my home, before she came along.\n\n(None)\n\nWe wandered around at Bed, Bath, and Beyond \u201cInternational\u201d, stuffing 3 shopping carts with colorful imported dishes and cups, weird utensils, a Buddha statue, and far too many pillows.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with women and pillows?\n\nNot that I\u2019m complaining...\n\nThey finally had to throw us out of the store. Cholita kept going back for more, while I was paying for the last haul.\n\nI came up with a joke that day, but it's only funny to older people.\n\nCholita is like Columbo.  There's always \"one more thing\".\n\nI was sleep walking nearly the entire time, until I had to pay and couldn\u2019t avoid talking to someone.\n\nThen I slept while driving home, with Cholita chattering away, keeping me from slumping over.  If she didn't chatter like that, I couldn't practice sleepdriving.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to exist at Cholita\u2019s position of the assemblage point as much as possible, but it moves around so it\u2019s difficult.\n\nAnd last night I really screwed up.\n\nShe wanted to ask me a serious question. She said it was sincere, and she wanted an honest answer.\n\nI shook myself awake.\n\nCholita is used to that kind of craziness from me, and maybe doesn\u2019t even notice.\n\nShe asked, since I\u2019ve been watching her every move since Carlos put us together more than 20 years ago, \u201cfrom a distance\u201d, why did I create so much homelessness, and why did I want to turn her into a military recruit who has to save the world?\n\nDo I want her to be the virgin sacrifice for all of humanity, and live alone forever?  And what about my sorcerer friends on the internet?  What sort of ugly plan to save humanity have they created?\n\nI screwed up and missed a good opportunity.\n\nI whined, \u201cWhaaattttt??????\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cNever mind, forget I said anything at all.\u201d\n\nI felt bad and pleaded with her to try the question again.\n\nNope. She wouldn\u2019t do it.  She turned the car heater up to full, put her legs up on the dash, turned up the radio, and opened her window so that I couldn\u2019t hear her even if she chose to speak.\n\nThat gave me another good reason to go back to sleep, but I felt quite bad about it.\n\nShe made up for it later.\n\nAfter I carried all the packages into what I\u2019ve dubbed, \u201cthe blue room\u201d, across from her \"pink bedroom\", so that they were out of the way but Cholita knew where to find everything (she loses stuff), I went to watch the TV news for a bit.\n\nWhen I emerged to see if Cholita was still alive and maybe in a better mood, I found her singing in the kitchen.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe what I saw.\n\nIt was a \u201cMexican Kitchen\u201d.\n\nI can\u2019t quite describe what was different, but everything about the changes she made caused me to realize, she was just trying to produce the environment in which she felt most comfortable.\n\nAnd the singing was the result.\n\nBut she'll still hate me tonight when I get home from work.\n\nLately her thing is that I'm a pathetic looser who needs to get a girlfriend and have an active sex life, so that I can salvage what's left of it.\n\nMy usual reply is, \"But I have you.\"\n\n\"No, you don't! \"\n\nShe's fond of pointing that out.\n\nEdited: four times", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sleepwalking", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Misc.

That includes a tiny bit of vandalism, or stealing free desert and tea from a poorly guarded hotel convention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your walking, while asleep,  will also become a bit clumsy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recommend going to the gym, to make up for the possibility of stumbling on a speed bump in a parking lot, and jarring some joint or muscle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best to be in somewhat good shape if you take up sleep walking.  If you really want to do a good job, pay one of the coaches who works for the gym to tutor you in how to get in shape for sleep walking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not completely joking.  &lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; will notice something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the first things you might observe is that while sleep walking, the steps of the people around you, and indeed your own steps, become very noticeable. Your awareness of your surroundings gets more expansive, because you aren&amp;#39;t limited by your internal dialogue.  You hear a constant flow of tapping noises from high heels, flip flops, and indeed your own muffled steps, which seem to echo in your ear as if it were clogged by a head cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Driving is a problem. I haven\u2019t figured out the balance between driving in silence, and slumping over at the wheel because you went a bit too far and your body nodded off due to inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, keep moving is the best advice. If you stop for a minute, maybe to sit, you\u2019re likely to discover you were a lot more asleep than you realized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once sat up on my bed after a 3 hour solo sleepwalking marathon, turned on the TV, watched a bit, and then found my head slumping forward, almost violently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I raised it back up, but it slumped forward in just a few seconds.  People who&amp;#39;ve practiced a lot of meditation or forced silence in a chair will be familiar with that slump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why Carlos created the &amp;quot;silence stick&amp;quot; technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the third slump, I realized that I was sound asleep!  But I could still listen to the TV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the time when you\u2019re first learning to sleep walk it just feels normal. You get there slowly, so you don\u2019t notice it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re submerged in an invisible fog, which dampens all sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or all concerns. I\u2019m not sure which gets dampened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hue of the environment also takes on a yellow or orangeish tint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how do you learn sleep walking?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to achieve the same level of silence as you can with Zuleica\u2019s scooping technique.  You probably won\u2019t have any luck finding colors in the darkness, without some level of silence (except maybe the women). So you\u2019ll already be familiar with what to do, to fall asleep while awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s what heightened awareness is!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to make the colors you find in darkness fully \u201cdirectional\u201d, meaning they stay where you put them, you need very deep silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s also all you need for sleep walking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that you have to achieve it with all the commotion of being out in public, possibly on a household buying spree. And that takes your silence into an entirely different realm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, you won&amp;#39;t have (at first), the advantage of looking at something coming from the second attention.  So it&amp;#39;ll be harder to keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That just means, you&amp;#39;ll build bigger &amp;quot;silence muscles&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember this:  When you&amp;#39;re having a hell of a time getting silent, and you feel like a total failure, but you keep trying anyway...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when you make the most progress.  It&amp;#39;ll show the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, as a result of last night&amp;#39;s sleepwalking, I had my head nod off while proof reading this post.  I was partially asleep the whole time I wrote it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night Cholita decided that all of my kitchen stuff had to go.  Spoons, forks, knives, plates, cups, dish holders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even the microwave. It all had to be thrown out, along with most of the rest of my belongings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThat microwave is the best you can get;  it\u2019s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;analog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;!\u201d, I warned Cholita,  like a true nerd.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She gave me a small but angry glance, letting me know I wouldn\u2019t prevail. It has to go because it has unknown germs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has to put up with me, but who knows what kind of women I\u2019ve had in my home, before she came along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(None)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We wandered around at Bed, Bath, and Beyond \u201cInternational\u201d, stuffing 3 shopping carts with colorful imported dishes and cups, weird utensils, a Buddha statue, and far too many pillows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s up with women and pillows?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not that I\u2019m complaining...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They finally had to throw us out of the store. Cholita kept going back for more, while I was paying for the last haul.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came up with a joke that day, but it&amp;#39;s only funny to older people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is like Columbo.  There&amp;#39;s always &amp;quot;one more thing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was sleep walking nearly the entire time, until I had to pay and couldn\u2019t avoid talking to someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I slept while driving home, with Cholita chattering away, keeping me from slumping over.  If she didn&amp;#39;t chatter like that, I couldn&amp;#39;t practice sleepdriving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been trying to exist at Cholita\u2019s position of the assemblage point as much as possible, but it moves around so it\u2019s difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And last night I really screwed up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wanted to ask me a serious question. She said it was sincere, and she wanted an honest answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shook myself awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is used to that kind of craziness from me, and maybe doesn\u2019t even notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She asked, since I\u2019ve been watching her every move since Carlos put us together more than 20 years ago, \u201cfrom a distance\u201d, why did I create so much homelessness, and why did I want to turn her into a military recruit who has to save the world?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I want her to be the virgin sacrifice for all of humanity, and live alone forever?  And what about my sorcerer friends on the internet?  What sort of ugly plan to save humanity have they created?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I screwed up and missed a good opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I whined, \u201cWhaaattttt??????\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, \u201cNever mind, forget I said anything at all.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt bad and pleaded with her to try the question again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope. She wouldn\u2019t do it.  She turned the car heater up to full, put her legs up on the dash, turned up the radio, and opened her window so that I couldn\u2019t hear her even if she chose to speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gave me another good reason to go back to sleep, but I felt quite bad about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She made up for it later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I carried all the packages into what I\u2019ve dubbed, \u201cthe blue room\u201d, across from her &amp;quot;pink bedroom&amp;quot;, so that they were out of the way but Cholita knew where to find everything (she loses stuff), I went to watch the TV news for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I emerged to see if Cholita was still alive and maybe in a better mood, I found her singing in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t believe what I saw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a \u201cMexican Kitchen\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t quite describe what was different, but everything about the changes she made caused me to realize, she was just trying to produce the environment in which she felt most comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the singing was the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she&amp;#39;ll still hate me tonight when I get home from work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lately her thing is that I&amp;#39;m a pathetic looser who needs to get a girlfriend and have an active sex life, so that I can salvage what&amp;#39;s left of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My usual reply is, &amp;quot;But I have you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, you don&amp;#39;t! &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s fond of pointing that out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited: four times&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "fd91a8a8-6005-11ea-8439-0eaf9c4c470b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "dgi5kj", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 22, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/dgi5kj/sleepwalking/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/dgi5kj/sleepwalking/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1570813829.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_dgi5kj", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "icmlc0q", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_icm77fd", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Of course, over and over.

I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s put in the kind of practice time I have.  Like 6 hours a day for very long periods,  and a minimum of 2 hours when I was being lazy.\n\nExcept Cholita. Apparently she's put in nearly the same amount of time as me, but in a very disorganized manner.  She doesn't want to give up her \"discoveries\", and practices them everyday once she's acquired them.\n\nI have a new theory on why Cholita is with me now. Carlos noticed that the two of us were a little off, meaning, it was hard for both of us to get along with other people.  Different reasons, but one thing was common. We were fixated on learning more, because our social lives weren't that great.\n\nWe weren't trying to get human rewards.  We both took his books far too seriously. \n\nWe were simply committed, and nothing was going to change that.\n\nI dare to say that the others in the class had ulterior motives of all sorts.  Book deals, place to live, kiss ass up to Carlos to feel important, etc.\n\nCholita and I bought into it enough that Carlos should have seen, we wouldn't stop. Ever.\n\nCarlos even tested Cholita for a full year, by denying her classes, while she worked ordinary jobs. I guess he wanted to know if she was reliable, despite being an angry firecracker.\n\nWe also both went through a period where we accepted that Carlos was a fake, following his death, but practiced anyway. We used to argue about it, perhaps 15 years ago.\n\nWe make a good team for teaching.  Cholita isn't afraid to tell me I'm wrong, and an idiot.  And I'm not too sure of myself to ignore what she says.\n\nSo putting in that much time, in an organized and analytical fashion, and not just doing them daily like Cholita,  I found the techniques which work the fastest.\n\nIf you guys try those, and didn\u2019t do what I did before that, in terms of gaining dreaming skills, it\u2019s certainly possible that your results will be less spectacular.\n\nYou\u2019re all the guinea pigs to find out what\u2019s universal, for future people.  \n\nNot to worry!  If your results are less than spectacular, I can modify the technique for you.  \n\nAnd you will get some results no matter what. Anyone who\u2019s written to me and starts to put in real practice time, discovers cool things.\n\nAnd remember this one point. It's VERY important.   If you miss it, you'll waste a lot of time.\n\nWatching **anything** coming from the second attention, while silent, will move your assemblage point towards heightened awareness.\n\nIn heightened awareness, you don't need a teacher.  A teacher would be good, but you'll find so many things to do when you get there, that you'll only think it's a pity not to have a teacher.  Just a small pity.\n\nBut just in case my gates of dreaming obsession (and yes, I was obsessed) helped, what I did was 4 hours a day (of dreaming only) for several years.  That got me pretty much to the point of dreams inside dreams.\n\nMy technique was to force silence sitting in a chair, until I got dreaming images. And then I\u2019d enter them.\n\nI came to that emphasis because of how Carlos was teaching us in private classes. It wasn't just my idea.  He emphasized that as an entry to cool things.\n\nAnd even when I was too lazy to go sit in the chair, perhaps because it was very late at night and I needed sleep, I did the same thing laying on my side in bed.\n\nIf I woke from a dream, I lay  perfectly still forcing silence, until I went back in.  You\u2019d be surprised how fast that works, once you get over the idea that it\u2019s taking too long, and can\u2019t work.\n\nWhile in dreams, I stubbornly held onto them by spinning, jumping, grabbing dirt, killing everyone in sight (don't do that, some might be real), changing dreams by twirling, jumping into paintings, and zooming to distant objects.  To zoom, just lean in and stare at the most distant object you can find. If you don't get sucked over, you aren't staring hard enough.\n\nHowever much time you get in lucid dreaming, after you find your hands, can be renewed by changing dreams.\n\nSo typically I'd say 20 seconds is about all you get, once you find your hands and become lucid.  The act of becoming lucid makes the tonal stronger, and you wake up.\n\nIt feels like you \"ran out of energy\", and that's not a bad way to look at it.  \n\nIf you change dreams, you get the 20 seconds back.  \n\nAnd each time you do that, you get a tiny bit more. Like, 22 seconds instead of 20.  With each dream change.\n\nAnd you can change over and over, as long as the way you change dreams doesn't exceed your allotted time.\n\nEventually you can stay in dreaming as long as you like, which is when you can try to pass all of the gates of dreaming.\n\nThat's where I noticed the time differential.   Going to sleep inside a dream.\n\nYou really do span more time in less real-world time, at the 3rd level of dreams in dreams.\n\nYou can also end up bouncing around from dream to dream, trying to wake up. That can be frustrating and even a little frightening.  It\u2019s taken me as long as 2 hours to wake up, even while actively trying very hard.  I keep waking up to a copy of my room, and a copy of myself.\n\nAbout the time slow down.  It's not really that.  It seems like that, and in any way you examine it, it's true that a week in 3rd level dreaming is only about 6 hours.\n\nFor me that is. Unfortunately, so far we have no one else to tell us how long it is for them.\n\nImagine that.  Over 100 apprentices of Carlos, hundreds of classes, and no one can pipe in on the time differential they experienced. \n\nMost former private class members are still stuck on, \u201cBut he was fucking all the women!!!\u201d\n\nThe time differential may be misleading. Once you wake up,  and puzzle over the 2 weeks that went by overnight, you notice that it's more like, all the mundane stuff was left out.\n\nYou skip from significant interaction to significant interaction, and the boring stuff that usually happens in the real world is gone. \n\nLike brushing your teeth, taking out the trash, washing your hands.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t brush your teeth. But if you do, it\u2019ll end up being a significant interaction.  Something else will be added on.  It won\u2019t be your normal quick teeth brushing in the morning, that you can\u2019t even recall.\n\nBut don't let me convince anyone that's the way it HAS to be.  It\u2019s just what happened to me, mixed with a little bit of what Carlos wrote to verify it.\n\nA good example of what may be possible can be found in what happens when you try to find colors in darkness. At first you'll feel like an idiot \"scooping them\".\n\nBecause you probably won't be able to influence them at all, at first.\n\nMore likely is that you'll be able to \"pretend\" to scoop them, by putting your hand next to them, or behind them, and moving your head and hand in sync, to give the appearance of scooping.\n\n*Don\u2019t worry about it!*\n\nIt'll get real soon enough, and you might even pee your pants when it does.\n\n(I've done that more than once.)\n\nBut in my opinion, the most important thing you can learn in gates of dreaming practice is that some of those dreaming characters are a little too real.  \n\nThey return, make guest appearances, and generally give off a \"creepy\" feeling unlike anything you've run into.\n\nIt's probably \"dark energy\". It feels like that.\n\nBut I can't say for sure that's what it is, because any movement of the assemblage point potentially produces that creepy sensation.\n\nSo the beings in dreaming that give off that feeling could actually be giving off some other feeling, but it moves the assemblage point, and it feels like a scary ride at an amusement park.\n\nHere\u2019s my advice:  Do dreaming each night, but do the lazy kind where you\u2019re essentially just laying there, and anyone watching wouldn\u2019t realize you\u2019re doing the gates of dreaming.\n\nThen there\u2019s no actual time lost, and you can still schedule a little time to scoop colors in darkness.\n\nMeanwhile I have some good news. I spend more time in shared dreaming with Cholita now, than interacting in waking.\n\nShe mostly hides from me while I'm awake.\n\nBut almost as soon as I get into darkness, there's some interaction.\n\nI'm very familiar with how often I run into people I know in waking dreaming.\n\nNever. Ever.  \n\nSo it's really interesting to find Cholita right away, and each night. \n\nAnd all of the interactions are non-linear, meaning, they convey far more information than is possible in the time they took.\n\nI'm not mentioning it to Cholita, but I suspect she'll forget where things happened (waking or dreaming), and comment on something that was only in dreaming.  \n\nThat's the advantage of her insanity. No rationality.  No reason to distinguish between dreaming and waking.\n\nLast night she locked herself in her room while I replaced the door to her little garage exercise room.  She was talking continuously, with no one in there. She even started shouting, and I wondered if I should tell her to close the window, so the neighbors didn't have to hear it.\n\nSo she's perfect for incognito dreaming. As long as I don't mention it, she doesn't freak out.\n\nAnd although she hides from me, I can't help but notice that her shorts get shortier each day.\n\nEventually I'll bring the dreaming out in the open to see if she wants to actively participate.  That's the goal: Shared waking dreaming.  It should be like a stroll to the park, the way it was for Emilito.\n\nBut right now  Cholita is in really bad shape.  She can't even comment on what happened to my deodorant that was on the shelf in the bathroom.  It turns into a memory test if I ask her, and she panics if she can't remember throwing it out.\n\nIt's possible she tossed it out, because Carlos was against using normal deodorant.   Possibly because of liver cancer.  But whatever the reason, we got a lecture or two on the evils of deodorant.\n\nTom's deodorant. That was his solution.  More Whole Foods stuff.\n\nEdited: five times.", "edited": 1571245126.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f3xncio", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I doubt it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this is precisely why we need this forum!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve found some short cuts, through huge efforts.

At first you&amp;#39;ll feel like an idiot &amp;quot;scooping them&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you probably won&amp;#39;t be able to influence them at all, at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More likely is that you&amp;#39;ll be able to &amp;quot;pretend&amp;quot; to scoop them, by putting your hand next to them, or behind them, and moving your head and hand in sync, to give the appearance of scooping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don\u2019t worry about it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll get real soon enough, and you might even pee your pants when it does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;ve done that more than once.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in my opinion, the most important thing you can learn in gates of dreaming practice is that some of those dreaming characters are a little too real.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They return, make guest appearances, and generally give off a &amp;quot;creepy&amp;quot; feeling unlike anything you&amp;#39;ve run into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s probably &amp;quot;dark energy&amp;quot;. It feels like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t say for sure that&amp;#39;s what it is, because any movement of the assemblage point potentially produces that creepy sensation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the beings in dreaming that give off that feeling could actually be giving off some other feeling, but it moves the assemblage point, and it feels like a scary ride at an amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s my advice:  Do dreaming each night, but do the lazy kind where you\u2019re essentially just laying there, and anyone watching wouldn\u2019t realize you\u2019re doing the gates of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there\u2019s no actual time lost, and you can still schedule a little time to scoop colors in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I have some good news. I spend more time in shared dreaming with Cholita now, than interacting in waking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She mostly hides from me while I&amp;#39;m awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But almost as soon as I get into darkness, there&amp;#39;s some interaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very familiar with how often I run into people I know in waking dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never. Ever.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s really interesting to find Cholita right away, and each night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all of the interactions are non-linear, meaning, they convey far more information than is possible in the time they took.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not mentioning it to Cholita, but I suspect she&amp;#39;ll forget where things happened (waking or dreaming), and comment on something that was only in dreaming.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the advantage of her insanity. No rationality.  No reason to distinguish between dreaming and waking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night she locked herself in her room while I replaced the door to her little garage exercise room.  She was talking continuously, with no one in there. She even started shouting, and I wondered if I should tell her to close the window, so the neighbors didn&amp;#39;t have to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she&amp;#39;s perfect for incognito dreaming. As long as I don&amp;#39;t mention it, she doesn&amp;#39;t freak out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And although she hides from me, I can&amp;#39;t help but notice that her shorts get shortier each day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually I&amp;#39;ll bring the dreaming out in the open to see if she wants to actively participate.  That&amp;#39;s the goal: Shared waking dreaming.  It should be like a stroll to the park, the way it was for Emilito.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But right now  Cholita is in really bad shape.  She can&amp;#39;t even comment on what happened to my deodorant that was on the shelf in the bathroom.  It turns into a memory test if I ask her, and she panics if she can&amp;#39;t remember throwing it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible she tossed it out, because Carlos was against using normal deodorant.   Possibly because of liver cancer.  But whatever the reason, we got a lecture or two on the evils of deodorant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tom&amp;#39;s deodorant. That was his solution.

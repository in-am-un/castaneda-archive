What Julian did perhaps needs control over horizontal shifts, and is too difficult for a beginner.\n\nI got Fancy to materialize in full size last night,  using faces alone.  Got all dressed up and was nearly perfectly real like she used to do back in the red zone.\n\nShe even stuck her tongue out, to show me that the faces were appreciated.  Or to remind me I needed to keep doing those if I wanted her to become real looking.\n\nExcept we were in the purple zone!  I had thought you only get that quality of manifestation in the deep red zone.\n\nIn the purple zone, full on, you're surrounded by SK presentations.  In that case, it was a \"matrix\" of visible dreams in the air.\n\nIt was so thick with \"Silent Knowledge\", I wondered why don Juan would advise us to try to read text.\n\nAs if there were a shortage of things going on, and you could \"summon\" one.\n\nDoesn't seem quite right to me, but he must have had a reason for that.\n\nThe SK visions were mostly about a woman doing housework.  I couldn't figure out who she was, or if it was real, but I kept seeing her walk to the kitchen wearing an apron, then moving around in the living room, maybe cleaning the floors.\n\nThe air was \"plush\" with silent knowledge, and in the middle of the \"holes\" in the matrix of dreams Fancy was trying to become solid.\n\nAt one point I could even tell her to show me a story, like she used to do back in the good old days when I hadn't left the red zone much.\n\nShe obliged a bit, walking back where we used to play \"sock puppet\".\n\nBut I was in Silent Knowledge, and there wasn't any room in the air for her to act out a scene.\n\nAlthough I must admit, it might not have been entirely my faces made at her, giving her enough energy to do that.\n\nIt's possible she stole some energy from a witch in here.  I accidentally gave her instructions that could be interpreted two ways.  And then that witch was attacked by an ally who held her hostage for 3 hours.\n\nAnd at the precise moment she escaped, Fancy showed up with me.\n\nThe attack was a typical Fancy style activity.  Incapacitating people by showing them the abstract,  in dream form, while they inject \"reason\" when needed to reset the loop if you try to escape.\n\nI suspect that might be part of how they trap males in their world, when they didn't go there willingly.\n\nAll of your attention is focused on a very vivid dream, where it's nearly impossible to describe what's happening.\n\nThe abstract, but not 100%  Maybe only 50% abstract, and 50% dream  you can describe.\n\nAt first it'll hold you by itself, while they sit next to you on the bed.  Or float above.  But the main thing is, they want to press against your torso, maybe because of those energy pouches.\n\nWhen you realize you are trapped and try to \"wake up\", they whisper in your ear a little \"reason\", and you lash on to it, since you have none at that point.

What Julian did perhaps needs control over horizontal shifts, and is too difficult for a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got Fancy to materialize in full size last night,  using faces alone.  Got all dressed up and was nearly perfectly real like she used to do back in the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She even stuck her tongue out, to show me that the faces were appreciated.  Or to remind me I needed to keep doing those if I wanted her to become real looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except we were in the purple zone!  I had thought you only get that quality of manifestation in the deep red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the purple zone, full on, you&amp;#39;re surrounded by SK presentations.  In that case, it was a &amp;quot;matrix&amp;quot; of visible dreams in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was so thick with &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;, I wondered why don Juan would advise us to try to read text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if there were a shortage of things going on, and you could &amp;quot;summon&amp;quot; one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t seem quite right to me, but he must have had a reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The SK visions were mostly about a woman doing housework.  I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out who she was, or if it was real, but I kept seeing her walk to the kitchen wearing an apron, then moving around in the living room, maybe cleaning the floors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The air was &amp;quot;plush&amp;quot; with silent knowledge, and in the middle of the &amp;quot;holes&amp;quot; in the matrix of dreams Fancy was trying to become solid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point I could even tell her to show me a story, like she used to do back in the good old days when I hadn&amp;#39;t left the red zone much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She obliged a bit, walking back where we used to play &amp;quot;sock puppet&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was in Silent Knowledge, and there wasn&amp;#39;t any room in the air for her to act out a scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although I must admit, it might not have been entirely my faces made at her, giving her enough energy to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible she stole some energy from a witch in here.  I accidentally gave her instructions that could be interpreted two ways.  And then that witch was attacked by an ally who held her hostage for 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And at the precise moment she escaped, Fancy showed up with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The attack was a typical Fancy style activity.  Incapacitating people by showing them the abstract,  in dream form, while they inject &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot; when needed to reset the loop if you try to escape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect that might be part of how they trap males in their world, when they didn&amp;#39;t go there willingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of your attention is focused on a very vivid dream, where it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible to describe what&amp;#39;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The abstract, but not 100%  Maybe only 50% abstract, and 50% dream  you can describe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first it&amp;#39;ll hold you by itself, while they sit next to you on the bed.

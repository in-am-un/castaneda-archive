While it's still \"honest\".\n\nI suppose, we're doing harm by making it clear to all the bad players, it's Olmec, not Toltec.  They'll start to infect that term eventually, and poison the anthropologists.\n\nWho are capable of doing great harm.\n\nThink of Wasson's nonsense about how you can't smoke shrooms.\n\nChildish!  But it gets repeated by all the \"debunkers\" as if it made perfect sense.\n\nIf you could have removed Carlos from the mind of Wasson, he'd have readily admitted you could powder some shrooms and mix it with some marijuana, and make quite a smoking mixture!\n\nAs long as you inhaled, and didn't have filters in the way.\n\nThe only criticism would be, it's a bit wasteful.  But that only seems true to someone who has to buy the shrooms and the pot. If you had as much as you want, who cares if it gets you a good high?\n\nIf you think about what could have been in that smoking mixture, it seems likely to me it was in fact a bit like smoking marijuana mixed with the shrooms.  It prevents boredom and calms you down, before the shrooms kick in 30 minutes later.\n\nI'm convinced a lot of our troubles in this subreddit, come from a specific one or two sources.  Kachora students for example.  And we got a couple of \"Colorado Carlos\" attacks, but those guys are pretty stupid.

It's puzzling.  There must be vast stretches of Olmec stuff to dig up.\n\nThe Luiseno on the opposite coast of the Americas had artifacts as old as the Olmecs \"origins\".

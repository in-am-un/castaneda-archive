I know u/danl999 has discussed this but I was hoping for a bit more clarification. This passage from FFW describes dents/crevices:\n\n \"The nagual identifies that spot by its intense luminosity and pushes it, rather than striking it. The force of the push creates a dent in the cocoon and it is felt like a blow to the right shoulder blade, a blow that knocks all the air out of the lungs. \"Are there different types of dents?\" I asked. \"There are only two types,\" he responded. \"One is a concavity and the other is a crevice; each has a distinct effect. The concavity is a temporary feature and produces a temporary shift - but the crevice is a profound and permanent feature of the cocoon and produces a permanent shift.\" He explained that usually a luminous cocoon hardened by self-reflection is not affected at all by the nagual's blow. Sometimes, however, the cocoon of man is very pliable and the smallest force creates a bowl-like dent ranging in size from a small depression to one that is a third the size of the total cocoon; or it creates a crevice that may run across the width of the egglike shell, or along its length, making the cocoon look as if it has curled in on itself. Some luminous shells, after being dented, go back to their original shape instantly. Others remain dented for hours or even days at a time, but they revert back by themselves. Still others get a firm, impervious dent that requires another blow from the nagual on a bordering area to restore the original shape of the luminous cocoon. And a few never lose their indentation once they get it. No matter how many blows they get from a nagual they never revert back to their egglike shapes\" FFW pg 56 / pg 943 in the all in one pdf.\n\nTo me that sounds like you can get dented by a naguals blow or by other means like the finger wiggle described by Zuleica in The Eagles Gift:\n\n Zuleica must have seen what I was going through; she suddenly began to explain that the second attention belongs to the luminous body, as the first attention belongs to the physical body. The point where, she said, the second attention assembles itself was situated right where Juan Tuma had described it the first time we met - approximately one and one-half feet in front of the midpoint between the stomach and the belly button and four inches to the right. Zuleica ordered me to massage that place, to manipulate it by moving the fingers of both my hands right on that point as if I were playing a harp. She assured me that sooner or later I would end up feeling my fingers going through something as thick as water, and that finally I would feel my luminous shell. As I kept on moving my fingers the air got progressively thicker until I felt a mass of sorts. An undefined physical pleasure spread all over me. I thought that I was touching a nerve in my body and felt silly at the absurdity of it. I stopped.  TEG pg 128 / pg 854 in the all in one PDF.\n\nanother passage from CC after he had practiced the finger wiggle for some time:\n\n In my next session Zuleica allowed me to enter into a state of restful vigil. But this time that state was not quite as it had been before. There seemed to be a sort of control in me that curtailed my enjoying it freely, as I had done in the past - a control that also made me focus on the steps I had taken to get into it. First I noticed the itch on the point of the second attention in my luminous shell. I massaged that point by moving my fingers on it as if I were playing a harp and the point sunk towards my stomach. I felt it almost on my skin. I experienced a prickling sensation on the outside of my right calf. It was a mixture of pleasure and pain. The sensation radiated to my whole leg and then to my lower back. I felt that my buttocks were shaking. My entire body was transfixed by a nervous ripple. I thought that my body had been caught upside down in a net. My forehead and my toes seemed to be touching. I was like a closed U-shape. Then I felt as if I were being folded in two and rolled inside a sheet. My nervous spasms were what made the sheet roll into itself, with me in the center. When the rolling ended I could not sense my body any more. I was only an amorphous awareness, a nervous spasm wrapped in itself. That awareness came to rest inside a ditch, inside a depression of itself. I understood then the impossibility of describing what takes place in dreaming. Zuleica said that the right and left side awareness are wrapped up together. Both of them come to rest in one single bundle in the dent, the depressed center of the second attention. To do dreaming one needs to manipulate both the luminous body and the physical body. First, the center of assembling for the second attention has to be made accessible by being pushed in from the outside by someone else, or sucked in from within by the dreamer. Second, in order to dislodge the first attention, the centers of the physical body located in the midsection and the calves, especially the right one, have to be stimulated and placed as close to one another as possible until they seem to join. Then the sensation of being bundled takes place and automatically the second attention takes over. \n\nMy question is about finger wiggling and what comes next. I have been doing the finger wiggling regularly but sometimes I don't know what I should be doing afterwards..I did start to feel a prickling sensation throughout my body and in both of my calves but I did not take any further steps such as having the sensation of being folded in half.\n\nI think Dan said that the point of the finger wiggling is to bring the energy body closer to the physical body. Does the act of wiggling the fingers actually create the dent? \n\nThe fact that we can create that dent ourselves is because we do not have access to the naguals blow.\n\n Once the dent is created I assume it's temporary and that's why it needs to be done on a regular basis, correct?  \n\nWhat about stuffing puffs and tensegrity moves? Should you just stop wiggling your fingers long enoug to stuff puffs then continue doing it?\n\nI'm probably over thinking this but I have been reading it over and over and trying to see how I can make it work in my daily practice.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Finger Wiggle/Dents/Crevices in the Luminous Cocoon", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/3d25cf64-9180-40a4-9c8e-5eb1570a7672", "link_ids": ["t3_jkedo9", "t3_ixrw34", "t3_iubqq2", "t3_kea5zt", "t3_lwckni", "t3_lwcg6o", "t3_lqz7b6", "t3_lqr6zf", "t3_lnt8a6", "t3_lmp574", "t3_lm4zws", "t3_ll9z5w", "t3_lelqm7", "t3_leo7sy", "t3_ld3845", "t3_lc1ls0", "t3_lbsls8", "t3_l7cp8f", "t3_l6o7at", "t3_mz3kz7", "t3_mzx9gl", "t3_m0kyjq", "t3_lwwshw", "t3_m1oqf1", "t3_mx3d2u", "t3_mw8sve", "t3_mtfwhb", "t3_m2u0a0", "t3_mrkitp", "t3_mlhy6f", "t3_mauwly", "t3_cm1zxx", "t3_m30hb1", "t3_n17jdy", "t3_n1ljja", "t3_n7pwp8", "t3_n7zeae", "t3_naznr8", "t3_nc8q8m", "t3_ndsc7q", "t3_neslbo", "t3_nfw7xg", "t3_nir9g2", "t3_nk25ms", "t3_nkyszq", "t3_nogrjo", "t3_ns7tky", "t3_nvehdz", "t3_o0ifzx", "t3_o3inhw", "t3_o53rhe", "t3_o7qp2a", "t3_ogafdn", "t3_org1tv", "t3_owrd1h", "t3_ovqmgq", "t3_oyt4zt", "t3_oxczfa", "t3_ogzoth", "t3_pcyx4h", "t3_p9anre", "t3_p8asd8", "t3_p6ga7i", "t3_p5l6ye", "t3_p0fmbc", "t3_ozfrz4", "t3_pij28q", "t3_posqcc", "t3_pu14ic", "t3_pwrrc0", "t3_pxfw1a", "t3_q1fcee", "t3_q4x5cs", "t3_q57hxg", "t3_q7jpwq", "t3_q7snvr", "t3_q9epxq", "t3_qceavx", "t3_qctyq7", "t3_qdp6bb", "t3_q9idzp", "t3_qklney", "t3_qmbwgp", "t3_qn9y63", "t3_qo8gj1", "t3_qpoc9e", "t3_qr6cta", "t3_qqyzj8", "t3_rwu1f0", "t3_rw73iz", "t3_rb5o0q", "t3_sdgq2p", "t3_sf44pk", "t3_te7jnl", "t3_tu3w80", "t3_tzc628"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 2", "created_at_utc": 1611109587.162, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "3d25cf64-9180-40a4-9c8e-5eb1570a7672", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1676831407.209, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_p8asd8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 4, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_74ltk", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 4, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1629483408.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been piecing together some information from the all-in-one PDF about CC/DJ&amp;#39;s description of the dent made in the luminous cocoon.

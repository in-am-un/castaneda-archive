You aren&amp;#39;t using your eyes over there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And nothing looks like anything else, until intent forms it by skimming the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By selecting some, ignoring others, and producing a &amp;quot;realness&amp;quot; from what got selected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They saw what looked to the person at the time, like pieces of a giant Eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They call that the source of everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But since it&amp;#39;s the emanations themselves, it&amp;#39;s really just the source of itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me try to come up with an analogy, but you&amp;#39;d be better off to read the books and let it all soak in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re in a high school gang.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The blue pirates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all you know!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any question you could have, is only about that gang and their inner struggles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who&amp;#39;s coolest, who&amp;#39;s out, who&amp;#39;s in trouble lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you ask about a creator, you&amp;#39;re really just asking who&amp;#39;s coolest in the gang.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once  you get out of that gang, the question is unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s NOT important over here. Where we are right now, discussing it.  Seems valid to me at this level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We never become Saints.  If you find a &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; with saints, you have a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you find a &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; with permanent attainments, you have a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re just shitty old ourselves, and can never change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we CAN move our assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That changes reality, and we react to the new situation in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you get to where you could ask someone, it&amp;#39;s totally meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, sort of like Buddhist sacred texts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had a bad player Buddhist a couple of weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Felt sorry for a worse bad player, and decided to defend them with his vast knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Started saying how he agrees with what we&amp;#39;re doing here, because it can all be explained as levels 1-10 of his Dzogchen list of magical states.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He understood it all!  With no work done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But out there on the J curve, the road we take to the Abstract, the wisest Buddhist sacred texts explaining all higher states of consciousness, are like a huge dinner that will clearly make you very ill if you eat all of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And trying to move to higher states of consciousness by eating the entire meal quickly, is so ludicrous, you can&amp;#39;t even figure out how to explain that to a Buddhist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s an inventory expert. Believes the key to everything, is having the most complete  understanding of the rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But none of that helps, when you&amp;#39;re out there in uncharted states of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over there, you look. If you see it, you can walk over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not, you&amp;#39;re out of luck that session.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can never get over there, with important questions in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_rlmbmi", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rlmbmi/alcatraz_darkrooms/hphqmoi/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1640131745.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1640131745.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hphfow5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hpgrqaj", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "This may not be related to the topic but since IOBs can\u2019t lie have you ever asked one who or what created everything?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may not be related to the topic but since IOBs can\u2019t lie have you ever asked one who or what created everything?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rlmbmi/alcatraz_darkrooms/hphfow5/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_hphfow5", "created": 1640126866.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1640126866.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hpgrqaj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1640117078.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_rlmbmi", "score": 13, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I can believe he learned to see anything.\n\nNot on demand or as easily as he implies.

Or maybe after that.  Silent Knowledge is disorienting.\n\nUsing the recap head movement in darkness, and a focused gaze seeking out fluctuations, flashes, and sparkles in the darkness, the same way you \"look for more memories\" during recap, I uncovered another story of the Wuwonians.\n\nA sinister one...\n\nIt turns out, the Wuwonians are \"not-doing\" sorcerers, and seek above all else, to be able to create new not-doings, and succeed at the ultimate audacity.  To cause them to be accepted by society in general.\n\nThey seek to break down the walls that imprison them, by attacking the social order.\n\nBut not in a harmful way.  They only try to reduce the aspects which encroach on their sorcery practices.\n\nAnd over a very long time, they managed to do just that.  Here's the story, which was intermixed with more, but that's over in the advanced subreddit.\n\nHere's the tale, right from the storyteller himself.  But \"channeled\" using the recapitulation head sweeping movement, and no help from any other being, double or inorganic.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe Wuwonians deal with the world on the mirthful side of summoning the spirit. The humorous aspect of intending which has some \"rules\" to describe the most successful way to do that, which were passed to us in the books.\n\nOff the top of my head, bold actions, daringness, big gestures, prankish, with a touch of harmless maliciousness.\n\nThe way Julian tossed don Juan in the river for example. But that was an extreme case.\n\nThe Wuwonians view the world primarily through the mirthful combination of the best attributes of *intending*. But on occasion they delve into the darker aspects, as needed. Like stalking.\n\nTruth is, they're not-doers. But they've hidden the not-doing so deeply in their actions, no one notices. It just seems like they enjoy being funny, and it's accepted as what everyone likes about the Wuwonians. Except if you analyze it, it just means they've learned to manipulate everyone and everything, in the most efficient way possible.\n\nAnd that's nearly the same as our sorcery. And what makes them also stalkers.\n\nAnd the Wuwonians did just that.  Except they stalked the entire world, instead of just those on their \"pink side\" of the largest city.\n\nUsing their \"mirthful\" technique to summon intent, which is really just a lifestyle of not-doings such as wearing fuzzy Pajamas as their main wardrobe, or driving a ridiculous car, they also focused on the nuts and bolts of what directs the attention of people.\n\nAnd noticed something sinister: religion.\n\nIt started innocently. They noticed that the women of their world were bombarded with messages designed to control them. To focus their attention on something trivial, but with so much force that the women never got a chance to have a \"lazy day\" and just look around.\n\nIt was focused on their reproductive ability. Because once engaged it produced offspring who would keep them endlessly tired, with all of their attention obsessed with the task of rearing children.  The goal was to stop the inevitable rise of women towards magical power over men.\n\nBut to do that they needed to justify it in the minds of women, so the ancients who set up society as it is now created the idea that childbearing was the most worthwhile and fulfilling task a human could take on. Male or female.\n\nAnd the women were flattered with the idea that men can never be as good at it as women, and that it's a complete lifestyle which uses the men to support it, with the woman in charge.\n\nIt's basically what sorcerers have said about women. That they tend to look for a lifestyle, rather than a goal.\n\nSo women were brainwashed with endless media, stories, songs, Hallmark Movie Channel romantic comedies, to give them the impression there was a somewhat rough but handsome man lurking in the shadows loving them from a distance, and waiting to become their messiah who will lead them into the most fulfilling lifestyle possible: Reproducing.\n\nThe Wuwonians decided to take advantage of that tendency of humans to be so easily manipulated, and they created their own religion.\n\nIt wasn't easy and took several generations of Wuwonians, but in the end they succeeded.\n\nAnd everyone in their world knows now,  the Wuwonians are very religious. But they don't force their religion off on anyone else, so it's ok. They're sort of like Jews. But without the anti-semitism.\n\nIf you want to get your meal on an airplane before anyone else, and be treated like a king by the stewardesses, order a Kosher meal.\n\nThey bring it before everyone else gets fed, it's often chinese food, and you get brand new spoons, knives, and forks. Metal ones! Plus they treat you like you have a fatal illness, and speak kindly to you as they serve it.\n\nThe Wuwonians created their own religion to teach other people how to deal with Wuwonians.\n\nThey could have looked at Genaro and Silvio, and seen how they deal with the world.\n\nGenaro is funny and entertaining, but Silvio is ominous and scary. He can be congenial, but as a sorcerer everyone was well aware Silvio could grab the back of your neck and hurl you into the unknown. If he was displeased.\n\nGenaro would accomplish the same task but he'd likely trick you into imitating his funny goose-step marching, and just \"walk you in there\" with an occasional amusing joke to distract you along the way.\n\nTwo approaches. One fearful, one \"cool\".\n\nThe Wuwonians decided to be \"cool\".\n\nOver a very long time they created the idea that what the Wuwonians did was cooler than everyone else.\n\nThey created a crude painting style involving ink on white paper, which used brush strokes to give things \"character\".\n\nBut in fact they were just very poor paintings like a child might learn by copying just one style of anime. As a result a child can produce pleasing images which fool people who don't know any better, into thinking they have superior drawing abilities. The kids learn how to draw an anime \"meme\" type of sad eyes, missing nose, and a certain type of mouth. When seen it invokes images of that entire drawing style.\n\nSo the Wuwonians created their own \"inkwork\" style, and convinced people there was some deeper meaning in it which required looking carefully at the fine details. And that only a \"superior mind\" could perceive what the Wuwonians had hidden in that picture.\n\nYou were a \"superior being\" if you could see how great their primitive artwork really was.\n\nThe Wuwonians had *seen* that the main goal of religions is to create the idea that if you join their group you are superior.\n\nHumans want to be superior. And it doesn't distract from the brainwashing of women because they also like to feel superior, within the lifestyle they were forced to follow.\n\nThe Wuwonians also knew that to make their religion work they needed some weird magical effects for those who worked hard at it.\n\nSo they created the idea of \"paying attention to find the Wuwonian aspects\" of reality.\n\nPeople were told to be mindful of the details of all they did, seeking out the Wuwonian essence behind all of reality.\n\nIt was largely a trick to get people to stop fantasizing all the time, and look around. So that the energy draining and most pervasive aspects of the internal dialogue were reduced, resulting in their assemblage points moving into the green area on the J curve, with obvious magical results.\n\nTiny, but obvious internally.\n\nAnd they taught followers of the Wuwonian religion to \"see those aspects\" in their artwork, and the world around them. And the obsessed followers of the new religion, would even focus intensely on green line effects, and slide their assemblage point horizontally, to make those more real and vivid.\n\nThey had reached \"Wuwonian Enlightenment\".\n\nIf you could obsess over green line effects and sustain them, you became a \"superior being\".\n\nIt was almost convincing enough but they knew that humans need human confirmation of their superioress. They created licenses to teach the Wuwonian \"Principles of Superiorness\".\n\nThey created a list of \"wise sayings\" you could memorize, but so many of them and all with commentaries, that it took decades to master them. Which gave followers the feeling they were making progress.\n\nAnd an entire \"Wuwonian clothing line\". So you could boldly announce to the world, you were on the path to \"Superiorness\". Those with a teachers license got to wear the full Jedi Robe like garment, indicating you were a \"master\". Those who were only hopeful, got to brag about their desire to be superior by wearing a loud smock to show they were \"working on it\". Fluorescent orange was a popular color but various \"orders\" of Wuwonian monks wore others.\n\nAnd the Wuwonians realized it needed to extend to all areas, not just to crude ink drawings. So they allowed specialities in keeping with all aspects of culture.\n\nCrummy architects joined them and specialized in creating lifeless environments filled with sand that has patterns in it, white rocks, small plants forced to exhibit the \"Wuwonian Essence\", and cheap cement statues symbolizing aspects of the Wuwonians' life. People were told they could find peace in the barren gardens, and that only a superior being could sense it.\n\nYou could also be superior in your athletic abilities. That didn't work for actual sports that have a real goal, so they encouraged it in martial arts, where it's all pretty much pretending with no actual fighting skills. Even things like archery could be fooled, by focusing not on hitting the bull's eye, but on how you released the arrow with \"Wuwonian mirthful abandon\".\n\nYou could release the arrow in a \"superior\" way, so that it didn't matter if your archery sucked.\n\nThe Wuwonians let their licensed teachers uncover more ways to embed Wuwonian philosophy of Superiorness into all aspects of culture. Until to even question their religion brought disdain from all the inhabitants of their world.\n\nTheir goal was to convince the world around them that everything they do is \"superior\" and \"uplifting\". In a funny and pleasing way.\n\nI was busy listening to, or perhaps watching, the new story of the Wuwonians.\n\nAnd suddenly my neck popped. It's that \"snap\" at the spinal pieces connecting to the actual skull to hold the chin upright.\n\nLike a space in there was too big, so it relaxed and popped back into place. Or maybe it was slightly tilted, and fixed itself.\n\nBut the sound is unmistakable.\n\nAnd I realized, I've heard that sound all my life. It's a \"known thing\" for humans, and associated with relaxing and giving up worries for an instant.\n\nI also knew that sorcerers claim the second attention comes out as a result. Or that it indicates the double coming out. I can't recall the specifics.\n\nBut after a few seconds a \"puff body\" swarmed in front of my eyes, and I realized, it's true. The neck popping really is associated with the puffs of the energy body becoming available to help the tonal.\n\nAnd at the same time a little woman's face appeared in the outskirt puffs of the energy body, now floating in visible sight.\n\nI told her, \"It's nice to see you! It gets a little lonely here in the darkness, just listening to stories all night.\"\n\nShe smiled.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Further Tales of the Wuwonians", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"1aofj1rjljv81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1aofj1rjljv81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c34667af9cb474fafbbc6f3890946ffec473ecd"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1aofj1rjljv81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=790a22f65077447aa4b3fc5c588b216e1de1a820"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1aofj1rjljv81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=244901f9eba9281230092801f7749c5cc0e8c999"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1aofj1rjljv81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=850dd5e99b494ccf747cf9d4538bc222b8ab2d77"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1aofj1rjljv81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47e06592928930b0562106985989d0c16409fefe"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1aofj1rjljv81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce9a5b520ec974f9ee5380555d81bbb7dc8c4fa9"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/1aofj1rjljv81.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5689f50d32dc3b0213dd53b9abef1aebd3ec577"}, "id": "1aofj1rjljv81"}}, "name": "t3_uazp6u", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/P4DnMR7bGHLuHNIyGzMes7bytS466UD8auuVBMg1DyU.jpg", "edited": 1650834684.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1650821289.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1aofj1rjljv81.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e5689f50d32dc3b0213dd53b9abef1aebd3ec577\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/1aofj1rjljv81.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e5689f50d32dc3b0213dd53b9abef1aebd3ec577&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If my venture into silent knowledge via the double wasn&amp;#39;t weird enough, here&amp;#39;s what happened before that.

Or maybe it was slightly tilted, and fixed itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the sound is unmistakable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I realized, I&amp;#39;ve heard that sound all my life. It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;known thing&amp;quot; for humans, and associated with relaxing and giving up worries for an instant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also knew that sorcerers claim the second attention comes out as a result. Or that it indicates the double coming out. I can&amp;#39;t recall the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after a few seconds a &amp;quot;puff body&amp;quot; swarmed in front of my eyes, and I realized, it&amp;#39;s true. The neck popping really is associated with the puffs of the energy body becoming available to help the tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And at the same time a little woman&amp;#39;s face appeared in the outskirt puffs of the energy body, now floating in visible sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s nice to see you! It gets a little lonely here in the darkness, just listening to stories all night.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She smiled.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "uazp6u", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 6, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/uazp6u/further_tales_of_the_wuwonians/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/uazp6u/further_tales_of_the_wuwonians/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1650821289.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i60xpcx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Ok-Assistance175", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1650822188.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_uazp6u", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_9qdplfxw", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "The pinkish zoo suit is damn cool!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i60xpcx", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pinkish zoo suit is damn cool!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/uazp6u/further_tales_of_the_wuwonians/i60xpcx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1650822188.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_uazp6u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_uazp6u", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i60yzfq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_uazp6u", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "Someone or some force often likes to try and divert my recap into little teachings and mini-daydreams.

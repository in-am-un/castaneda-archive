First, is there any position your body should be in while trying to silence yourself? Should I sit? Lie down? Does it matter? My flat is setup in a way that the only room which can get complete dark is the bathroom, and I can't really lie down there. I live with a girlfriend so duct taping the windows on one of the room is not an option for me. Next, I am curious about the term you all use, 'forcing the silence'. I have limited experience with mindfulness meditation, every time you become aware of thoughts, you just let them go and just observe until nothing remains, I find the process very relaxing but judging from descriptions about forcing the silence, I don't think it is the same thing, as it is often described here as something excruciating. Can you try to put in words exactly what you are doing while practicing silence? Any tips about you thin might be important? Also, I read that open eyes are a must, would a black painted snorkeling mask do the job? Next, regarding the time of the day. I read Castaneda more than 15 years ago when I was a kid just entering puberty, I was fascinated by dreaming. It took me a year to leave the body for the first time but eventually I got quite good at it, I used to do it quite regularly for a long time (although I could never maintain myself in that state for more than a few minutes) until I saw some really scary stuff which made me stop doing it, but in all the years I was doing it, I never could leave the body during the daylight, regardless of how dark is the room, it was always late at night, 2-3 am. Not sure if this is something other people experience, but in case it is, is there something similar to this with darkroom practice? Is your practice more fruitful at certain time of the day or night? Or better to say, not for you, but for a beginner? As I said, I read Castaneda books 15 years ago, currently rereading them, and my memory of many things is vague at best, so sorry if I asked something that nicely described somewhere.\n\nOh, and one more thing, just out curiosity, can you actually see the assemblage point?", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Posting for a \"demon\" guy.", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_obweev", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 5, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1625177060.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got this in private chat, and was hoping someone else would answer some of the questions.

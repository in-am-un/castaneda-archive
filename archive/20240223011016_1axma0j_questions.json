You can in fact learn to visibly see this, so it's not a theory.  Inside each egg 16 blobs of awareness, the size of soccer balls, were stuffed.\n\n8 of those blobs found a physical body in the form of an infant in the womb, and went into the internal organs. We call them \"energy pouches\", and you can, through silence, visually look down at those organs and clearly see this very brilliant glow of awareness.\n\nBut the other 8 blobs either refused to participate in being trapped like that, or there wasn't any room left.\n\nThe 8 stuck in the \"pouches\" experienced the full effect of \"reality\" in a physical body, and developed purpose, reason, fear, greed, grief, sadness, love...\n\nIt became as \"real\" as an awareness can, when placed into a physical body.\n\nThe other 8 puffs that were \"free\", but could not leave the egg we were created in, fled to the inside of the shell, to get as far away from the grief and worry stricken \"Tonal\" awareness as it could. They now roam in phantom realms of their own creation. Dreams.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/slzl8w3zfckc1.jpeg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f13636624979e8a1d2f45cdf0d2612d8698f415f\n\nThat's the \"nagual\" portion. But the word \"Nagual\" is like the word \"love\".\n\nIf you're an idiot, you combine all 10 basic meanings of the word \"Love\" together into one giant misunderstanding, so that you can gloss over reality and pretend \"the universe is based on love\".\n\nThat claim sells workshops and books! Women just eat that \"love\" stuff up.\n\nBut it fact we clearly live in a **predatorial** universe.\n\nSo don't make the mistake of combining all (perhaps 5) meanings for the word \"nagual\", into one word.\n\nThere's \"nagual\" as it refers to those 8 puffs of awareness which did not get \"domesticated\" to become our \"self\". The Tonal.\n\nNaturally this sounds nutty until you see it yourself, and have your own Nagual standing right there, fully visible, next to you as you practice sorcery. I spend at least 20 minutes messing around with my double each day. Visibly.\n\nBut you can also learn about this when the Nagual of a person you know walks right through the wall to come visit with you, while you're practicing sorcery.\n\nThose can extract your own nagual (double) to involve it in a game of chase across continents.\n\nMy witch enemy Cholita used to do that with me.  From my point of view, she walked through my locked door.\n\nShe's dangerous, so I keep it locked.\n\nBut her \"double\" is relatively friendly, and once it decides to involve me in a game of chase, it materializes a path on which to run, right there in my room.  And if I follow her, I also go right through the wall.\n\nI switch, seamlessly, to my \"nagual\".  Because for example, suddenly there's a pleasant mountain trail right in front of me, with Cholita running away on it, gleefully.\n\nWe kick butt!  I hope you realize fully what you found in this subreddit.\n\nThere's no one  out there in any religion or magical system doing even a tiny bit of what we do.\n\nBut we also have to work FAR harder than they do, in order to accomplish it.\n\n\\&gt;2)Left vs Right side\n\nAn illusion created by \"man's band of awareness\" going through our body at a slight angle.  This cartoon shows it  (Techno has them in the wiki too, but I haven't gone through it):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1AchLvoP\\_Y&amp;list=PLI0sRqIalXH6XrHuhA31NVVVn\\_4X6C48d&amp;index=6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1AchLvoP_Y&amp;list=PLI0sRqIalXH6XrHuhA31NVVVn_4X6C48d&amp;index=6)\n\n\\&gt;3)Male vs Female warrior\n\nWomen are very talented because their monthly period never allows their assemblage points to become so fixed, that they can't move.  But they lack self-motivation and seek out others with which to practice magic. Which is fatal. There are no others.\n\nMen lack talent, but have an urge to take over the Chimp tribe and beat their chests, so they are self-motivated and maniacally obsessed.  One of those out of 500 has a chance to learn sorcery.  But only 1,  because the rest aren't willing to put in the practice time.\n\n4)Don Juan vs Don Jinaro\n\nA double being, versus a \"man of action\" type. My last statement about men wanting to take over the tribe, was a gross exaggeration. Some like to be assistants, some like to entertain, some like to  heal.  There's a few specific \"types\" of men, which can be visibly seen in Silent Knowledge. So that you could simply look, and tell what type of male you were dealing with.\n\nSame for women. There's \"types\".  But these are not philosophical or psychological observations.  it's based on how many bumps and tentacles they have attached to their waist.\n\nSomething you can fairly easily learn to see with your own eyes.\n\n5)Teacher vs Benefactor\n\nA \"benefactor\" is a lame Man of Knowledge type, who's goal in life is earning a living by selling magical superstitions to the na\u00efve.\n\nIn the time of the Olmecs, they were licensed by the government and took up various places in society, selling religious behavior.  They even made cookies and holiday masks.\n\nBut the one you're referring to is the one which used rituals, an Ally, and drugs, to put on a show for customers.\n\nLike a cheap gypsy fortune teller.  Except, they had real magic they could demonstrate.  So you have to admire at least that they weren't total frauds, like everyone in modern times.\n\nA \"teacher\" is too vague, but let's assume you mean a \"seer teacher\".\n\nOne who teaches seeing.\n\nThose are not profiteers.  They're lone explorers, who because they were helped to learn by someone else, feel an obligation to pass it on to another person.\n\nIn the time of the Olmecs they were given small children as apprentices.  Younglings like in Star Wars, which is based on the same books we use to learn sorcery.\n\nSo the children just grew up, learning sorcery.\n\nNo profit involved there.\n\nDon't make the mistake of believing our goal is to be \"Men of Knowledge\".\n\nThat's not a worthy goal.  If you run into anyone saying that, flee away as fast as you can.\n\n6)Don Juan vs Zuleika (Male vs Female Nagual)\n\nDon Juan was a male nagual, but Zuleica was a crazy westerly witch, like Cholita, my enemy.\n\n7)First vs Second vs Third attention\n\nFirst attention is what you are seeing right now.\n\nIf you went into a dream, or had a vision during meditation, that's the second attention.\n\nThe third attention is reached when you practice our darkroom technique until you can move your assemblage point from up at your shoulder blades, down to the bottom, under and up the front of your body and over to the right side of the stomach.\n\nIn less than 2 seconds.\n\nIt lights up all of the emanations in Man's band of Awareness.   And dissolves that egg container our awareness was placed in.\n\n8)Dreamer vs Stalker\n\nA very bad thing to be focusing on, since people can pretend they are practicing \"stalking\" just because they're assholes who like to trick others.\n\nBut in fact, stalking is merely using your normal world to move your assemblage point to a new position, and hold it there.\n\nThe key being, moving your assemblage point. The very thing pretenders in our community never learned to do.\n\nA dreamer is someone who is more interested in dreaming realms than in the waking world.\n\nBut ideally they do their dreaming fully awake, as you see in many of the posts in this subreddit.\n\nIf you try to do otherwise, you will fail.\n\nThere's no path to sorcery knowledge in sleeping dreams.\n\nThat belief was made up by our lazy community.\n\nThe only path is silence, which inevitably produces waking dreaming.", "edited": 1708699678.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_krrpf70", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Tonal vs Nagual&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We seem to have been created as &amp;quot;eggs&amp;quot; to hold awareness.  You can in fact learn to visibly see this, so it&amp;#39;s not a theory.  Inside each egg 16 blobs of awareness, the size of soccer balls, were stuffed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8 of those blobs found a physical body in the form of an infant in the womb, and went into the internal organs. We call them &amp;quot;energy pouches&amp;quot;, and you can, through silence, visually look down at those organs and clearly see this very brilliant glow of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the other 8 blobs either refused to participate in being trapped like that, or there wasn&amp;#39;t any room left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 8 stuck in the &amp;quot;pouches&amp;quot; experienced the full effect of &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot; in a physical body, and developed purpose, reason, fear, greed, grief, sadness, love...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It became as &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; as an awareness can, when placed into a physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other 8 puffs that were &amp;quot;free&amp;quot;, but could not leave the egg we were created in, fled to the inside of the shell, to get as far away from the grief and worry stricken &amp;quot;Tonal&amp;quot; awareness as it could. They now roam in phantom realms of their own creation. Dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/slzl8w3zfckc1.jpeg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f13636624979e8a1d2f45cdf0d2612d8698f415f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/slzl8w3zfckc1.jpeg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f13636624979e8a1d2f45cdf0d2612d8698f415f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;nagual&amp;quot; portion. But the word &amp;quot;Nagual&amp;quot; is like the word &amp;quot;love&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re an idiot, you combine all 10 basic meanings of the word &amp;quot;Love&amp;quot; together into one giant misunderstanding, so that you can gloss over reality and pretend &amp;quot;the universe is based on love&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That claim sells workshops and books! Women just eat that &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it fact we clearly live in a &lt;strong&gt;predatorial&lt;/strong&gt; universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t make the mistake of combining all (perhaps 5) meanings for the word &amp;quot;nagual&amp;quot;, into one word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;nagual&amp;quot; as it refers to those 8 puffs of awareness which did not get &amp;quot;domesticated&amp;quot; to become our &amp;quot;self&amp;quot;. The Tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally this sounds nutty until you see it yourself, and have your own Nagual standing right there, fully visible, next to you as you practice sorcery. I spend at least 20 minutes messing around with my double each day. Visibly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can also learn about this when the Nagual of a person you know walks right through the wall to come visit with you, while you&amp;#39;re practicing sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those can extract your own nagual (double) to involve it in a game of chase across continents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My witch enemy Cholita used to do that with me.  From my point of view, she walked through my locked door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s dangerous, so I keep it locked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But her &amp;quot;double&amp;quot; is relatively friendly, and once it decides to involve me in a game of chase, it materializes a path on which to run, right there in my room.  And if I follow her, I also go right through the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I switch, seamlessly, to my &amp;quot;nagual&amp;quot;.  Because for example, suddenly there&amp;#39;s a pleasant mountain trail right in front of me, with Cholita running away on it, gleefully.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We kick butt!  I hope you realize fully what you found in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no one  out there in any religion or magical system doing even a tiny bit of what we do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we also have to work FAR harder than they do, in order to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;2)Left vs Right side&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An illusion created by &amp;quot;man&amp;#39;s band of awareness&amp;quot; going through our body at a slight angle.  This cartoon shows it  (Techno has them in the wiki too, but I haven&amp;#39;t gone through it):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1AchLvoP_Y&amp;amp;list=PLI0sRqIalXH6XrHuhA31NVVVn_4X6C48d&amp;amp;index=6\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1AchLvoP_Y&amp;amp;list=PLI0sRqIalXH6XrHuhA31NVVVn_4X6C48d&amp;amp;index=6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;3)Male vs Female warrior&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women are very talented because their monthly period never allows their assemblage points to become so fixed, that they can&amp;#39;t move.  But they lack self-motivation and seek out others with which to practice magic. Which is fatal. There are no others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men lack talent, but have an urge to take over the Chimp tribe and beat their chests, so they are self-motivated and maniacally obsessed.  One of those out of 500 has a chance to learn sorcery.  But only 1,  because the rest aren&amp;#39;t willing to put in the practice time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4)Don Juan vs Don Jinaro&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A double being, versus a &amp;quot;man of action&amp;quot; type. My last statement about men wanting to take over the tribe, was a gross exaggeration. Some like to be assistants, some like to entertain, some like to  heal.  There&amp;#39;s a few specific &amp;quot;types&amp;quot; of men, which can be visibly seen in Silent Knowledge. So that you could simply look, and tell what type of male you were dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for women. There&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;types&amp;quot;.  But these are not philosophical or psychological observations.  it&amp;#39;s based on how many bumps and tentacles they have attached to their waist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something you can fairly easily learn to see with your own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5)Teacher vs Benefactor&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;benefactor&amp;quot; is a lame Man of Knowledge type, who&amp;#39;s goal in life is earning a living by selling magical superstitions to the na\u00efve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the time of the Olmecs, they were licensed by the government and took up various places in society, selling religious behavior.  They even made cookies and holiday masks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the one you&amp;#39;re referring to is the one which used rituals, an Ally, and drugs, to put on a show for customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a cheap gypsy fortune teller.  Except, they had real magic they could demonstrate.  So you have to admire at least that they weren&amp;#39;t total frauds, like everyone in modern times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;teacher&amp;quot; is too vague, but let&amp;#39;s assume you mean a &amp;quot;seer teacher&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One who teaches seeing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are not profiteers.  They&amp;#39;re lone explorers, who because they were helped to learn by someone else, feel an obligation to pass it on to another person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the time of the Olmecs they were given small children as apprentices.  Younglings like in Star Wars, which is based on the same books we use to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the children just grew up, learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No profit involved there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t make the mistake of believing our goal is to be &amp;quot;Men of Knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not a worthy goal.  If you run into anyone saying that, flee away as fast as you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6)Don Juan vs Zuleika (Male vs Female Nagual)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan was a male nagual, but Zuleica was a crazy westerly witch, like Cholita, my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7)First vs Second vs Third attention&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First attention is what you are seeing right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you went into a dream, or had a vision during meditation, that&amp;#39;s the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The third attention is reached when you practice our darkroom technique until you can move your assemblage point from up at your shoulder blades, down to the bottom, under and up the front of your body and over to the right side of the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In less than 2 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It lights up all of the emanations in Man&amp;#39;s band of Awareness.   And dissolves that egg container our awareness was placed in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8)Dreamer vs Stalker&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very bad thing to be focusing on, since people can pretend they are practicing &amp;quot;stalking&amp;quot; just because they&amp;#39;re assholes who like to trick others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, stalking is merely using your normal world to move your assemblage point to a new position, and hold it there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key being, moving your assemblage point.

You&amp;#39;d starve to death, or someone would throw you into a very deep cenote for being annoying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of what we practice is a &amp;quot;theory&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all &amp;quot;energetic facts&amp;quot; about how reality really works, once you can free yourself of the prison we&amp;#39;ve been put into since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just so you don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s double-talk, &amp;quot;energetic facts&amp;quot; are supernatural things you get to see &lt;strong&gt;daily&lt;/strong&gt;, with your own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t learn from talking and reading, we learn from viewing real magic, over a long time, and figuring out how to make use of it, or make it more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile ancient Greek stuff is speculative, mostly untrue, and not based on direct observations of how reality actually works.  Mostly it&amp;#39;s based on direct observations of what makes audiences cheer when you talk about your theories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Greek stuff is probably a lot better than greedy Asian philosophy and religion, but not by enough to get you real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Greek &lt;strong&gt;science&lt;/strong&gt; was wonderful, but Greek philosophy is a death trap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you believe that stuff, you aren&amp;#39;t going anywhere with real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the real thing takes hard work, where as philosophizing only takes reading, writing,  and talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s always the issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you want the real thing badly enough to work hard, or whether you only want to talk about it, with other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1axma0j/questions/krsnrxz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1708710435.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1axma0j", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kroyg0m", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "pinkerton904", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1708648817.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1axma0j", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_p5p3i8a0", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I recommend searching through this subreddit's past posts by typing in keywords or using the menu bar to access topics.

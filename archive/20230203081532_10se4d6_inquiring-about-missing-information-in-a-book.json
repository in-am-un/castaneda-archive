Intent favors action, so just get in the darkroom and do! That said, silence is the most important thing to work on if you want to have a good time in the darkroom. \n\nAlso, your post history is concerning. You seem to be involved in several other systems such as magick and occult practices. If you are a man, you must seek to drop these practices immediately, and I'm not telling you this to try to force a cult-like adherence to our path but consider this: \n\nOur modern world has tons and tons of different religions, spiritual systems, etc each with their own intent paths. Our intent here goes all the way back to the original Olmec seers 10,000 years ago. As such, their intent trail is extremely faint, like a barely comprehensible \"radio signal\" if you will, because very few are currently doing our sorcery.\nTensegrity is a simply a series of the favorite \"not-doings\" of the ancient seers which also happen to be magical in nature. Doing them will lock you into that very faint intent trail and signal to intent which exact path you want to follow! And this here is a path that will get you real magic quickly! So if you're off insisting on practicing 10 other systems at the same time, intent will simply reward you with progress averaged out between 10 other systems and you'll just get nowhere. You may even go backwards and submerge more into the river of shit if you do that. Keep in mind that the most powerful sorcery in our world is the insanely powerful sorcery of the river of shit! It forces us to remain locked into the seemingly rigid, excessively rational, linear perception of consensus reality shared by billions of other human beings. Its magnetic pull is so insanely strong that we must endeavor to insist leaving it at all costs! So how can you escape the insanely powerful pull of the tonal when you're saddled down with so many other beliefs and interpretation systems that are OF the island of the tonal, magick included?\n\nI mean, don't you want to \"escape the prison planet\"? We here are offering you a real path to do that; this path leads to complete freedom of perception! No need to waste precious time and energy on endless mental masturbations on the plight of being stuck here, \"theorycrafting\", and endless rational thinking that will just get you nowhere. You could be actually doing actions that lead to freedom!", "edited": 1675565967.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j77tv4y", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t spend too much time worrying if you are doing darkroom 100% properly or making sure you have everything set up perfectly from the get go. Intent favors action, so just get in the darkroom and do! That said, silence is the most important thing to work on if you want to have a good time in the darkroom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, your post history is concerning. You seem to be involved in several other systems such as magick and occult practices. If you are a man, you must seek to drop these practices immediately, and I&amp;#39;m not telling you this to try to force a cult-like adherence to our path but consider this: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our modern world has tons and tons of different religions, spiritual systems, etc each with their own intent paths. Our intent here goes all the way back to the original Olmec seers 10,000 years ago. As such, their intent trail is extremely faint, like a barely comprehensible &amp;quot;radio signal&amp;quot; if you will, because very few are currently doing our sorcery.\nTensegrity is a simply a series of the favorite &amp;quot;not-doings&amp;quot; of the ancient seers which also happen to be magical in nature. Doing them will lock you into that very faint intent trail and signal to intent which exact path you want to follow! And this here is a path that will get you real magic quickly! So if you&amp;#39;re off insisting on practicing 10 other systems at the same time, intent will simply reward you with progress averaged out between 10 other systems and you&amp;#39;ll just get nowhere. You may even go backwards and submerge more into the river of shit if you do that. Keep in mind that the most powerful sorcery in our world is the insanely powerful sorcery of the river of shit! It forces us to remain locked into the seemingly rigid, excessively rational, linear perception of consensus reality shared by billions of other human beings. Its magnetic pull is so insanely strong that we must endeavor to insist leaving it at all costs! So how can you escape the insanely powerful pull of the tonal when you&amp;#39;re saddled down with so many other beliefs and interpretation systems that are OF the island of the tonal, magick included?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, don&amp;#39;t you want to &amp;quot;escape the prison planet&amp;quot;?

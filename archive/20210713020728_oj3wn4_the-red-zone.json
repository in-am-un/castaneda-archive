There even more fun, in that whitish light.  You just have to know where to look for it.\n\nIt's access to real worlds!\n\nAnd the best way to perfect silence and learning what Tensegrity does.\n\nExample: You are all the way into full on heightened awareness.\n\nIn front of you is a complex matrix of emanations.\n\nSome take on dream form, but remain transparent whitish pink, not fully forming.\n\nGaze at those.\n\nIf you have a LOT of energy that night, they won't remain as transparent vague dreams.\n\nThey'll turn solid on you and you'll get distracted from watching energy itself.  Just because they take on concrete form, you will likely be lured away from watching pure energy.\n\nIf you don't have a lot of energy that night, but have learned to move the assemblage point there anyway, you might be slightly better off.  \n\nThey won't take on concrete form, and will remain vague.  But not just emanations. They'll still obviously be trying to form into something via intent.\n\nIn that state, you can watch how the vague tries to mutate into something more real, but can't.  Not enough energy. So it reverts back to emanations, and you get to watch that process for hours if you like.\n\nIf you do in fact try to watch that for hours (probably impossible in the long run), you move so far into the left at that position (I assume), that you begin to blank out.\n\nSo imagine this:  You are \"seeing energy\" in it's pure and mutating form.  It's like a spectroscope.\n\nLike a tool a scientist might buy to analyze the content of samples.\n\nBut you're falling asleep at the console of the tool!\n\nSo you stand up and jog a bit.\n\nIn the scientists world that is.  \n\nIn ours, we don't stand up and jog.

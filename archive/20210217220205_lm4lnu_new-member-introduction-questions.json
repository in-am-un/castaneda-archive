Not sure where to start and after spending the majority of the last two days reading the posts/wiki here I have a lot of questions. Not sure where to start so get ready for my ramblings.\n\nI happened upon this subreddit while I was browsing /r/highstrangeness and I saw Dan's comment on that post about the lady seeing the grey/amber puff in her room. I must admit, when I saw [this](https://preview.redd.it/dhfgf46ukcf61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebe660d161360da64a2d195fd0c71882e61ca8ea) image I thought this was another wacko feel good cult (or \"book deal\" club as you like to say. I don't know why that phrase is so funny to me, but I love it). I came to investigate and see what brand of mental illness you all have here, but instead I found this information captivating. The more I read the more I understood that this is no \"book deal\" club. At first it seemed to me that the image was so strange and low quality because Dan isn't well versed in  image editing software. Then it occurred to me that perhaps he doesn't bother making higher quality images because it would be a waste of time, people are still going to criticize no matter what you show them. But then why bother making such images at all when all the information in them can be found here in text? To attract the 1 in 10,000 who will actually become sorcerers I suppose. Not claiming that I will certainly become one of those, if I'm being brutally honest about myself I lack self-discipline. Often I try to learn/teach myself something new only to give up when I hit the first large obstacle. I hope I will follow through with this practice, what I've read so far is the most interesting esoteric knowledge I've ever read, and perhaps the *only* true esoteric knowledge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis subreddit particularly interested me because of something that started happening to me about two and a half weeks ago. That sentence probably just set off an alarm in your head that  I'm an \"inventory expert\" but I promise I'm anything but. I work from home and it was a particularly slow week for me. I work in the mortgage industry and my company is in the process of migrating from one software to another. The majority of the people I work with either can barely use computers at all or they only have a Mac at home and have no idea how to operate a Windows machine. This lead to me having almost nothing to do because I have no work if nobody else is working. Naturally instead of getting paid to stare at my email inbox all day waiting for work to come in, I decided to play some video games. Two of my friends (brothers) were playing a game called Factorio. I owned this game but it didn't interest me at first so I hadn't touched it since a bought it a few years ago. Since none of my other friends were online, I decided to join their game. For some reason the game just clicked once I started playing with them and I got absorbed in it. They had to leave after a two hours or so but I kept playing. I racked up 100 hours of play time in a week. Now let me explain what the game actually is. It's really more like work than a game but something about it is just so satisfying. The premise of the game is that you harvest the eight naturally occurring resources (stone, copper, iron, water, oil, coal, and to a lesser extent wood and uranium) to craft machines and design factories that automatically harvest the resources for you and craft them into other things, with the end goal being eventually building a rocket to space. Sounds simple right? Wrong. There's a lot of math and logistics involved in making your factory compact and efficient, which is what you want in order to progress the fastest. Did I mention the alien bugs? All the machines create pollution, and if your pollution cloud reaches a bug nest then they'll come and attack your factory. That's why you want it compact, so you don't have to waste more time building defenses, and then repairing those defenses when something inevitably breaks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point you might be wondering what the hell a video game has to do with this subreddit, but I think some of you might see where I'm going with this. I was so absorbed in the game that I was unintentionally practicing inner silence. I was only thinking about how to progress in the game, all my normal thoughts and worries  vanished while I spent my time on this game. I believe I may have unintentionally shifted my AP slightly by doing so (I read something around here that said something about any form of discipline leading to a shift of the AP or something like that. Sorry for not being able to point to exactly what post I'm talking about here, as I said I've been reading a lot here the past two days and I hadn't thought to bookmark any posts in relation to my introduction here). I started to accidentally visualize scary images while trying to sleep, something that hasn't happened since I was around 10 years old or so (I'm nearly 22 now). I even started to worry about shadow men in my closet! Ha! Another interesting thing happened too. I almost couldn't sleep because I was still thinking about the game, even while I lie in bed. I tried meditating/forcing inner silence in order to get some sleep. I practice silence (although not diligently) to prevent my coworkers getting on my nerves too much. If I meditate with my eyes closed for long enough, I will start to see colors. It usually starts with purple/deep blue and if I focus on them without thinking too much, orange/yellow/red/green also appear. If I focus even more, sometimes shapes will appear, usually a strange looking face. Usually when start to see anything face-like I panic and open my eyes, hoping I'm not starting to go crazy. I attributed this to pareidolia + meditating but after lurking around here I'm not so sure. Anyway, on  the third day of obsessing over Factorio I was trying to silence myself while laying down so I could sleep. The blue/purple mists started to come into view in my eyelids. I think I was kind of ignoring them because I really just wanted to sleep. After I don't know how long, a rainbow-ish mist appeared from the edges of my vision and started swirling into the the center, forming the face of a woman. I focused on this face and a whole woman materialized, standing in what appeared to be a back yard. I don't remember exactly what she said, but it was something along the lines of \"I haven't seen you in a while,\" and then she moved in to hug me. At that point I feel like something is wrong and I panic and leave the dream. The backyard instantly disappeared, but I still saw the shape of the woman, although translucent, coming toward me, and then it looked like her transparent head/torso (all I could see) went through my physical body, then I opened my eyes and looked around my room in a panic. Everything was as it should be in the physical, of course. Over the next few nights, I saw the rainbow mists swirling into the shape of a face a few more times, but I always opened my eyes to make it go away before anything realistic looking materialized. The last time it happened, it started swirling into the shape of a [grey alien](http://stmedia.startribune.com/images/jameslileks_1389636946_greyalien.jpg) instead of a woman. That one really made me freak out and I haven't done any long meditation sessions since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is actually the second time this kind of thing has happened to me, but I can't remember anything I was doing the first time that would have triggered it happening. A few months ago, I was trying to meditate in bed in an attempt to lucid dream, and the rainbow swirls appeared and materialized into different woman in a different backyard than this most recent time. But the process was pretty much the same. I meditated until the swirls showed up, they swirled into the shape of a woman's face, it materialized into a dream, she said some \"long time no see\" type of phrase, moved in for a hug, and then I panicked and \"woke up\", seeing the woman's translucent body appear to drift through my physical body. This happened three times in quick succession the first time, three different looking women, three different backyards, and three different, although similar, sentences spoken by them to me as I panic and then wake up, seeing the translucent body drift through mine. Over the next two or three days I saw the rainbow swirls start to materialize seven or eight times. I think twice I opened my eyes before they had the chance to swirl into any familiar shape, four or five times they started to swirl into a woman's face, and two or three times they swirled into the shape of a grey alien. Those guys really freak me out, I have no reason to believe that I can be harmed during any of this, nor do I believe that if real aliens exist they would want to harm humans, but something about seeing one in the dream world just freaks me out.  I worry about going any deeper because I was born prematurely via a C-section. I had a left atrial flutter (heart arrythmia) so they had to rip me out of my mother and fix me before it caused any problems. My heart hasn't caused me any problems since, and I'm moderately  healthy as of my last check up, but I'm still paranoid about scary things giving me a heart attack or something. But I believe the creepiness of it all is actually a good thing because it can help move the AP, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, what do you all make of the above? Is it at all related to the real sorcery that goes on here? Is it just a trick of a normal, tired brain? Or worst of all, am I actually going crazy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a few more questions, some of them I know can be answered by reading around here more, so I'll just ask the ones that are more immediately pertinent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.) Must the darkroom practice be done at night? From what I've read so far it seems kind of vague. My current understanding is that either is must be done at night, or it is better to do it at night, or you guys mostly do it at night because that is when you have the opportunity. My father covered the windows in his room to help him sleep so it's almost pitch black in there already, all I would have to do is stuff something under the door and unplug the alarm clock. The problem is that I could only use it during the day, he tends to hang out in there when he gets home from work, which is before nightfall on most days.\n\n2.) If it is imperative that I practice at night, could I use a van as my darkroom instead of an actual room? With the whole /r/vandwellers craze I thought I would see some van-people here but so far I haven't seen any. I bought a Chevy Astro right before COVID hit with the intention to turn it into a weekend camper van, but I decided that going out in the wilderness was too risky with COVID around. Don't want to injure myself and then have to risk catching COVID in the emergency room. It would be pretty easy to make the inside of the van pitch black, but there isn't room to stand up straight in there. I suppose I could install a high-top so I could fully stand up, but my family would think I'm totally crazy if I did that just to \"meditate\". I do think it could be interesting to see the effect of having the same \"darkroom\" in different physical places while I practice, should that make any difference at all. And I'm not sure how the whole \"phantom room\" thing would work with a van either, but I suppose I can cross  that bridge when I come to it, however long that may take.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that's all I have to say for now, thank you for taking the time to read and respond to my post. I'll be incessantly refreshing this page so I  can order stuff to blackout my van ASAP if necessary. If you need anything clarified so you can answer my questions, I should respond within 10 minutes.\n\nQuick edit: I forgot to mention, I saw a few posts here regarding VR headsets and I do happen to have one, so if anyone would like me to experiment with using that for sorcery, I would be happy to comply\n\nHave an excellent day everyone : \\^ )", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "New Member Introduction/Questions", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_lm4lnu", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1613595725.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, I&amp;#39;m so excited to be here and learn with you all!

terribly hard to make a puffery simulator type game, but I have no idea how you would make that interesting. \n\nOhh...  But there is!\n\nYou discovered it! \n\nAn IOB got interested in you, as a result of playing.\n\nHere's how it works:  If you consciously look at ANYTHING coming from the second attention, that means you can interact with the IOBs.\n\nThey're always looking for new playmates!\n\nIt works in sleeping dreaming.  You become lucid, look at your hands to stabilize yourself in a body, then look deliberately at dream images.\n\nWhen you get the feeling, \"Hey, this looks so real!!!\", that's when the IOBs notice you.\n\nThis is part of \"The Gates of Dreaming\" sorcery technique.  You get an IOB first, so you can borrow their dark energy to go further.\n\nThe \"rule\" states, the energy created by looking at objects from the second attention, consciously, \"compels\" the inorganic beings to send a scout.\n\nI suppose they have a union of some kind???\n\nWho knows. But they follow the rule, which is all that matters.\n\nThis is important to darkroom gazers, because the rule DOES NOT require you to be asleep.\n\nPuffery summons them even better than lucid dreaming.\n\nAnd, I'll propose, while playing video games, your second attention gets involved.\n\nBecause the internal dialogue is reduced.\n\nSo, there's absolutely no reason a demon can't jump right out of the screen!\n\nOr for those who have sensitive hearts, Mickey Mouse.\n\nBut I have to say, in the real world, standing right in front of you, Mickey is a lot scarier than a demon. \n\nYou know what the demon wants.  But Mickey??  \n\nSo it is NOT IMPOSSIBLE to design a creepy game which brings Fairy, Minx, Fancy, and Mystery out of the game, and into the room with you.\n\nOr at least, Fairy would go for it.  We'd just have her pass as a warmup before the game. One time, stretch your neck to prevent soreness from playing too long.    \n\nAnd some periodic shoulder stretching to redeploy energy.\n\nBuild in Tensegrity moves at the different levels.\n\nYou'd play in full darkness, with only the monitor for light.\n\nIt could be like the creepy movie where if you watch a certain video, supernatural forces come for you.\n\nWe could absolutely, 100%, do that.\n\nBut it is worth the effort?\n\nProbably not.  And would you end up getting sued over and over, for terrifying children?\n\nIt's just intriguing because it's possible to do that.\n\nThe thing at the top is indeed Mystery. Except the only Oyster head I could find, is from Star Trek. So Mystery looks a little more like a human. But not much.  He almost always has a mane, like a lion.\n\nThat witch is Fancy, not Fairy.  She favors that appearance for teaching witchcraft.  Or one slightly more like Hell Raiser demons.\n\nFairy is gone.  One night, maybe 5 months ago, she  insisted I draw  up that picture of \"Fairy's Pass\", which Carlos taught just once in classes.\n\nRight next to me I might add.  Not more than 3 feet away. It was curious. That's what I remember most about it. Unexpected.\n\nFairy retaught it to me around 2AM, and shortly after forced me to drive to work, draw it, and put it on line before I realized how crazy that was.\n\nShe's gone. I only get a glimpse of her world now and then, while assembling others.\n\nWhether she visits Cholita anymore, I have no idea.\n\nCosmic Strip club?\n\nNope, no joke.\n\nBasically you can manifest anything you can think of, when you get perfect silence.\n\nSo of course, men think to manifest women.\n\nYou just state a thing, and return to silence.\n\n\"Spatula\" works.\n\nBut so does \"Woman in underwear\".\n\nPatanjali taught that technique hundreds of years ago.   The TM people use it for \"Siddhis\".\n\nAnd each time you do it, you learn how to drop the thought and return to silence more easily.\n\nYou can get so good at it you are sitting there materializing things for an hour, continuously.\n\nIf you wanted to \"specialize\", you could even materialize some wadded up dollar bills, then materialize an exotic dancer, and toss her a bill.\n\nOf course as you did that, the women would be taken over by an inorganic being.\n\nIt's a path to gaining an Ally, using the Simple Silence technique.\n\nAnother is to watch for light. I prefer whitish yellow for this particular technique.\n\nIn perfect silence you gaze at the whitish light until it's stable, and then you \"fan\" it with your gaze.\n\nMake it spin.\n\nNow this may seem random, but I believe it will always work for anyone.  Once you learn how to \"fan\" it with your gaze. Which simply means, get it to return enough times to become familiar with it, and stop being thrilled it even showed up.\n\nIt opens up into a tunnel into the inorganic being's realm, and one comes to the border to take a look at you.\n\nVery, very frightening the first time.", "edited": 1613668115.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gnwjit4", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it would be terribly hard to make a puffery simulator type game, but I have no idea how you would make that interesting. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ohh...

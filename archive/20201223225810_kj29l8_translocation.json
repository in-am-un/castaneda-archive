All of the things we do to move the assemblage point result in \"seeing energy on a horizon\".\n\nTranslocation is merely using that, to see another place.\n\nThe fact that you can surround yourself, is just a happy coincidence.  \n\nProbably you'll be so amazed, you won't even check that detail.\n\nUnless you do the zooming chair trick Lucy uses in that movie.\n\nIn that case, you might turn around to look.\n\nIn a dark room, you'll be focused just on what's in front.\n\nBut if you check to the side, you have a 50/50 chance it's also translocated to the same place.\n\nAnd yes, you can get it to happen on your hand!  Carlos used to do that in class to get answers.\n\nBut before you try to become the \"king of crib notes\", try to change locations until you can do it any evening you like.\n\nExcept I have to warn.  TRYING to do it, halts the process.\n\nIt's best, at first, to let it happen naturally.  Just play with stuff, until you've seen most of those in that picture.\n\nLearn what happens at which depth of the assemblage point.\n\nLearn what the breath change is like.\n\nThen, AFTER the breath changes, casually look to see if you have the whitish light on the walls.\n\nIf you do, crawl around looking at it on the floor, and even under the bed.\n\nOn the bedspread.\n\nBut don't concentrate, putting your fingers on your temples like Martin the Martian. You'll interfere.\n\nThink of it this way.  \n\nIt's raw energy. It needs you to add *intent*, to make it form into something.\n\nIf you start thinking, \"I want Disneyland, Disneyland, Disneyland!!!!\"\n\nForget it.  It'll quiver, and shake, and remain as it is.\n\nBut you could say, out loud, \"Disneyland is lovely this time of year.\"\n\nAnd then forget it.  Really forget it.

The assemblage point doesn't keep moving.\n\nIt's waiting for you to design some practical magic.\n\nDon't try that with translocation. At least, not for a long time.\n\nJuan might get this one.

About people making requests.  \n\nHomework I used to call it.\n\nNo one wants homework!\n\nBut it's more than that.\n\nSurrounded by amazing magic and passageways to other worlds, not to mention spirits trying to get my attention by giving me a show (you should have seen Fancy last night!!!!), I remembered something someone asked me to do for them.\n\nI could either do that, putting an end to all the magic (you can't change or your assemblage point moves to a different location), or I could keep learning more.\n\nSuch requests are always about something very difficult to do, which takes hours to prepare for.  So you lose far more than the average person could even imagine, if you do it.\n\nAnd such request are only made by people who know they'll never be willing to put in the work to learn it themselves.\n\nSo they aren't even useful to restoring the reputation of Carlos.\n\nIt's like asking someone to drive to Arizona from LA and bring you back one of those funny cactuses, so that they can decide if it's worth the trip themselves.\n\nThe biggest request I get is to ask Cholita to video tape her levitating a plate.\n\nMyself I don't care, because I see things levitate all the time.  Just can't do it myself.\n\nFortunately, Cholita is insane so I don't have to ask her. \n\nShe'd pick up her expensive laptop (which I've had to replace 2 times), and smash it over my head.  So I'd have to replace it again.\n\nAnd, there's already videos like that on Youtube.  They don't make any difference.\n\nThere's really nothing to gain by proving things, unless you're hoping for a book deal.\n\nAnyone hoping for a book deal won't be able to do it.\n\nTheir internal dialogue is too noisy.\n\nOn the other hand, if you get used to it, and don't think about it anymore, you get to walk into those places, right through the walls.  I did that just last night.\n\nDidn't even recall it until just now, because when you can do something like that, you're as innocent as a toddler.    You don't know any better.  So there's nothing unusual going on.\n\nBut even a hint of \"man, if I could just put an IR camera in here to record what's going on...\"\n\nWill stop it from happening.\n\nThe solidity of the world is based on what you are thinking about it.\n\nIt's not that there are \"magic fairies\" who become offended if you try to prove something.\n\nNot at all!\n\nFancy in fact smiles each time I tell her she's \"famous on the internet\".  She's all for getting herself attention.\n\nIt's yourself that stops it.  Or better put, your \"self\".\n\nThere's a reason you can't do it. And the reason is pretty much the same as wanting to prove it, in some odd way.\n\nIf you are obsessed with the self (everyone is 100% that way), you are solid. \n\nAnd you cannot violate the laws of physics.", "edited": 1610141342.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gil2tfr", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll have to learn it yourself if you want to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t imagine anyone being willing to get involved in a thing like trying to prove something they do nightly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was pondering this last night.  About people making requests.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Homework I used to call it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one wants homework!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s more than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Surrounded by amazing magic and passageways to other worlds, not to mention spirits trying to get my attention by giving me a show (you should have seen Fancy last night!!!!), I remembered something someone asked me to do for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could either do that, putting an end to all the magic (you can&amp;#39;t change or your assemblage point moves to a different location), or I could keep learning more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such requests are always about something very difficult to do, which takes hours to prepare for.  So you lose far more than the average person could even imagine, if you do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And such request are only made by people who know they&amp;#39;ll never be willing to put in the work to learn it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they aren&amp;#39;t even useful to restoring the reputation of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like asking someone to drive to Arizona from LA and bring you back one of those funny cactuses, so that they can decide if it&amp;#39;s worth the trip themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest request I get is to ask Cholita to video tape her levitating a plate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myself I don&amp;#39;t care, because I see things levitate all the time.  Just can&amp;#39;t do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Cholita is insane so I don&amp;#39;t have to ask her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;d pick up her expensive laptop (which I&amp;#39;ve had to replace 2 times), and smash it over my head.  So I&amp;#39;d have to replace it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, there&amp;#39;s already videos like that on Youtube.  They don&amp;#39;t make any difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s really nothing to gain by proving things, unless you&amp;#39;re hoping for a book deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone hoping for a book deal won&amp;#39;t be able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their internal dialogue is too noisy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you get used to it, and don&amp;#39;t think about it anymore, you get to walk into those places, right through the walls.  I did that just last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t even recall it until just now, because when you can do something like that, you&amp;#39;re as innocent as a toddler.    You don&amp;#39;t know any better.  So there&amp;#39;s nothing unusual going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even a hint of &amp;quot;man, if I could just put an IR camera in here to record what&amp;#39;s going on...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will stop it from happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The solidity of the world is based on what you are thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that there are &amp;quot;magic fairies&amp;quot; who become offended if you try to prove something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not at all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy in fact smiles each time I tell her she&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;famous on the internet&amp;quot;.  She&amp;#39;s all for getting herself attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s yourself that stops it.

Maybe even, only in dreaming awake.\n\nSo it's not like you can go to \"used energy body junk  yard\", find one, and measure things.\n\nI'll try to duplicate exactly what I see at the end, so you all know it's worth wiggling those fingers, just as Zuleica said.\n\nBut also, so you all know how very difficult it is to pin such things down.\n\nPlease notice from the 3 quotes I found in the books, that either Hermalinda had never \"seen\" it herself, or she was playing dumb for Carlos.\n\nBut my guess would be, a \"precise\" sight like Juan gave, is a male thing.\n\nAfterall, this stuff is kind of a phantom construct of the old seers.\n\nTo assume it's just another copy of our standard reality, but \"over there\" is what beginners do.\n\nAnd if you took a child the way the old seers did, a \"youngling\" to teach as an apprentice, you could come up with many other sights to see, that would be your energy body.\n\nStill, I'd like to depict it as close to what's in all places in the books, that it can be.\n\nAnd then maybe that will motivate people to actually learn to see it themselves?\n\nIn some ways, these cartoons are a \"trick\".\n\nNot in a bad way!\n\nA few of the advanced have figured it out.\n\nIf we can just get the inventory experts arguing about details this small, it's a lot better than when they were insisting they're the most impeccable person around.\n\nAnything REAL, is better than the crummy make believe our Castaneda fan community got stuck with for 50 years!\n\nThat's the trick.  You don't realize, you're now treating it \"as real\".\n\nRule #2 of darkroom:  If you treat something that can't possibly be there as real, the assemblage point shifts sideways to make it more so.\n\nOf course, you still need to be able to execute rule #1:  If you gaze in silence in darkness at anything \"that can't possibly be there\", the assemblage point moves down along the J curve.\n\nBut Rule #2 alone is better than nothing.\n\nRule #1 is too much work for most people.\n\n\\*\\*\\* The quotes I already have \\*\\*\\*\n\nSorcerers consider the assemblage point to be the place where the flow of direct energy is turned into sensory data and interpreted as the world of everyday life. Don Juan said that the assemblage point, aside from doing all this, also has a most important secondary function: it is the linking connection between the physical body and the assemblage point of the energy body. He described such a connection as being analogous to two magnetized circles, each the size of a tennis ball, coming together, attracted by forces of intent.\n\nHe also said that when the physical body and the energy body are not joined, the connection between them is an ethereal line, which sometimes is so tenuous that it seems not to exist. Don Juan was certain that the energy body is pushed farther and farther away as one grows older, and that death comes as the result of the severance of that tenuous connection.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHermelinda had understood that all the points were in our physical body, but Juan Tuma explained that since the luminous body is quite big, some of the points are as much as three feet away from the physical body.\n\nIn a sense they are outside of us, and yet they are not. They are on the periphery of our luminosity and thus still belong to the total body.\n\nThe most important of those points is located a foot away from the stomach, 40 degrees to the right of an imaginary line shooting straight forward.\n\nJuan Tuma told us that point was a center of assembling for the second attention; and that it is possible to manipulate it by gently stroking the air with the palms of the hands.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nZuleica must have seen what I was going through. She suddenly began to explain that the second attention belongs to the luminous body, just as the first attention belongs to the physical body. She said that the point where the second attention assembles itself was situated right where Juan Tuma had described it the first time we met- approximately one and one-half feet in front of the midpoint between the stomach and the belly button and four inches to the right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "WANTED: Energy Body Quotes!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Illustrations"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"uutjsuv6nwib1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uutjsuv6nwib1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5019ed22d966fc9061b4aaf1778d1bf1392b1693"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uutjsuv6nwib1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebb49077c2cf92b5f7e59a8b40a425241860ad17"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uutjsuv6nwib1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e0af75bcb708f8eaffe8e4256533a019b4817b0"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uutjsuv6nwib1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e70a30ed3fe10a117311182a2fd090428157df5"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uutjsuv6nwib1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc31558019e30f2be71b487e2be6e8963238f066"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uutjsuv6nwib1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=549ae6864bf4cc535d8a0e18fd93f0a67e9e522c"}], "s": {"y": 720, "x": 1280, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/uutjsuv6nwib1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e61bc2c46ee802642b0c955ec689040babffb570"}, "id": "uutjsuv6nwib1"}}, "name": "t3_15urbhv", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Illustrations", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/UZtPk4yLaoT6vL738Yy72EqcGSprjUIot35KHgMGT3g.jpg", "edited": 1692383063.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1692380977.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/uutjsuv6nwib1.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e61bc2c46ee802642b0c955ec689040babffb570\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/uutjsuv6nwib1.jpg?width=1280&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e61bc2c46ee802642b0c955ec689040babffb570&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was trying to add the &amp;quot;blue ball of energy&amp;quot; body to my Luminous Sphere animation, to settle once and for all how much Man&amp;#39;s band angles in the egg.

I've had enough experience with it to see that's so.\n\nHowever, expect it to take HUNDREDS of hours.\n\nLook at the timeline and comments in the \"Eagle's Gift\" book and you'll come to 200-800 hours, based on all night long and how many days he was hanging out there (in weeks as I recall).\n\nBut, the good news is that wiggling the fingers is very entertaining once you can see and feel that point.\n\nAnd, it comes with a \"secret\" I won't reveal.\n\nWhich doesn't require you to wiggle the fingers for all that long.\n\nExcept it's hit or miss if you get that \"bonus\".\n\nA single deliberate visit by Cholita in my vicinity during darkroom is worth 10 of that bonus.\n\n\\&gt;from the moment the body learns to make that **dent**, **it is easier to enter into dreaming**.\n\nI believe, our situation is slightly different.\n\nCarlos got the Nagual's blow before visiting with Zuleica.\n\nHe was in Heightened Awareness, if not right on the border of Silent Knowledge!\n\nGood thing, because he'd have gotten super bored otherwise.  Wiggling his fingers all night, or sitting back to back with La Gorda just listening for 8 hours, and for several days.\n\nIn our case, we're following the \"Tensegrity path\" into the second attention.\n\nCarlos even called it that somewhere that I ran across recently.\n\nThe difference is, following the Tensegrity path we get to bring out our double and then discover \"the abstract\".\n\nCarlos even told us that would happen!\n\nAnd the abstract is also a way to go into dreaming directly from awake.\n\nThere's an argument to be made that \"womb dreaming\" utilizes the abstract!\n\nHinted at when don Juan turned Taisha down on power plants, saying she \"was already there\".\n\nAnd elsewhere either he or one of the senior members of his lineage said that women start out in the abstract already.\n\n\\&gt;But in the apprentices' case, because they did not have a Nagual leader, the depression was created from the outside and was a permanent feature of their luminous bodies, a great help but also a hindrance. It made all of them vulnerable and moody.\n\nSo the second attention dent is something kind of new?\n\nI sure wish we could blame the moodiness of new people who visit the subreddit on that dent.\n\nThen we could kick it as needed, instead of exploding their heads.\n\n\\&gt;I thought that the **dent** **was** **at the height of the upper portion of the outside of their right thigh, or perhaps just at the crest of their hipbone**.\n\nI should probably show this in that video also, but it comes out to the same height within 2 inches.\n\nSo if someone discovers it in the books thinking it's a \"gotcha\" (some don't like the videos), they'll instead find it agrees.\n\nBut while we're at it, everyone should just feel their hip bone top, and look at that new video where Juan Tuma and Zuleica's heights are shown.\n\nThey agree closely enough!\n\nEspecially since that assemblage point is the size of a tennis ball. Meaning, if you miss wiggling on the perfect spot by 2 inches, you'll still be hitting that point!\n\nSorcery is amazingly consistent.  I remember when bad people were criticizing the new books starting after \"Tales of Power\", saying Carlos just added a bunch of new stuff.\n\nNOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH!\n\nHe just explained more aspects of it, but nothing at all changed.\n\nThose same people tended to say that he was \"stealing\" from idiotic sources like Dzogchen!\n\nCome on...

Wiggling his fingers all night, or sitting back to back with La Gorda just listening for 8 hours, and for several days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our case, we&amp;#39;re following the &amp;quot;Tensegrity path&amp;quot; into the second attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos even called it that somewhere that I ran across recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The difference is, following the Tensegrity path we get to bring out our double and then discover &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos even told us that would happen!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the abstract is also a way to go into dreaming directly from awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an argument to be made that &amp;quot;womb dreaming&amp;quot; utilizes the abstract!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hinted at when don Juan turned Taisha down on power plants, saying she &amp;quot;was already there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And elsewhere either he or one of the senior members of his lineage said that women start out in the abstract already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;But in the apprentices&amp;#39; case, because they did not have a Nagual leader, the depression was created from the outside and was a permanent feature of their luminous bodies, a great help but also a hindrance. It made all of them vulnerable and moody.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the second attention dent is something kind of new?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sure wish we could blame the moodiness of new people who visit the subreddit on that dent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then we could kick it as needed, instead of exploding their heads.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;I thought that the &lt;strong&gt;dent&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;at the height of the upper portion of the outside of their right thigh, or perhaps just at the crest of their hipbone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should probably show this in that video also, but it comes out to the same height within 2 inches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if someone discovers it in the books thinking it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;gotcha&amp;quot; (some don&amp;#39;t like the videos), they&amp;#39;ll instead find it agrees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But while we&amp;#39;re at it, everyone should just feel their hip bone top, and look at that new video where Juan Tuma and Zuleica&amp;#39;s heights are shown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They agree closely enough!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially since that assemblage point is the size of a tennis ball. Meaning, if you miss wiggling on the perfect spot by 2 inches, you&amp;#39;ll still be hitting that point!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcery is amazingly consistent.  I remember when bad people were criticizing the new books starting after &amp;quot;Tales of Power&amp;quot;, saying Carlos just added a bunch of new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He just explained more aspects of it, but nothing at all changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those same people tended to say that he was &amp;quot;stealing&amp;quot; from idiotic sources like Dzogchen!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Come on...

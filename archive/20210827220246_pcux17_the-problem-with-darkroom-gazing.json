New people might think that's an exaggeration, but just wait until you get to the orange zone, your breath changes, and suddenly you aren't impressed by Zen masters.\n\nYou're now enlightened (for a while), know how to get there,  and your internal dialogue no longer controls your moods.\n\nAnd you watch new people come in here with a mixture of sympathy, and fear they'll strike out at any moment.\n\nThey're a little like stray dogs who have been abused.\n\nAnd if you try to touch that pitiful bone they're carrying, your hand is in danger.\n\nBut, all we can do is give people a chance, and see who works hard.\n\nWe don't extract money from people, so we can't care if someone is unable to learn.\n\nIf we had an \"organization\" (fat guru) to support, we might have to modify our techniques, making them unworkable anymore, for producing real magic.  But there would be bills to pay if we had an organization, so what are you going to do?  You have to sacrifice magic, to compromise on how difficult it is.\n\nGuru Dev is used to a certain life style.\n\nBut are you in the clear once they drop the bone, get hosed off a bit, realize that being a stray dog isn't all that fun, and get to work?  And then, actually get a taste of real magic?\n\nWell... As far as the purpose I had for coming here, yes.\n\nAll I wanted to do was restore the reputation of Carlos so that after I'm dead, people who find the books, and wonder it it's true, will see on the web that yes, it works.\n\nInstead of seeing what was there just a year ago. Nothing  but bad news.  Carlos was a fraud. He's been debunked. He was a pervert, feeding drugs to hapless stray women for money.\n\nAnd too \"short\" to be a guru.  A guru should be high of stature.\n\nI believe, we've fixed that.  Although the skeptical among us still will say, \"but anyone can see anything at all, if they just work themselves up into a frenzy!\"\n\nMan, I wish I could find THAT party.  I've never seen it.\n\nNo one has. In fact, you can't see anything you like, or the entire world would spend all of their time in the bathroom.\n\nFor any reasonable person, we've proven all of what Carlos wrote does work,  if you just follow instructions.\n\nBut, some will insist, \"Ok, hallucinating is fine, but can you teleport?  Can you scare the dickens out of your best friend, using your IOB?  Can you fly like don Juan???\"\n\nSo, we have to keep rowing.\n\nAnd it's going to take a full ship to get as far as we need to, before the skeptics give up and admit they were wrong.\n\nProblem is, many who said they wanted magic actually wanted human company.\n\nThey need the workshop hugs.  The workshop affairs.  Workshop sex behind the bushes.\n\nCult orgies.\n\nAll that fun stuff.\n\nAnd we don't have any.\n\nI don't know how you can fix that.  If you figured out how to set all that up, no one would learn anymore.\n\nIt's hard enough to learn on your own.

What you need is no internal dialogue.\n\nWhich is easier to attain without any distractions around.\n\nBut in fact, I learned \"darkroom\" from Little Smoke and Devil's Weed, who chased me across Asia, in terror. Carlos had introduced us in private classes, when it was clear he wouldn't survive much longer.\n\nWhen they were done I was seeing the puff balls that Tensegrity manipulates,  in full daylight.\n\nBut they were clearly much nicer in darkness.\n\nAnd then Little Smoke returned, to show me a more elaborate version of that movement from \"Unbending Intent Long Form\", where you jump up and grab a puff, and place it on the 3 energy pouches.\n\nHer \"Technique\" consisted of flying over to a place that had a fairly strong puff hanging out in the air, so that I could scoop that one up, and place it on a pouch.\n\nWith the goal of \"clearing the room\" of puffs.\n\nWhat's the point you ask?\n\nAh... It's an evil trick.\n\nBut not one I created.  Carlos gave it to us in the Tensegrity.\n\nAnd if you read all of the workshop and lecture notes, and his final publications, you'll see that Carlos wasn't bound by darkness.\n\nExcept, he got \"zapped\" into what he could do, by an entire lineage.\n\nWe don't have one.\n\nSo while Little Smoke could also \"zap\" me to see the puffs in full daylight, that hasn't happened in all of the time since Carlos was gone.\n\nNo one saw the puffs.\n\nKylie once saw Phoebus, while doing tensegrity with Reni and Nyei.\n\nAnd I can 80% assure you, Phoebus was a \"puff hijacker\".\n\nThe inorganic beings materialize visibly for us, by invoking our own silent knowledge.\n\nThat's always been what they do. They bridge the gap between a stupid Man of Knowledge who never learned to see, and silent knowledge around 6 feet more movement along the J curve.\n\nThey stand in the middle, and channel silent knowledge to shaman types who use drugs to move their assemblage point, and a ritual to feel that they \"deserve it\".\n\nBut the talking lizards, were actually just silent knowledge in a bizarre presentation form.\n\nSo when Kylie was doing tensegrity at Pandora and saw Phoebus (and ran screaming from what I heard), Phoebus was almost  surely just a projection onto a piece of Kylie's energy body, floating around from her doing tensegrity.\n\nAgain, Kylie got \"zapped\" by the allies of Taisha.\n\nWhich I suppose means, if you already have an ally, then daylight Tensegrity might work much better to produce visible results.\n\nBut any advantage you can get is useful.\n\nAnd in the end it's just an \"evil trick\" as I said.\n\nA trick to lure your energy body off the sides of your egg, to come into the center and collect into a blue ball of energy, there.\n\nWhich you WILL SEE!!!\n\nWe don't mess around in sorcery.\n\nThere's no \"sacred scrolls\" only for those who live in the high mountains of Tibet.  Who also, by the way, believe there's someone living elsewhere who can actually do what they lie, and claim to do.\n\nThey're no different than any of their followers. They just got \"promoted\" for good fund raising abilities.\n\nThere's no \"Guru Dev\" miracles we have to listen to, with very little hope to ever do that ourselves. And then merely worship that man as a substitute for what he promised you in the first place.\n\nTo get your money.\n\nThere's absolutely no point at all to sorcery unless you make it work!\n\nJust look around at all the very ugly pretend warriors writing mentally ill books, so they can steal from the community.\n\nThe \"mood of a warrior\" is repulsive in our community.\n\nDoesn't look good on anyone.\n\nBut MAGIC.  Real magic.\n\nThat's always good to see.\n\nDoes this mask work?\n\nI have no idea. Reddit put up the ad, in the castaneda subreddit.\n\nIt does say \"blackout\"!\n\nAnd it doesn't press against the eyes.\n\nAnd in fact, you can learn to see the puffs under normal conditions.\n\nEven in full sunlight.\n\nI just never heard of anyone doing that at a workshop, so I'm assuming it's much easier to learn in absolute darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sia Silk Mask", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/b061bb3a-9e7f-4aa9-aa7a-e852027799a8", "link_ids": ["t3_ufe5n7", "t3_uqjb1b", "t3_v0blwa", "t3_vet0rc", "t3_vj02xm", "t3_vl5y3u", "t3_vljtnc", "t3_vofz7z", "t3_vskr8w", "t3_vw90yz", "t3_w06vvt", "t3_w0ef1w", "t3_w4ku1c", "t3_w69oc4", "t3_wtav5p", "t3_wzr75t", "t3_x08z4q", "t3_x394xi", "t3_x5hqin", "t3_xiqr6m", "t3_xqg5yk", "t3_yb5su0", "t3_yntpxe", "t3_yzvbf2", "t3_z29k0l", "t3_yzfldm", "t3_z6na2c", "t3_zbtriz", "t3_zuotse", "t3_zuck9m", "t3_zxxeke", "t3_zycipg", "t3_10cnn2l", "t3_10lm2xt", "t3_10og6ip", "t3_10st3r0", "t3_10t7r08", "t3_10tlqmo", "t3_112wgv2", "t3_11a9k43", "t3_11b31re", "t3_11mk18w", "t3_11mrueg", "t3_11ukc7r", "t3_11x2mm6", "t3_137rsam", "t3_13ink97", "t3_13sgu3u", "t3_13vt16r", "t3_146ari6", "t3_14hgshp", "t3_14n3guj", "t3_14nzehw", "t3_14rbo3d", "t3_159f5xc", "t3_15epoo9", "t3_15ivrij", "t3_15mmpi9", "t3_161dw6x", "t3_16tme3p", "t3_16vhq77", "t3_17hp09f", "t3_1892kzi", "t3_18d01eh", "t3_1aevm5d", "t3_1aflfh4", "t3_1aj65ur", "t3_1awevc6", "t3_1ayafsg", "t3_1b51fqk", "t3_1b88jgx", "t3_1bhyfsq"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 3", "created_at_utc": 1651408248.875, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "b061bb3a-9e7f-4aa9-aa7a-e852027799a8", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1714464584.911, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 114, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"7ncpil57b69b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 88, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7ncpil57b69b1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c676109ddd2c5829a6521c42fb8536e32028a15"}, {"y": 176, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7ncpil57b69b1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b28537dba57e60c3f0c8edaa1393995b2e3a0da"}, {"y": 260, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7ncpil57b69b1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85fc8ed0a1995bdd8395f1942e1f8d30db9181bb"}, {"y": 521, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7ncpil57b69b1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c9c35b1ac698165c5e57af1ae5b9a362f3cb035"}, {"y": 782, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7ncpil57b69b1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33bd429210488774bf19149151555605eafd0201"}, {"y": 880, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7ncpil57b69b1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4ba908b6b922df8e8701b83c3203a0730fc3bc4"}], "s": {"y": 1395, "x": 1711, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/7ncpil57b69b1.jpg?width=1711&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7974b8dabcd7448a76e65a79fc7c56430bcc9ef"}, "id": "7ncpil57b69b1"}}, "name": "t3_14n3guj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 21, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 21, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Skp45K9TxA8zGtZO3pHiJHiEXkNU6Vv221W2UoT2l5A.jpg", "edited": 1688140614.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1688138761.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7ncpil57b69b1.jpg?width=1711&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c7974b8dabcd7448a76e65a79fc7c56430bcc9ef\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/7ncpil57b69b1.jpg?width=1711&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c7974b8dabcd7448a76e65a79fc7c56430bcc9ef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reddit&amp;#39;s promotions came up with an ad for this.

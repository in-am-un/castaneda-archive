It's very scary when it's perfectly real.  \n\n\nBetter when it's mostly just telepathic and pantomime.  \n\n\nI was holding Fairy in my hand one time, and wondered what she had under that short skirt.  \n\n\nSo she raised it up for me!  \n\n\nThey're like Star Trek \"too good to be true aliens\", who never heard of sex or kissing before.

Become \"experts\" on enlightenment for example.\n\nWhich might work a tiny bit with some forms of meditation, but it harms you with sorcery.\n\nBecause each idea in your mind, sends you down a different path.\n\nAnd you won't find the one back to the Olmecs.\n\nYou'll purse sorcery, but you won't get any help from *intent*.\n\nSo where you end up won't be worth all the work.\n\nThe best thing you can do to learn sorcery, is forget everything everyone out there is teaching, about magic and enlightenment.\n\nIt's all harmful to learning sorcery.\n\nAt first, it's hard to see what I'm talking about, but later you'll realize some of what you read or heard,  contributed to a bad understanding of what you are trying to learn with sorcery.\n\nSo someone who's done lots of Astral Travel for example, is ruined for learning sorcery.\n\nIt's so filled with bad explanations, you'll never get those out of your mind long enough to see the real thing, so that you keep going.\n\nThey typically just get angry, because others won't recognize their \"accomplishments\".

Basically wherever I looked in the room a dream would form I could see vast landscapes and strange people in there. I wanted to get a closer look to solidify the details but it&amp;#39;s like your flying with no control and can&amp;#39;t stop to long on one scene.

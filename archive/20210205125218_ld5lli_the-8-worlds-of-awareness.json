But we don&amp;#39;t have specific info on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But where do the other 40 fit in???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; So one of the thing we get to know about these worlds is that they operate on different time scales.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Man, good reasoning.  You should program computers! There&amp;#39;s a lot of very obvious things in the books, but people get obsessed with hunting for lizards, or honoring &amp;quot;don Juan&amp;#39;s memory&amp;quot; by being &amp;quot;impeccable&amp;quot;, and don&amp;#39;t think about the bulk of all of the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They get a book deal going in their mind, and ignore anything that doesn&amp;#39;t fit with that narrow minded view, which holds them together emotionally in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos left little &amp;quot;clues&amp;quot; in there, or &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; did, and it&amp;#39;s going to take a larger community of &amp;quot;thinkers&amp;quot; to dig them out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; This was the world that Carlos needed to shift his AP to in order to survive the jump into the abyss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he cheated by passing between worlds?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why couldn&amp;#39;t you use a friendly IOB world to do that? I spend a long time in those at night.  Seems pretty safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s almost so common place, I&amp;#39;ll look up from what I&amp;#39;m doing, see Fancy&amp;#39;s ice cave, and nod to a creature sticking out of a wall in there, &amp;quot;Hey Bob.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then go back to what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I meen the world with the tunnels, in &amp;quot;the art of dreaming&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol Tiggs pushed me in there.  In private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I literally fell right through the wooden floor, and into a dirt tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been back there several times since, and could probably even find it on purpose, if it seemed worth visiting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Twice I got an elaborate history lesson there.

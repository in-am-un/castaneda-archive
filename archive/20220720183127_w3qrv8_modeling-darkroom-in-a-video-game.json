Free to use, open source code, written by the Dutch.\n\nCurse those Dutch!!!  They're everywhere drinking their warm beer, and planning to enrich the world with free open source software.\n\nI'm not sure which is worse.  A mercenary Russian programmer helping China take over the world, or the Dutch trying to make it a \"better place\".\n\nBUT, they do make cool stuff.  Like \"Python\".\n\nBlender not only can run native Python for each \"object\" in the cartoon, but it can simulate particle physics.\n\nSo that as part of learning to be an \"Active Audience\", we can create more stuff that goes along with the stuff Carlos gave us.  Without actually modifying any of it.\n\nIt's just a cartoon of what he already gave us in story form!\n\nA cartoon of Dance Home for example, where Carlos taught private classes.\n\nA cartoon Carlos who looks suspiciously like Cantinflas, the Jerry Lewis of Mexico. Minus the cheesy northern Mexico moustache.\n\nAnd a version of Kylie, with precise bone structure (easy to copy a pic into a 3D cartoon), but maybe at age 18 so no one complains.\n\nMake a perfect copy of Dance Home, down to the floorboards.  I mean, literally. The exact pattern on the wooden floors.\n\nEasy to do!\n\nAnd with a ladder leading to the roof, so you can do \"Gift to Maui\" on the roof, or \"Stellar Hatch\".  With a couple of private class students up there in the shadows, smoking.\n\nThen program the pretend Kylie to do the tensegrity forms, but let the person watching change the angle and perspective on the fly. It's 3D!\n\nYou can even pretend to be a \"Carol Tiggs\" fly on her shoulder, and see what she's seeing while doing the moves.\n\nAdd in the \"puffs\", and you have \"virtual sorcery\".\n\nCourtesy of the Dutch!\n\nWhile trying to create \"puffs\" that have crystalline edges if you move your eyes closer to them, and hold still, you have to \"define\" how they behave.\n\nWe don't know if that will be universal, but we can alter it with time, so that you get choices.\n\n\"Dan Eyes\"\n\n\"Juann Eyes\"\n\nAnd so on.\n\nPeople can \"get an idea\" what others are seeing.\n\nAnd over time we'll gain more information.\n\nWill we \"taint\" everyone?\n\nYep.\n\nBut that's better than what we had before, where everyone was tainted with \"Carlos went bad\",  \"Carlos was thoroughly debunked\", and \"Carlos was just a big pervert.\"\n\nTainted with \"everyone sees the same kind of stuff\" is much better than \"No one has ever seen any magic from that crap!\"\n\nIt'll also break the hearts of Dzogchen everywhere. And they richly deserve that!\n\nThe Dali Lama himself might end up playing the game, while he asks Tony what the hell is going on with those guys?\n\nYou can even put a little \"J Curve\" slider in the corner of the animation scene, and people can drag that along the J curve to see the same scene from the other depths of the assemblage point.\n\nThe \"Active Audience\".\n\nI think that's US, if we want it to be.\n\nI might even be able to drag an old surviving Olmec seer into the mix, and get his \"corrections\".\n\nTo see how they perceived it.\n\nAnd if I'm super lucky, one of those \"ancient seers\" who hadn't even learned to speak yet.\n\nBut the point of this post is, while trying to figure out how to make the puffs \"glow\" I discovered that they glow \"too much\", for their apparent luminosity.\n\nThey're almost like a 40 watt light bulb, illuminating the surrounds as if they were 150 watts.\n\nThey don't obey standard laws of physics.\n\nBut they DO obey some other laws.\n\nWe can figure those out.\n\nThe Dutch didn't cleverly think of everything we could ever need for this.\n\nInstead they just \"quantized\" every aspect of reality that pertains to making realistic cartoons, and gave them \"slider bars\" to control the amount or volume of the effect.\n\nAnd being Dutch, they probably giggled in their beer, as they allowed the slider bars to be 1 million times too much for the actual real world effect they represent.\n\nThis picture is not a good attempt at showing \"puff glow\".\n\nJust something to think about so you know what I'm looking at using \"Blender\".\n\nA well made \"video game\" would let you pick ANY tensegrity pass from all of them, and get Kylie to do that for you.\n\nNo more, \"That's not a good angle to be doing it from.\"\n\nThen \"when available\", you could see how it would look to an advanced darkroom person.\n\nThe magic it creates.\n\nWe're the \"Active Audience\".\n\nSomething that comes after the lineages end.\n\nBlender makes animations, not video games.\n\nBut there's software to easily let you run around your cartoons, using a joystick.\n\nCurse those Dutch people!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

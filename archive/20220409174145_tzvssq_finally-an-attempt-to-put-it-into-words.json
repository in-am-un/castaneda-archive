Or am I allowed to try putting this into very concise form (as within this post here)? Or should I rather not since this can invite bad players to pretend?\n\nAnyways, I will have a go.\n\n1. What our society calls a \"person\" is first of all just a physical body. First of all, that \"body\" is simply a \"space suit\", an \"avatar\", a \"meat suit\", nothing more. It has a \"rational\" mind and some emotions, these are \"low level features\". Now here is the point:\n2. That \"person\" may or may not have one / or several  / a fraction of a \"spirit\" attached to it (instead of \"spirit\" you could say \"entity\", \"IOB\", \"ghost\" etc. but do NOT say \"demon\" haha). Note that there is also the option of \"no\" spirit, and in that case, that \"avatar\" does NOT just shut down or die, but instead keeps on being a \"functioning zombie\". But \"nobody is home\".\n3. Sorcerers can, this almost with ease, switch from one \"avatar\" to another. This either temporarily or permanently. Yes, this IS true.\n4. Society will, most of the time, diagnose Avatars with \"multiple personality disorder\" or \"schizophrenia\" etc. They will wrongfully \"treat\" these poor Avatars who got \"diagnosed\" with horrible medication etc.\n5. There is no doubt in my mind that experienced sorcerers can even make the physical avatar \"disappear\" and transfer it to another \"dimension\". Maybe they \"like\" a particular sports car (= Avatar) and want to take it \"over\". That is also how the witches could have \"disappeared\".\n6. \"Who\" was Carlos Castaneda (rhetorical question)? Did Don Juan attach his own spirit to that particular person? Did Don Juan even exist in terms of a physical body? Does it matter? Who is Dan Lawton? Is \"he\" actually \"Carlos Castaneda\"? So does CC / DJ \"use\" DL's body as an avatar? Was \"DL\" a student of CC and CC used that Avatar at some point? Again, does it matter?\n7. Any \"scholar\" who emphasizes that he \"read all of Castaneda's books\" knows APESHIT. They can read all of the books 100 times, still they will NOT get it. It is the wrong way around. Someone who did not PRACTICE some sorcery will NOT understand a single sentence in any of the books on a deeper level. Haha. \n8. The techniques shown by CC and DL, such as stalking, recap, tensegrity, dreaming, dark room practice etc. are some of MANY other ones. These are proven techniques, but any sorcerer should really stay open-minded. You WILL find your own \"style\" and \"methods\" if you are serious about practicing sorcery. Either way, you CANNOT pretend. You can't. You cannot squeeze that eye ball (and you may see some \"colours\", such as the blood popping out!) and try to convince yourself that it is sorcery. You cannot take 30g of shrooms and reach master level (but guess what, this WILL damage your current Avatar if you try to \"trip\" every month). You NEED to go ALL the way to get to a high level, AND, then you need to push hard to STAY there!\n9. Sorcery is indeed technology. But what \"YOU\" / your \"team\" does with it, is on a whole other page! And guess what, it could be MORE important than the technology itself! I wish we would see more posts about that in this thread! And by the way, YES, it is ALL possible, you can travel to other dimensions, across time etc. It is no joke. This stuff IS real. And yes, you can even meet \"yourself\" while you are within your avatar (that is for another post).\n10. Humor is VERY important. More here need to realize that. It gives you that certain \"ease\" which will help you immensely on this path.\n11. Accepting to be a \"nobody\" is just the very beginning of it all, really. Because guess what, we all are \"nobodies\", just avatars who now and then get their spirit to \"come down\" and stay with us (however, sometimes also for pro-longed times).\n12. This here, is the COOLEST thing you can work on as a \"human\", PERIOD. YES, you WILL be able to have \"super powers\". However, your EGO will NOT get these, understand that point! If you come here and practice in order to become the \"richest man on the planet\" so you can boost your EGO, then, respectfully, FUCK OFF!!!!!!!!\n\nNow go for it folks (ANY comments welcome..........shoot \"me\" down, if you like. ;-))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy questions (will add others in the comment section):\n\nA. Is there actually a risk with regard to showing all this knowledge publicly? I mean in terms of any entities?\n\nB. Why was there so much talk here against \"channeling\"? Could you not use that word for when a spirit steers an avatar?

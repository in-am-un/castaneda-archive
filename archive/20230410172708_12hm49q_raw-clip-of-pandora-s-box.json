Sorry for Fairy's skirt flying up...](https://reddit.com/link/12hm49q/video/6mw6kr42s2ta1/player)\n\nThis is the raw output from the Smartsuit Pro MOCAP suit.\n\nNeeds editing currently beyond my ability.\n\nEasy to fix the issues, once you know iClone 8's animation editing software.\n\nOne of perhaps 12 software packages I've had to learn at least a little.\n\nThat one needs to be \"well known\" to fix the problems with this.\n\nHand misalignment for one.\n\nFairy's Skirt?  That's just a wind setting.  I have it too high.\n\nBut Fairy doesn't mind.\n\nFact is, the allies will take ANY form you desire.\n\nVisibly!  Hey beginners...\n\nWe don't fake magic in here. We don't \"visualize\" it, pretend it, sleep on it.\n\nIt's real, IN YOUR FACE magic.\n\nWhy I get lynched elsewhere for trying to interest people trapped in the pretend stuff, is a mystery to me.\n\nAlthough Kachora's Zombies are behind a lot of it, always trying to introduce the idea only the first 4 books are real, and that everyone would be convinced if we'd just show them don Juan.\n\nWho they want us to believe, is that fat profiteer Tata Kachora.\n\nBut watch out what you do with your Ally.\n\nI haven't had trouble with \"Fairy\", but my ally \"Fancy\" is a bad girl.\n\nAnd they have weird rules about what constitutes \"permission\" to kidnap you into their world.\n\nDon't steal from them being an odd one.  \n\nIf you steal, they get to steal you?\n\nI always refused to take what they put in my path, so I don't really know what happens if you take something from their realm.\n\nAnd don't falsely accuse them of stuff. \n\nThe way one of the chacmools accused them of taking those karate pictures of Taisha.\n\nI don't know what they do if you lie about them,  and harm their reputation.\n\nBut I DO KNOW, they like to be featured in social media.\n\nI suppose it makes them \"more real\" in our world.\n\nAnd if you stage truck accidents from a high freeway overpass above the tall forests north of Tokyo in Japan, where they die in a fiery crash over and over for your amusement, they might blow diesel smoke in your face if you try to \"Moth Dust\" trick.\n\nAllies are very fun, but you have to use \"common sense\" when dealing with them.\n\nJust like Cholita,  if you screw up they might take magical revenge.\n\nWe've been discussing what to do with the clips.\n\nIt comes down to, can we trust them to be preserved?\n\nTechno would probably like them posted here.\n\nBut I'd like to post them only to Jadey's feed, so we can monitor hits and see what's more popular.\n\nOnce there's all tensegrity moves and lots of cartoons, her channel might get some heavy traffic.\n\nOr not.\n\nSo here's what I'm thinking.\n\nRaw clips can go here. Just enough to learn the pass.\n\nFinished with special effects, on Jadey's page. We can link to that from all of our social media.\n\nExcept that instagram seems to clip the videos to a square size.\n\nI don't know if it does that on cell phones, but on PCs it's pretty bad clipping:\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq3C1K9M5QB/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq3C1K9M5QB/)\n\nI'll also put anything useful to people on Github, to protect it.\n\nChatGPT says it's unlikely Github is going away anytime in our lives.\n\nBut we'll keep a copyright on them to prevent profiteering.\n\nThe movements will go into Blender, with a single character to do them.\n\nAnyone can download that and make new videos.\n\n\"Only Carmela\" is what I was warned last night, gazing into the raw emanations.\n\nI seem to have picked  up a \"Cartoon Advisor\" from infinity.\n\nHas yet to take visible form.\n\nI just hope it isn't a stuttering Elmer Fudd.\n\nMaybe Bugs Bunny with a magical carrot to munch on would be nice?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Raw Clip of Pandora's Box", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"6mw6kr42s2ta1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/12hm49q/asset/6mw6kr42s2ta1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718050104%2CMGVhYzU3ZjcxOTE5YmFjODRkYmZiY2M3NGUzMDNjMWM4OGI0MzNmZGZlZWEzYmI2N2QwNmFiMTViYTQ3MTJiYQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 1296, "y": 1080, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/12hm49q/asset/6mw6kr42s2ta1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718050104%2CNDYxMDhmYmYwMjNiYmY0OWVlNGQ2YzEzNTc4Zjk3NjA2Mjk2YTRhMmVkNDhjMzc4YTkzNDMzNWI2NWUwZjBmYw%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "6mw6kr42s2ta1", "isGif": false}}, "name": "t3_12hm49q", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 20, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/4vTnjI4TFVZ_zIuvDRajwwtOLdcIY4ZIfvfwHizDjOE.jpg", "edited": 1681142171.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1681140428.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/12hm49q/video/6mw6kr42s2ta1/player\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s the raw clip.

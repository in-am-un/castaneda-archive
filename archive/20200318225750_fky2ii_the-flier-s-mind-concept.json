Relative to our progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Carlos prided himself on trying to fit us into the intent of his books, even giving weird names to the women, like Chacmool and Scout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let them lullaby you because as you know fliers mind does not have an opponent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its opponent is internal silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It leaves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worrying isn&amp;#39;t going to change that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you could specialize in trying to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos knew, someone like me would come along and say,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nope.  Haven&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he debunk-proofed it in his last books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan said ordinary people can actually see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That verified the photo could be snapped.

And he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then it took special actions by don Juan, to break some kind of membrane so that Carlos, who could already &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; at that point, could detect the flier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which debunk proofed it from my &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.

false, "body": "Whatever the thing is that hops on my bed every time I lay down to sleep, and hops off the bed upon waking up... it exactly what you describe.\n\nIt gets scared if I wake up abruptly, the other day it did this, I could feel it jump back while it was deep in some sort of dream manipulation, I could feel it's \"oh shit!!!!\" and then it darted off the bed.\n\nIt used to influence my thinking and probably still does, however, I've been skillfully watching my own internal dialogue and process for about the past 2 years.  One end result of this that I didn't intend is that my intuition has become sharper, as well as my telepathic ability and understanding.  I think it's just a natural result of paying attention to the internal workings though, nothing more.\n\nI'm confused on the difference between Inorganic Beings and Fliers...   aren't Fliers if not one and the same, just a type of IB's?\n\nI can also say I have felt this thing feeding off of me, so many times, it is undeniable.  One time when I employed a psychic vampire technique to feed off of it, and all of its cohorts (Because when I did this, it ended up being a barrage of 50 or more, and one bigger than all the others, like the main one).  I could feel them wiggling around like slugs.\n\nI sucked their energy dry and left them feeling like... empty vessels... it really felt gross, as I could distinctly feel them laying there... not dead, as all it takes is for people to put negative emotion or thought into the atmosphere to re-animate them.\n\nI remember where-as prior I could distinctly feel it had a sucker to siphon my energy about the size of a quarter.  After this episode it came back the next day, except this time it had one the size of a volleyball, and it was trying to feed with haste, like it knew it only had a short amount of time before I was aware and put a stop to it.\n\nThe energetic battle was more intense this time, if anyone has ever watched Dragon Ball Z, it was like 2 of them shooting their fireballs at each other and one of them is winning at one time, then losing at the other... except, instead of pushing energy out, it was pulling it in.\n\nI got scared for a moment that maybe I couldn't handle it, but then I reminded myself that I was in charge and losing was not an option, so I was able to step it up, before I took too much energy back, it just disconnected and hopped off the bed.  It's attempts for the night were over.\n\nAfter many of these sorts of battles, it seems to prefer the subtle approach towards me, tries to be sneaky and go unnoticed, but I can still sense it.  Also, since fear doesn't work on me, it uses sympathy and sometimes will manifest as one of my pets in a dream to try and get love out of me... but somehow I always realize something is off, and then I throw it down and it morphs, or I wake up upon the realization, inevitably I can feel it crawling off the bed, and again I wear ear plugs when I sleep, I can always hear it jumping off the bed with an inner-audible sound.\n\nAnyway, I have a daily reminder that indeed these things are real, I like the term \"Archon\" as that seems to have the most available info on the topic that can be found in what they are and how to deal with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:  I also want to add that years ago when I was under some sort of spiritual attack, I learned of the inner silence and starving them idea.  I can't remember if it was from Castaneda or Buddhism, probably Castaneda if it was presented as \"starving them out\", I do definitely distinctly remember going through it in meditation.

One end result of this that I didn&amp;#39;t intend is that my intuition has become sharper, as well as my telepathic ability and understanding.  I think it&amp;#39;s just a natural result of paying attention to the internal workings though, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m confused on the difference between Inorganic Beings and Fliers...   aren&amp;#39;t Fliers if not one and the same, just a type of IB&amp;#39;s?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can also say I have felt this thing feeding off of me, so many times, it is undeniable.  One time when I employed a psychic vampire technique to feed off of it, and all of its cohorts (Because when I did this, it ended up being a barrage of 50 or more, and one bigger than all the others, like the main one).  I could feel them wiggling around like slugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sucked their energy dry and left them feeling like... empty vessels... it really felt gross, as I could distinctly feel them laying there... not dead, as all it takes is for people to put negative emotion or thought into the atmosphere to re-animate them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember where-as prior I could distinctly feel it had a sucker to siphon my energy about the size of a quarter.  After this episode it came back the next day, except this time it had one the size of a volleyball, and it was trying to feed with haste, like it knew it only had a short amount of time before I was aware and put a stop to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The energetic battle was more intense this time, if anyone has ever watched Dragon Ball Z, it was like 2 of them shooting their fireballs at each other and one of them is winning at one time, then losing at the other... except, instead of pushing energy out, it was pulling it in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got scared for a moment that maybe I couldn&amp;#39;t handle it, but then I reminded myself that I was in charge and losing was not an option, so I was able to step it up, before I took too much energy back, it just disconnected and hopped off the bed.  It&amp;#39;s attempts for the night were over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After many of these sorts of battles, it seems to prefer the subtle approach towards me, tries to be sneaky and go unnoticed, but I can still sense it.

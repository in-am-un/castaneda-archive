Our magic is reality manipulation magic.\n\nSo it requires the ability to manipulate reality the same way, while not using the normal flow of time and space.\n\nOther pretend magical systems aren't like that at all, and their pretend magic is described like something you can discover or learn or purchase.\n\nAnd then there's no more work involved.\n\nThat's a false view of things.\n\nHowever, it's close enough to the real thing that it won't stop you from learning as long as you practice regularly.\n\nTo do something repeatedly,  and reliably, you need to find the same position of the assemblage point you had the last time.\n\nSo you need to \"play with it\" daily, to move to that position over and over until your body \"learns\" it.  \n\nTherein lies the danger of the red zone.\n\nOnce you \"learn\" that assemblage point position, then when you escape the blue zone and are moving your assemblage point rapidly along the J curve, it'll \"stop\" at that spot you learned for a few seconds.\n\nIt's like your mom becoming friends with the neighbors.\n\nAs a little kid in a hurry to get to the the park and play soccer, it's not really an advantage for your mom to be friends with the neighbors.\n\nBecause when you hurry out of the house to head for the park, she keeps being stopped to chat, by the neighbors she's made friends with.\n\nAnd 2 seconds delay moving through the red zone on the J curve,  is enough time to prevent \"burning from within\".\n\nThat's all that being \"trapped in the shift below\" really means.\n\nYou messed up your ability to use what we know about reaching the 3rd attention while alive.\n\nBut that's no longer our path anyway. Carlos found a new path to immortality.\n\nThus playing around in the red zone is possibly not as bad anymore as it was in the lineages.\n\nAnd you can see from the Olmec figurines that the old seers knew how to shapeshift into werejaguars. It seemed to be their \"thing\".\n\nRepeatable magic.\n\nWhich is pretty much no different than any other magic you can do in the red zone.  \n\nEven if it seems to be different.\n\nThe same reason you can shapeshift into a Jaguar, is the reason you can leap through outer space in your physical body.\n\nAnd if during your practicing you can't do that thing again, which you are trying to repeat, you just keep trying anyway.\n\nWhat you have to do to repeat a given magical effect,  is very specific to how you practice. And how that happened.\n\nFor instance if you manufactured a clown car on the floor, something I've done while exploring size shapeshifting, producing a realistic looking small car with doors that open, and you did that by manipulating a puff of purple that was particularly bright, you need to do that each night.\n\nIntending to bring the clown car back.\n\nTo the point that you might even get a bit superstitious about what needs to be done, if you hope to repeat something.\n\nNow you're \"messing with intent\" to overcome how dirty our links to it really ar.\n\nThe ritual kind of \"cleans up\" our link to that one specific thing.\n\nFor example, maybe you had lamb steaks for dinner on the night you succeeded.\n\nSo you include that was \"possibly\" necessary to succeed.\n\nOr maybe you wore your red socks, so the tensegrity was easier on a wooden floor.  And red were the only ones that were clean that night.\n\nWhich then gives you the idea that red socks might have helped.\n\nSo each night you have a lamb steak, put on the red socks, and try to repeat that magic.\n\nThat's how \"Man of Knowledge\" rituals were created.\n\nSome of their magical rituals, to get a very specific thing to happen for a customer, took a full year to complete!\n\nRemember, the Men of Knowledge were profiteers.\n\nSelling magic in any form they could.\n\nBakers of magical themed cookies,  mask makers of the spirits associated with sorcery, dancers summoning magic for crowds, and at the top of the pecking order was likely medicine men.\n\nOf the medicine men still living in Mexico there are currently 3 or 4 \"types\".\n\nWith one who handles a specific power plant being a speciality healer variety.\n\nThere's also a cigar handling type.  For spirit rituals I presume.\n\nBack then who knows what all they had, but they were motivated to be able to sell magic to people.\n\nWith the ones doing REAL magic, like talking lizards, being the most advanced.\n\nAnd their magic had to repeat. And had to be reliable.\n\nUsing the ritual, possibly passed down from teacher to student, and maybe even hundreds of years old, they could reproduce something such as \"talking lizards\".\n\nBut you needed ALL THREE elements to make that work.\n\nThe ritual, the Ally who knows the ritual, and the drugs.\n\nWe've gotten rid of the need for drugs.\n\nAnd for the best red zone magic, you likely still do NEED that Ally.\n\nThe problem then is, how to design a ritual.\n\nIt's not an easy thing, but it can be done.\n\nI learned to repeat a few things, several times.\n\nAnd when I wanted to.\n\nBut it took all of my focus.\n\nSimilarly you can do that, but it'll be a combination of superstitious behavior, carefully controlling your daily routine, and not getting distracted by any new \"intent gifts\".\n\nI can't imagine someone doing that.\n\nIt would be like shunning your wealthy uncle when he visits with toys for the whole family, because you're still playing with the Lego block set he brought you last time.\n\nYou turn him down on giving you a new toy that visit.\n\nHighly unlikely...", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kc003jv", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You really get drawn into a very wrong view of what magic is!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if it exists in our normal reality like an advanced computer you could locate, which no one else has.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or a ray gun you bought at the military surplus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like that!

Ideally 10-20 seconds later.\n\nRule #2: They get stronger if you have strong feelings about them.  But you can't experiment with that, because of rule #1.\n\nAnd over time you'll get used to them, so there will be very little energy available to interact with them.\n\nBest thing you can do, if you want them to interact with you, is lure your double to be around.\n\nWith Tensegrity.\n\nThey can freely interact with your double.  And you can merge with your double in percentages that still leave you rational enough to perceive the interaction.\n\n\\&gt;And I am getting a little scared when I see it, to be honest.\n\nThat's ideal.

Sometimes they last longer. After the small light points (I don&amp;#39;t know how to call them) I see some purple luminous masses that move but I cannot control them. Sometimes they get bigger and engulf me, other times they move in front of my eyes, disappear and reappear. Are those the purple puffs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another observation is that in DR if I close eyes I see the exact same thing that I see when I keep them open. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something that I am confused on is that outside of DR, in a normal lighted room i see something that resembles the moving dots on a TV screen when there is no cable plugged in it. I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain it better. Is like a fog that is not actually a fog, sometimes it has general movements for short periods of time like they are flowing in some direction. As soon as I focus my attention on the movement I cannot perceive the general &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot; of these dots anymore. Usually I don&amp;#39;t see them coloured.

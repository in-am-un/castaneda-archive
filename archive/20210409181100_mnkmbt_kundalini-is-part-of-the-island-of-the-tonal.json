We're connected like beads on a string.  \n\nFelix claims he's cyclic with Reni, which makes a good promotional message for Felix, but might actually have been seen by the witches.  They were interested in identifying such connections.\n\nBut Felix is not a past life for Reni.\n\nYou can skip to any bead on your cyclic being chain.   When you arrive, you instantly have all of their knowledge of the place.\n\nYou guys can do that!!!  Don't \"believe\" things.  DO THEM!\n\nBut you can't skip to a bead on another person's chain.\n\nSo I assume some yogis did that, Switched beads and got confused about it.  You could probably trace that belief back to Ishtar, and find the dubious source. I never did it, but that's where it original comes from.\n\nThe God that was dropped to earth as an egg, landed in a lake, and the local bunny rabbits hauled her onto dry land.\n\nThus \"Easter\" (Ishtar).\n\nThat's the source of this belief.  It didn't become more verified over time, it just got used to make money.\n\nAlso, and this is the part impossible to explain.\n\nYou can be a log floating on a river of blue light, in a universe where ripples of energy bring things to the beings. \n\nIt's how they exist.\n\nYou can have 4 arms.\n\nYou can have no body at all, and live off vibrations.\n\nAll of those alternate beings are available to us.\n\nWe're supposed to roam freely though awareness, not getting trapped as we have.\n\nWhere would re-incarnation come into play there?\n\nYou can see those other beings! I've done it many times.  You can BE those, for hours.\n\nOr even 2 weeks if you like.\n\nSometimes it's even hard to return here.\n\nSo,  did you evolved from a guy with 4 arms on the other end of the galaxy too?\n\nOr just from the mud of planet earth?\n\nThe whole idea of re-incarnation makes no sense at all, to sorcerers who can actually go out and see what's happening.\n\nThey only make sense if you're stuck meditating under a \"master\", and have to take his word for things, because his instructions for your meditation prevent you from exploring on your own. If you catch a glimpse of a cyclic being life, he'll tell you to ignore it.\n\nCarlos used to battle that idea of re-incarnation in private classes.  Quite a few times too!\n\nHe seemed to have the most problem with visiting europeans.  \n\nHe'd try to appeal to their sense of logic by asking them, if you keep getting reborn until you reach perfection, what exactly are you \"perfect\" for?\n\nThere's 2 levels to that question.\n\nThe obvious level is to appeal to your sense of modesty, pointing out that you're assuming you are so important there's some higher force that actually cares what happens to you, and has some plan to make you great in the long run.\n\nBut the hidden meaning is, which world, which being, which reality will you be perfect for, and are all of the others discarded because they don't match the description of this one you're trapped in?\n\nRe-incarnation and the belief that enlightenment is permanent,  have destroyed the chances of most Buddhists to ever explore beyond their limited view of reality.\n\nThey create a sort of \"anger\", which holds participants back.\n\nWe've seen it in the other subreddits, trying to find skilled meditators who might be interested in going further.\n\nTheir heads explode very quickly, partly due to false beliefs.", "edited": 1618848536.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gv35zq5", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My seeing is better than that of any Yogi or Buddhist master I know of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I also get to assemble other worlds, and enter them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m friends with demons and spirits, while they&amp;#39;re quite afraid of them for no real reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ve seen, there&amp;#39;s no past lives out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could say I just didn&amp;#39;t see them yet, even though I can see everything else Yogis and Buddhist masters talk about.

We&amp;#39;re connected like beads on a string.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Felix claims he&amp;#39;s cyclic with Reni, which makes a good promotional message for Felix, but might actually have been seen by the witches.  They were interested in identifying such connections.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Felix is not a past life for Reni.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can skip to any bead on your cyclic being chain.   When you arrive, you instantly have all of their knowledge of the place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You guys can do that!!!  Don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;believe&amp;quot; things.  DO THEM!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t skip to a bead on another person&amp;#39;s chain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I assume some yogis did that, Switched beads and got confused about it.  You could probably trace that belief back to Ishtar, and find the dubious source. I never did it, but that&amp;#39;s where it original comes from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The God that was dropped to earth as an egg, landed in a lake, and the local bunny rabbits hauled her onto dry land.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus &amp;quot;Easter&amp;quot; (Ishtar).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the source of this belief.  It didn&amp;#39;t become more verified over time, it just got used to make money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, and this is the part impossible to explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can be a log floating on a river of blue light, in a universe where ripples of energy bring things to the beings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s how they exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can have 4 arms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can have no body at all, and live off vibrations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of those alternate beings are available to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re supposed to roam freely though awareness, not getting trapped as we have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where would re-incarnation come into play there?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see those other beings! I&amp;#39;ve done it many times.  You can BE those, for hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or even 2 weeks if you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;#39;s even hard to return here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So,  did you evolved from a guy with 4 arms on the other end of the galaxy too?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or just from the mud of planet earth?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole idea of re-incarnation makes no sense at all, to sorcerers who can actually go out and see what&amp;#39;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They only make sense if you&amp;#39;re stuck meditating under a &amp;quot;master&amp;quot;, and have to take his word for things, because his instructions for your meditation prevent you from exploring on your own. If you catch a glimpse of a cyclic being life, he&amp;#39;ll tell you to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos used to battle that idea of re-incarnation in private classes.  Quite a few times too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He seemed to have the most problem with visiting europeans.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d try to appeal to their sense of logic by asking them, if you keep getting reborn until you reach perfection, what exactly are you &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; for?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s 2 levels to that question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The obvious level is to appeal to your sense of modesty, pointing out that you&amp;#39;re assuming you are so important there&amp;#39;s some higher force that actually cares what happens to you, and has some plan to make you great in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the hidden meaning is, which world, which being, which reality will you be perfect for, and are all of the others discarded because they don&amp;#39;t match the description of this one you&amp;#39;re trapped in?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Re-incarnation and the belief that enlightenment is permanent,  have destroyed the chances of most Buddhists to ever explore beyond their limited view of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They create a sort of &amp;quot;anger&amp;quot;, which holds participants back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve seen it in the other subreddits, trying to find skilled meditators who might be interested in going further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their heads explode very quickly, partly due to false beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_mnkmbt", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mnkmbt/kundalini_is_part_of_the_island_of_the_tonal/gv35zq5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1618844129.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1618844129.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gv47ufx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gv3y49p", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It's a con game for sure.

It's already bad enough here, and the only thing that seems to make it tolerable, is real magic right in your face.\n\nBut if you must know, we just posted something on this topic just today.\n\nSome of which, darkroom gazers get to see themselves, so they're slightly better off than  a Jehovah's witness, or a Buddhist.  Who have to believe what someone else told them, and never get to actually see if it's true before they die.\n\nHere's our story:\n\nThe universe is trying to become aware of itself.\n\nSo it \"encapsulates\" awareness.\n\nPuts a container around some awareness, and lets it sit there.\n\nThe awareness is free to explore all of reality at first, but then it runs into a problem.\n\nWhen others agree on a particular piece of reality, it becomes \"real\".\n\nSo we got stuck here by  the billions of people who like this reality.\n\nAnd we can't escape.\n\nI'd rather you asked how to get a look outside this reality, because any number of people in here can already do that, and could give you excellent answers.\n\nBut as for why all this happens, the theory of the old sorcerers we copy (from around 10K  years ago), is that the universe just wants to be aware of what it contains.\n\nWe're probes.\n\nWe accumulate memories, and then when we die, it wants the memories.\n\nI doesn't care about our awareness (for now).  It would tend to let us keep that (live past death).

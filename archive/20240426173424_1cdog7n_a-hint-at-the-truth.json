Not a tame Ally like those of Carlos.

And certainly won't let you look into the depths of how reality itself is constructed.\n\nDown there you get to \"see\" all aspects of our perceptions while dong the magical passes.

At least in there, it's warm and you have lots of company.\n\nBut why do that???\n\nJust take what you learned, and go \"fix\" something else you find more cozy!\n\nMake Yoga less imponent for example.\n\nCarol Tiggs seems to be involved in that.\n\nAnd while I'm at it, Soledad implanted INCREDIBLE knowledge in Star Wars.\n\nOr at least, something did.\n\nWhen you have continuous seeing available to you, what Yoda said about the dark side of the force clouding your vision becomes obvious in the attacks we constantly get from bad players in this subreddit.\n\nThey can literally prevent seeing with their awful behavior.\n\nThe same as the Sith do to the Jedi.

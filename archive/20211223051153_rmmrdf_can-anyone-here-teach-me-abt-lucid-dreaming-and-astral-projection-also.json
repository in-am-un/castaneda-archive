What Carlos taught, and what is written in his books, is the holy grail of what you are calling \"Astral Projection\" and \"Lucid Dreaming\".  The teachings are mind-bogglingly on point and comprehensive, but remember, they are just rivers that lead to a much bigger world of sorcery, and those terms are never used by CC, nor anyone who practices what he taught. I'll use them here to help clarify a few things.\n\n2)  I found Castaneda  in the midst of an onslaught of Lucid Dreams and astral Projections that I wasn't willing to happen, they were just happening to me, and someone pointed out that the street I was living on was in Carlos Castaneda's books.  I said, \"Who's that?\"  They told me.  I went and bought Art of Dreaming, what I read there changed my life.  I put the rules he laid out into practice and did a shit ton of what you're calling Lucid Dreams Astral Projection and Shape shifting.  Here's the thing:  So fucking what?  As you'll learn if you come to this sub, in means nothing if you can't consciously control it. Worse, you become an insufferable prick, as people all over this sub will either tell you, or you'll even see it in their posts.  I can't even imagine what my wife thought of me in that era, or my friends.  Pure mental masturbation.   Just a 20 something shit head who though a few magical experiences made me a sorcerer. lol don't let that be you.   \n\n3) If you want the real holy grail, you go in the front door consciously, you move your assemblage point at will - along the J curve if you read around this sub, you'll understand - but you wanna WILLFULLY do that.\n\nSOME TIPS:\n\n1)  Inner silence.  This is, obviously, #1.  I say obviously because I think nearly every tradition recognizes this as a sort of key.  Same here.  You have to have silence to move the AP, and was you are calling Lucid Dreaming and Astral Projection is essentially just moving the assemblage point or reaching the energy body  So just by having inner silence, practicing it, ideally in the dark room, you'll start to progress, and a byproduct is, yes, you'll \"Luck\" into some very amazing experiences, the ones you call Lucid dreaming and Astral Projection.  You'll have no real control, however, and they won't last long, because you won't have enough energy to sustain them for very long, nor the tools and practice to do anything of substance in them. \n\n2)  Dropping your inventory.  Don Juan said he scrapes for energy, like scraping peanut butter from the bottom of the jar.  You have to free it up in your waking world.  So when you say you want to learn everything about astral projection and lucid dreaming, and then you say, \"And entering other people's dreams\",  it's like, \"Gee, what's her name?\"  Whatever reasons or motives you have, lose them. They will weigh you down, quite literally, and you won't be able to move the assemblage point.   This process, call it recapitulation, stalking the self, is very important to dreaming. Making yourself lighter by dropping your baggage and bullshit.  In this way, stalking and dreaming support each other. So you wanna work on all this concurrently:  practicing inner silence in the darkroom, while working on dropping your ego and inventory and bullshit and energy tied up out there.  You try to make yourself light as a feather.  These are the ideal conditions for dreaming, in my experience (and by dreaming I simply mean moving the AP)\n\nJust remember, there is way more to the picture than 'lucid dreaming'.  Remember: the inorganic beings are real.  So that's a game changer.  If you're not ready for that, take your lucky experiences and walk away.  If you want to go past that, gain allies, and continue into this world, then practice going in the front door through conscious gazing and willful movement of the assemblage point, and understand that dreaming is just a river into a much, much bigger ocean.

No way was I walking into a place which had a differential in how time passes.  \n\n\nIn fact, Cholita had warned me not to do it, earlier in the evening.  \n\n\nWithout actually specifying what danger she was referring to.  \n\n\nCould just be, she thought I was spending too much time alone in my locked room, in darkness.

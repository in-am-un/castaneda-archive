She'd even chastise me if I used too much in \"one serving\".\n\nThe rest was all rotten bread.

If you made a mistake, the dog would reject it.\n\nEventually the dog becomes \"snobby\", and will \"send it back\" for more mashing.\n\nI had to learn the physical movements to mash it right,  from the master herself!\n\nAunt Ida.\n\nSo my cerebellum memorized the mashing movements, as it does for all movements we learn.\n\nWe don't control our body directly.\n\nIt does.\n\nWe can call up \"subroutines\".  Even very simple ones, like \"open your hand\".\n\nBut they are still subroutines.\n\nAnd the \"dog food cost reduction\" movements, are subroutines still in my cerebellum.  Subroutines controlled by \"the mood of stinginess\".\n\nYou feel like like Ebenezer Scrooge, when you start mashing moldy bread into perfectly good dog food.\n\nKeep in mind, the cerebellum is sentient.\n\nIf it were not, you couldn't catch a glass that is falling off the table, before your conscious mind realizes it.\n\nYour cerebellum notices the situation by hacking into your visual feed, and before you are even conscious there's a problem your hand reaches out at incredible speed, and catches the glass.\n\nBy the way, with an internal dialogue you get 1 chance to catch it.\n\nIf you get rid of that, you get 3.\n\nYou'll see!  It's amazing enough that if you do it in front of someone else, they'll gasp like you were Zatoichi or something. In my case, my hand will try twice, and if it's still falling, my foot comes up and catches it.\n\nI'm even amazed!\n\nNow when that cerebellum runs a subroutine, it calls up the \"mood\".\n\nMood, is a key part of movement it seems.\n\nAnd so walking around during the day, we are literally submerged in a \"swamp of grief\".\n\nJust by moving around.\n\nTensegrity retrains that, over the  years.\n\nYou'll see it!  You'll be doing the tensegrity form, and suddenly you realize the movements are entirely different now. \n\nThey're \"joyful\", instead of \"choreful\". And you'll get to switch back and forth, and understand the truth of it all.\n\nWe're DROWNING in grief!\n\nBut there's even more that Tensetrity does!\n\nIt affects \"the abstract\" also. The \"glue\" between rational things.\n\nSo it works on many levels.\n\nProbably because the old seers invented the movements.\n\nCarlos just hid them in martial arts like forms, to preserve them.", "edited": 1677023542.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j9hbpu7", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s more like gas that evaporates too fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe we&amp;#39;re running on Butane?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can fill a little ceramic bowl with Butane!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll sit right there like it wasn&amp;#39;t colder than ice, and totally gaseous at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it won&amp;#39;t be there the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s important to practice daily if at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be devastated if I had to skip a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just don&amp;#39;t want to lose the stored intent!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, the &amp;quot;more and more results&amp;quot; happen on multiple levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish to God I knew how Carlos did that...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you may believe you are doing one thing, but then over time you realize it&amp;#39;s doing something else also.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the something else is vastly better!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It retrains you how to move, &amp;quot;grief free&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t explain that to someone who hasn&amp;#39;t seen it with their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could try to use a metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you had a nasty old &amp;quot;Aunt Ida&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t even use that name anymore, in &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aunt Ida was a bit schizophrenic, but way back when she was alive &amp;quot;no one&amp;quot; had mental illness.

If you made a mistake, the dog would reject it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually the dog becomes &amp;quot;snobby&amp;quot;, and will &amp;quot;send it back&amp;quot; for more mashing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to learn the physical movements to mash it right,  from the master herself!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aunt Ida.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my cerebellum memorized the mashing movements, as it does for all movements we learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t control our body directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can call up &amp;quot;subroutines&amp;quot;.  Even very simple ones, like &amp;quot;open your hand&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they are still subroutines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;quot;dog food cost reduction&amp;quot; movements, are subroutines still in my cerebellum.  Subroutines controlled by &amp;quot;the mood of stinginess&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You feel like like Ebenezer Scrooge, when you start mashing moldy bread into perfectly good dog food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, the cerebellum is sentient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it were not, you couldn&amp;#39;t catch a glass that is falling off the table, before your conscious mind realizes it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your cerebellum notices the situation by hacking into your visual feed, and before you are even conscious there&amp;#39;s a problem your hand reaches out at incredible speed, and catches the glass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, with an internal dialogue you get 1 chance to catch it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get rid of that, you get 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll see!  It&amp;#39;s amazing enough that if you do it in front of someone else, they&amp;#39;ll gasp like you were Zatoichi or something. In my case, my hand will try twice, and if it&amp;#39;s still falling, my foot comes up and catches it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m even amazed!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now when that cerebellum runs a subroutine, it calls up the &amp;quot;mood&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mood, is a key part of movement it seems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so walking around during the day, we are literally submerged in a &amp;quot;swamp of grief&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just by moving around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tensegrity retrains that, over the  years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll see it!  You&amp;#39;ll be doing the tensegrity form, and suddenly you realize the movements are entirely different now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;joyful&amp;quot;, instead of &amp;quot;choreful&amp;quot;. And you&amp;#39;ll get to switch back and forth, and understand the truth of it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re DROWNING in grief!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s even more that Tensetrity does!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It affects &amp;quot;the abstract&amp;quot; also. The &amp;quot;glue&amp;quot; between rational things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it works on many levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably because the old seers invented the movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos just hid them in martial arts like forms, to preserve them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_z0ovdq", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/z0ovdq/question_about_tensegrity_and_disability/j9hbpu7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1677023188.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1677023188.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j9h92h8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Fine_Ad3410", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1677022087.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ix8cxvw", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_eor92y5x", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Huge bump to this answer, I think it's most important part that while it's a container for magic, it needs time to fill up to see more and more results.

So he has to overcome it himself.\n\nIOBs come to wrestle with us, and become our ally.  My guess would be that they aren't nearly as hard on children, as adults.  Just a scary look, and if you can manage to ignore it they're yours.\n\nBut our parents put a stop to it.As they will with any real magic.It's ok to join a pretend magic group, even a big religion like Buddhism.  Or a culty Christian one that believes they speak \"with the holy spirit\".\n\nBut the real thing always brings hatred and delusional attacks.\n\nI suppose that means people actually do know real from pretend. They just don't believe any of the real kind exists.\n\nAnd they get angry because if our type of magic exists, the mainstream religions are obvious frauds.\n\nMany people BADLY need their religion.\n\nWe don't really know what religion the Olmecs practiced.  But it wasn't the same as the \"old seers\".  Just stuff that came up, as a result of them.\n\nIt was probably left over understanding of their sorcery,  and spirits they described, made easier for people who wouldn't do any work to think about and take comfort in.\n\nLike \"Mescalito\" the protector.\n\nYou believe that???  He couldn't protect all the peyote in my county. It's been gone 100 years.\n\nNot much of a protector.\n\nBut he makes an awesome cave painting!\n\nUnfortunately now, with everyone living in rooms and dominated by fake magic systems stealing their money, the real thing is far from comforting.  It goes against the made up stuff they've been taught to believe.\n\nAnd so we banished the monster to the closet forever. Into the \"lost and found\" of Bubble Station.\n\nI was approached by a \"Monster from Under the Bed\" last night.\n\nI wasn't even up.  Just resting before practicing. Mostly asleep.\n\nI opened my eyes,  laying on my side, and there was what I believed to be the \"Woman of the Tunnel\" from my phantom \"Dream Bubble Station\".\n\nWe have yet to figure out what she is.  Doesn't move like an IOB, but doesn't move like Cholita's double either.\n\nIsn't a Golem as far as I know.  It's been too long since I formed one with Pandora's box and sent it down the station's tunnel into south america.\n\nThose are made from puffs of your own energy body.  They don't last more than a day, and  usually just minutes.\n\nThis woman would emerge from the tunnel as smoke, and form into a perfect pink and white woman.   And oddly, it's hard to say if she's transparent. With IOBs, that's usually easy to see.\n\nYou can \"rate\" your horizontal shift, by how solid they look.This woman comes on a \"background\" of some kind. Too blurry to see, but between the two of them, she's not transparent.\n\nOn this night, I could briefly see a little boy clinging to her.   Like he was standing behind her, something the Devil's Weed entity used to do, and just came out for an instant so I knew he was there.\n\nI asked, \"Minx???\"  But there was no response.\n\nThe woman follows the second attention fog disturbances if I walk around the room, but won't respond to me.\n\nBut tonight I barely opened my eyes to reassure myself I'd turned off the lights and  the room was dark, and there she was.  Standing on the left side of the bed like a real person, staring directly at me.\n\nI'm used to sights like that, so instead of running for my life I said \"Hey, you can see me now?  You're always welcome here at Bubble Station!\"\n\nI tried opening and closing my eyes, another way to tell different entities apart.\n\nIf there was  a difference in how she looked, it wasn't significant enough to describe.\n\nI still wasn't sure who she was.  Not even if she were the same women who comes from the tunnel.\n\nAfter opening and closing just a few times, when I closed them I saw an INTENSE patch of red.\n\nOn some kind of shape I sort of recalled from earlier.  A square food item??\n\nThe women said, \"It's the intent you made.\n\n\"She was right, I remembered.  But where?  When?\n\nI opened my eyes to see if that sight had changed her,  but it hadn't.\n\nSo now I knew, this women is there whether you open your eyes or close them, but your closed eye view can be suddenly focused on something else.  As if she had control over that view.\n\nShe said, \"Remember this one?\"\n\nAn intensely green patch materialized, over what I could only describe as a \"carrot\".\n\nDidn't look anything like a carrot.  But that's all I can translate it into.\n\nShe said, \"That didn't start green.  Remember?\"\n\nI did!  As I watched, the green split into a blue patch, and a yellow patch.\n\nBut when had I seen that? I searched my memory for a few seconds, but then fell into dreaming.\n\nIt became obvious.\n\nThe woman was now 100% real because I'd entered her \"dreaming level\".\n\nShe said, \"Good, you came to my copy of the room.  Did you learn how to do that?\"\n\nI asked, \"by finding intent that stretches down into the dream you want?\"\n\nShe said, \"Right!  But did you notice how intermittent intent really is?\"\n\nI was still stuck on the idea that you could use intent to \"enter a dream\" version of where you were located. Or \"align\" yourself to an entity that was mostly in another dream you weren't yourself in.\n\nDoubles can do that.  Be half \"here\", and half \"there\".\n\nI remembered don Juan saying that the truth about how you find your hands in dreaming, is that intent itself helps you do that. It gives you a nudge.\n\nI looked at the dream now in front of me, then \"backed\" off to see the green intent blob, and then backed off to see the red one.  Actually, the movement felt to be \"up\" each transition.\n\nStarting at the red one, I wanted to see if you \"moved\" as a result of traveling all the way down into the dream.\n\nI did!  I slid a few inches in some medium,  \"down\", until I hit the second intent blob.\n\nIt took an instant before I could see  the green color. And to make sure, I slid it apart into blue and yellow, then put it back together.\n\nThe woman said, \"Reality isn't as smooth as you believe!\"\n\nShe suggested I notice that it was \"the abstract\" that could move you from here, to there.\n\nI kept going into the dream, and she was right.  What I sensed \"on the walls\" as I moved in, was too abstract to describe at all.  I believe I managed to find a word at the time, to describe it,  but it's lost now.\n\nA story started to form in my mind.\n\nThe woman said, \"Intent blobs are already stories!\"\n\nShe continued to explain that Silent Knowledge was served in tiny intent blobs.  Micro bundles.\n\nThe entire flow was a series of \"sub bundles\", and couldn't possibly be continuous. The range of those blobs couldn't cover that many emanations, spread so far apart. But you could \"skip to the next one\" almost invisibly.\n\nShe said, \"You won't like this, but dreams are also broken like that.\"\n\nI went back to my memories of the 3rd gate, where I had in fact realized that although at the depth of \"dream inside a dream inside a dream\" I had managed to remain 2 weeks.\n\nBut when I finally woke up it had only been 12 hours.\n\nAnd as I thought about the 2 weeks I realized I had memories of many things, but not of doing them.\n\nFor example, I took out the trash.\n\nBut why can't I remember running into something on the way?  Like the cat who lives next door.\n\nOr even what the other trash out there looked like.  How it smelled.\n\nI returned to 3 level deep dreaming many times after that,  back when Carlos was still around, always a bit paranoid of why I thought dreams were continuous when obviously they were not.\n\nIf something had just happened in a dream I tried hard to remember the details of how that occured.\n\nI finally realized, the dream probably doesn't last 2 weeks.\n\nIt probably only seems that way, because you have the \"key memories\".\n\nBut no details.\n\nAs I lay there trying to view the abstract shapes more,  the red one and the green one, I counted them to keep track.\n\nI had one object, two objects, and the woman's presence.  I lost track of how many times I counted them.\n\nI woke up a while later, groggy and missing 4 hours. I was already 2 hours late to work!\n\nIt was an IOB trap!  She trapped me in abstract dreaming.\n\nI don't know why I didn't notice that.  The brilliant saturated colors, and the obsession with counting were so obvious.\n\nI got up and stretched my arms, realizing I was quite sore from using the weight machines at the gym.  I'd had to give it up during covid.\n\nI suspect that's why this entity was able to trap me like that.  They can \"pull\" on any physical ailment.\n\nCarlos said they tried to unravel him like a sweater because of his cancer, and he found himself hopping from rock to rock, with nothing but water surrounding the stepping stones. \n\nIf he fell into the water, he realized he would be trapped in their world.\n\nAnother description of the IOB world as having places with \"water\".\n\nI later complained to Little Smoke about her and Devil's Weed trying to kidnap Carlos.  A good 15 years later at the least.\n\nShe seemed hurt and said, \"We tried to SAVE him, not kidnap him.\"\n\nThey didn't want him to die.", "edited": 1655223952.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iccehme", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great way to scare the shit out of the kid, but convince him he&amp;#39;s on his own.

A good 15 years later at the least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She seemed hurt and said, &amp;quot;We tried to SAVE him, not kidnap him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t want him to die.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/vc27m0/monster_under_the_bed/iccehme/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1655223214.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_vc27m0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "icbr3tx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "NightComprehensive52", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1655212950.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_vc27m0", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_7zxv6xqs", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Lol", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_icbr3tx", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/vc27m0/monster_under_the_bed/icbr3tx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1655212950.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_vc27m0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}]

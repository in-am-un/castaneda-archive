After reading your comments on here I found we have a lot of similair opinions like how buddhism is tainted by the hierarchic nature of asian society and you giving atleast some props to hinduism and TM.\n\nThe technique isn't really ment to produce magic. It's more supposed to help silencing the inner dialogue, sort of like meditation. \n\nI wasn't even gonna bring it up, because I thougt it didn't align with your guys' goals, but then I saw TRE mentioned in your wiki and I've had immense results with that technique.\n\nAlso what I really like about you guys that you don't have any dogmatic adherance to any school or system you guys just try stuff and see If it works and then if it works you do it.\n\nThe reason I wanted to ask people here is cause you guys seem to be very versed in different techniques and your opinions align with lots of my own.\n\nIf I asked in another subreddit I would just get guys shilling their school to me and unlikely to find anyone familiar with this technique or even willing top try it. I'd Just get some guy telling me do zen meditation.\n\nI'm not trying to sell you guys this technique just trying to see If anyone has experience with it since you guys seem to be very practical about evaluating techniques and you saw some value in TRE which also St\u00fcck Out to me as effective.\n\nSo maybe I should create a post after all, I just didn't want to polute the subreddit with stuff that doesn't totally align with your goals since this is more general discussion of a technique.

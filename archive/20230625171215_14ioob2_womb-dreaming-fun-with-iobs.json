People like to see stuff from someone other than me.\n\nAnd the famous Joanne who has her own tensegrity video channel on YouTube (her brother too?), is looking at that feed lately.\n\nIt's good for her to see women playing with real magic.\n\nI hope this doesn't mean my Ally \"Fancy\" decided to ditch me, and go live with someone else!  \n\nShe's done that red riding hood look for me a bunch of times.\n\nThe Allies have been trying to \"come back\" to my darkroom, after being kicked out by Cholita's old witch friend.\n\nAnd I can again see the start of their formation.\n\nBut without them around a whole week, I learned to \"look past them\".  \n\nSo I ignore it in favor of using them only as a \"gauge\" of something I ought to be looking for, behind them.\n\nIt's hard to explain, but there's ultimately a lot more to see without the Allies.\n\nWe need their dark energy to move the assemblage point.\n\nBut we don't have to be enslaved to them.\n\nThat wouldn't bother me. The enslaved part. Except that I was \"busted\".\n\nSo I suppose mine are homeless now.\n\nAnd without them dominating things, you notice more.\n\nFor example, the \"breath change\" turns out to be what don Juan was referring to, when he advised Carlos he could switch to his double by focusing on his breathing.\n\nHe didn't mean, \"Do 10,000 Wim Hof Breaths, and the double will return to you from the high mountains of Tibet.\"\n\nSounds ludicrous?\n\nThat was pretty much Wim's \"story\", to justify those lame breathing exercises.\n\nNow perpetuated by his greedy son I'm told.  Wim is probably embarrassed by it these days. \n\nPeople grow up.\n\nSo you \"breath work\" people forget it.\n\nIt won't lead you to anything useful that I'm aware of.\n\nIt can help you get back to something you discovered by another method.\n\nJust not lead you to it in the first place.\n\nThus you can focus on a familiar type of breathing you noticed in darkroom, which is associated with magic. \n\nAnd that's a direct link to that assemblage point position!\n\nAnything would be.  \n\nIf you heard cheesy mariachi music in silent knowledge, you could listen for that.\n\nI'd have to jump off a cliff, but it's still a valid way to find your path in the emanations.\n\nOr if you smelled bread baking at Jadey's house 6000 miles away, you could get to the orange zone by looking for that smell.\n\nNot easily, so don't anyone misunderstand.\n\nAnd the \"breath change\" of Silent Knowledge, is also when the double is near.  \n\nSo don Juan suggested you could look for that breath \"feeling\", and move your assemblage point.\n\nHe was right!\n\nBut only if you saw that type of breathing and the magical results, over and over again.\n\nI believe the Allies tend to manifest where you could be seeing something else, if they hadn't blocked your view.\n\nLike your cat walking across your keyboard and sitting down to block your view of the monitor on your computer.\n\nUsually when there was something you REALLY ought to have seen.\n\nI suppose just like cats, the Allies can see when something is going to generate emotions. \n\nOf any kind. Even enthusiasm is good to the IOBs.\n\nAnd cats too.\n\nI'm still trying to track down Cholita's \"Phantom cat\".\n\nWhen I went to work 2 days ago, very early in the morning, it ran out from under my car as if it had been there all night.\n\nIt's still obsessed with the smell in the driveway?\n\nOr the possible blue jay bird graves in the backyard.  Maybe it likes to be near its trophies?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jphpi9k", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stole it for Facebook.

Wim is probably embarrassed by it these days. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People grow up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you &amp;quot;breath work&amp;quot; people forget it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t lead you to anything useful that I&amp;#39;m aware of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can help you get back to something you discovered by another method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just not lead you to it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus you can focus on a familiar type of breathing you noticed in darkroom, which is associated with magic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s a direct link to that assemblage point position!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything would be.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you heard cheesy mariachi music in silent knowledge, you could listen for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d have to jump off a cliff, but it&amp;#39;s still a valid way to find your path in the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if you smelled bread baking at Jadey&amp;#39;s house 6000 miles away, you could get to the orange zone by looking for that smell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not easily, so don&amp;#39;t anyone misunderstand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;quot;breath change&amp;quot; of Silent Knowledge, is also when the double is near.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don Juan suggested you could look for that breath &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot;, and move your assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was right!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But only if you saw that type of breathing and the magical results, over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe the Allies tend to manifest where you could be seeing something else, if they hadn&amp;#39;t blocked your view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like your cat walking across your keyboard and sitting down to block your view of the monitor on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Usually when there was something you REALLY ought to have seen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose just like cats, the Allies can see when something is going to generate emotions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of any kind.

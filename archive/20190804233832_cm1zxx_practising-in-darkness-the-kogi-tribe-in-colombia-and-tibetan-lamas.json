It could come in handy for those of you visiting a foreign country. I wish I knew about it the last time I was at the forbidden city.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s no where near an ordinary dream, but you\u2019ll have to find that out for  yourself.\n\nI believe what happened was, I spent a good 12 hours forcing silence at home on the weekend, then went to work to feed the tropical fish.   The building was empty, so it was very dark.  I noticed the big warehouse had been cleaned out, leaving a nice big space. I went in to see if I could summon blobs of color, and maybe even hypnogogic images.  It\u2019s hard to resist dark spaces once you learn waking dreaming.\n\nI did get some colors to form, and a vague hypnogogic head.\n\nThen I went home, and later that evening resumed silence in darkness.\n\nI suspect that by copying that technique a little bit at work, I focused my second attention.  And then later, when I was forcing out the last bits of internal dialogue and fantasy images, I went blank.  But instead of ending up assembling another world, I ended up at work.  At precisely the same spot I was when I decided to check out the dark back storeroom.\n\nI was a little confused, but figured I had fallen asleep at work.  Then I started to feel a super creepy feeling, the one absolutely associated with Carlos\u2019 allies hanging out in the area.\n\nThat should have made me realize what was going on, but it didn\u2019t.  In such a state you have most of your reason, but not all of it.  In particular, silence causes you to give up the concerns that can\u2019t be resolved, and also you stop questioning \u201cwhere you are\u201d.  Meaning, you are where you are, instead of constantly keeping track.\n\nSo the technique is this:  Learn to get silent in darkness, stare at colors, scoop them in closer, form the second attention\u2019s energy body, and then you can focus your second attention elsewhere, and return there in your energy body.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you could learn to do this on demand. I suspect that\u2019s our obstacle.  Thinking you can learn to do something on demand, easily.\n\nYou probably can\u2019t.  But in the course of the frustration of not being able to duplicate what you believe is important to duplicate, you discover all the fine details which turn out to be more useful in the long run.  You will learn to do things on demand, just not the ones you thought were important.\n\nCan you do it too?  You can if you actually work at it.  That\u2019s all that stops people.  Not working on it.\n\nIn Carlos\u2019 case, he was with Zuleica all night long.  It wasn\u2019t an hour here or there. Don Juan dropped him off in heightened awareness, and he practiced all night.  Carlos cleverly hinted at this when he wrote that one of the people in don  Juan's party had said that dreamers never lack for sleep, even though they practice all night.\n\nDid you miss the hint?  You have all the time you need; give up half your sleep time for a while and see how you feel.\n\nSometimes, Carlos just went into a pleasant state and remained there, to learn that it wasn\u2019t all that useful, wallowing in bliss.  Naturally that would count as sleep, even though he was aware of it.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long it took Carlos to form his second attention energy body, but I suspect he returned to Zuleica for weeks, not days.  But I\u2019ve \u201chalf\u201d formed it, if that\u2019s possible.

I wish I knew about it the last time I was at the forbidden city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, it\u2019s no where near an ordinary dream, but you\u2019ll have to find that out for  yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe what happened was, I spent a good 12 hours forcing silence at home on the weekend, then went to work to feed the tropical fish.   The building was empty, so it was very dark.  I noticed the big warehouse had been cleaned out, leaving a nice big space. I went in to see if I could summon blobs of color, and maybe even hypnogogic images.  It\u2019s hard to resist dark spaces once you learn waking dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did get some colors to form, and a vague hypnogogic head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I went home, and later that evening resumed silence in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect that by copying that technique a little bit at work, I focused my second attention.  And then later, when I was forcing out the last bits of internal dialogue and fantasy images, I went blank.  But instead of ending up assembling another world, I ended up at work.  At precisely the same spot I was when I decided to check out the dark back storeroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a little confused, but figured I had fallen asleep at work.  Then I started to feel a super creepy feeling, the one absolutely associated with Carlos\u2019 allies hanging out in the area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That should have made me realize what was going on, but it didn\u2019t.  In such a state you have most of your reason, but not all of it.  In particular, silence causes you to give up the concerns that can\u2019t be resolved, and also you stop questioning \u201cwhere you are\u201d.  Meaning, you are where you are, instead of constantly keeping track.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the technique is this:  Learn to get silent in darkness, stare at colors, scoop them in closer, form the second attention\u2019s energy body, and then you can focus your second attention elsewhere, and return there in your energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not saying you could learn to do this on demand. I suspect that\u2019s our obstacle.  Thinking you can learn to do something on demand, easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You probably can\u2019t.  But in the course of the frustration of not being able to duplicate what you believe is important to duplicate, you discover all the fine details which turn out to be more useful in the long run.  You will learn to do things on demand, just not the ones you thought were important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you do it too?  You can if you actually work at it.  That\u2019s all that stops people.  Not working on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Carlos\u2019 case, he was with Zuleica all night long.  It wasn\u2019t an hour here or there. Don Juan dropped him off in heightened awareness, and he practiced all night.  Carlos cleverly hinted at this when he wrote that one of the people in don  Juan&amp;#39;s party had said that dreamers never lack for sleep, even though they practice all night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you miss the hint?  You have all the time you need; give up half your sleep time for a while and see how you feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, Carlos just went into a pleasant state and remained there, to learn that it wasn\u2019t all that useful, wallowing in bliss.  Naturally that would count as sleep, even though he was aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know how long it took Carlos to form his second attention energy body, but I suspect he returned to Zuleica for weeks, not days.  But I\u2019ve \u201chalf\u201d formed it, if that\u2019s possible.  And I\u2019ve only been trying out Zuleica\u2019s technique for a couple of months at the most.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos probably didn\u2019t make it clear how much work was needed because he knew there would be rewards along the way if any effort at all was made, and he didn\u2019t want to discourage people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_cm1zxx", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/cm1zxx/practising_in_darkness_the_kogi_tribe_in_colombia/ew4ia56/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1565111212.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1565111212.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ew1qm7i", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ew1pnum", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "It's pretty high up!

Like visiting a foreign country.\n\nAnd seeing a single dot in the middle?  I don't believe that at all. That's something for them to concentrate on producing, to help remove the last traces of the internal dialogue.  It's not a universal truth leading to something.\n\nSomeone made it up or misunderstood something else (maybe the author), and it got passed down the same way book deals go.  One person exagerates the previous.\n\nI'm not putting that down, that's a wonderful practice.  But don't take it as a roadmap; it's lacking at several levels.\n\nAs for the single object, I was shocked to see a big eye in front of me in the darkness last night. I'd read about it while trying to figure out how to do La Gorda's flying technique (which I got to work, sort of).\n\nBut seeing that eye, especially after having posted here that it's silly to think that's universal,   I couldn't help but speak out loud.\n\nI said, \"Come on La Gorda, you expect me to believe everyone sees this lame eye thing?\"\n\nIt went away.\n\nNewbies: All this was after 12 hours of gazing at darkness in silence, so it's not like this sort of thing happens easily or frequently.  If you know someone running around with constant tales of power like this, he's likely making it up.\n\nBut if you  hear about having to sweat blood to get small things to happen, that's more truthful about how this path goes.

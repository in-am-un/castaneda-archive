This could be a partial answer to this very important question.\n\nThe book is not adventure or novel to read, but it has some clues which could tell us \"yes, it IS coming from there\"! And this is precious, I would say.\n\n&gt;Some quotes:\n\n\"The root\u00a0na, to know, is the primitive monosyllabic stem to which we trace all of them.\u00a0Nahual\u00a0means knowledge, especially mystic knowledge, the Gnosis, the knowledge of the hidden and secret things of nature; easily enough confounded in uncultivated minds with sorcery and magic.\n\nIt is true that de la Serna derives the Mexican\u00a0naualli, a sorcerer, from the verb\u00a0nahualtia, to mask or disguise oneself, \u201cbecause a\u00a0naualli\u00a0is one who masks or disguises himself under the form of some lower animal, which is his\u00a0nagual;\u201d58-\u2020\u00a0but it is altogether likely that\u00a0nahualtia\u00a0derived its meaning from the custom of the medicine men to wear masks during their ceremonies.\n\nTherefore, if the term\u00a0nagual, and many of its associates and derivatives, were at first borrowed from the Zapotec language, a necessary\u00a0corrollary\u00a0of this conclusion is, that along with these terms came most of the superstitions, rites and beliefs to which they allude; which thus became grafted on the general tendency to such superstitions existing everywhere and at all times in the human mind.\n\nAs I have said, nowhere in the records of purely Mexican, that is, Aztecan, Nagualism do we find the word\u00a0nagual\u00a0employed in the sense given in the passage quoted from Herrera, that is as a personal guardian spirit or tutelary genius. These tribes had, indeed, a belief in some such protecting power, and held that it was connected with the day on which each person is born. They called it the\u00a0tonalli\u00a0of a person, a word translated to mean that which is peculiar to him, which makes his individuality, his self. The radical from which it is derived is\u00a0tona, to warm, or to be warm, from which are also derived\u00a0tonatiuh, the sun.Tonalli, which in composition loses its last syllable, is likewise the word for heat, summer, soul, spirit and day, and also for the share or portion which belongs to one. Thus,\u00a0to-tonal\u00a0is spirit or soul in general;\u00a0no-tonal, my spirit;\u00a0no-tonal in ipan no-tlacat, \u201cthe sign under which I was born,\u201d\u00a0i. e., the astrological day-sign. From this came the verb\u00a0tonalpoa, to count or estimate the signs, that is, to cast the horoscope of a person; and\u00a0tonalpouhque, the diviners whose business it was to practice this art.\n\nThe\u00a0nahual\u00a0is generally an old Indian with red eyes, who knows how to turn himself into a dog, woolly, black and ugly. The female witch can convert herself into a ball of fire; she has the power of flight, and at night will enter the windows and suck the blood of little children. These sorcerers will make little images of rags or of clay, then stick into them the thorn of the maguey and place them in some secret place; you can[11]\u00a0be sure that the person against whom the conjuration is practiced will feel pain in the part where the thorn is inserted. There still exist among them the medicine-men, who treat the sick by means of strange contortions, call upon the spirits, pronounce magical incantations, blow upon the part where the pain is, and draw forth from the patient thorns, worms, or pieces of stone. They know how to prepare drinks which will bring on sickness, and if the patients are cured by others the convalescents are particular to throw something of their own away, as a lock of hair, or a part of their clothing. Those who possess the evil eye can, by merely looking at children, deprive them of beauty and health, and even cause their death.\n\nTo transform themselves into a globe or ball of fire was, as we have seen (ant\u00e8, p. 21), a power claimed by expert nagualists, and to handle it with impunity, or to blow it from the mouth, was one of their commonest exhibitions.

This one we normally live in only seems real because there's billions of people's *intent* behind it.\n\nCarlos made many efforts to tie the members of his group into the sorcerer's myth, with name changes and back stories.\n\nAt the time, I thought it was rather stupid to take on a new name, and the whole Chacmool thing seemed like high school theater class antics.\n\nBut once you can get silent, you can follow stray *intent* picked up right from the air. It hangs out there, like thousands of local but faint radio stations.\n\nAnd you can even *intend* new things, and have them come back many times. Those have only your own *intent* behind them, and still they can persist.\n\nCholita's witchcraft is also all about *intent*. She uses spells most of the time, which I suppose hook you to the *intent* of the spell designer. But they also are connected to the normal world, the same way Carlos connected the people in his group to the old sorcerers.\n\nLately Cholita\u2019s been searching Carlos\u2019 books for a cure for herself. She keeps one in the bathroom, open with spine up. She protects it with a red mirror she's used several times in spells. The last time I saw it, the glass was cracked in half.\n\nOddly, it was no longer cracked. She must have had more than one.\n\nSeeing that book there each day is too tempting, so I carefully disturb her arrangement each morning, to see if she\u2019s read more pages.\n\nAs it turns out, she reads it everyday. And she underlines and highlights key points.\n\nToday it was a passage about the Nagual coming out, and how impossible it was to describe it.\n\nBut she\u2019d also underlined passages about how the Nagual can be deadly. An encounter can result in your death. She underlined that particularly hard.  She must have been reading that the day before.\n\nAnd last night, as part of a continuing spell, Cholita staged herself to be innocently sitting around in the living room, in very expensive clothes. Her hair was all puffed up.\n\nShe caused a fuse to blow, so I\u2019d have to come out and see her.\n\nUsually I hide, since she tried to murder me a week or two ago.\n\nI'd already explained to her that we needed to move her powerful electric heater to the same outlet as the air conditioner, because none of the other outlets have enough amps.  The fuse blows as it gets colder outside, and more heat is needed.\n\nThat outlet was in fact closer to where she liked to sit, so it all made sense.\n\nOnce she realized it could blow the fuse if left on the wrong outlet, she started using it to manipulate me.\n\nShe'd cause the fuse to blow, whenever she wanted me to see something she'd staged.\n\nThe first time it blew last night, I bought into the idea that maybe she was just too forgetful. And blowing the fuse was an accident.\n\nShe was sitting at a table playing with a huge jigsaw puzzle. Her fingernails were painted light blue, and she had on pretty black bead and silver bracelets with bare forearms,  a very simple tattoo forming one of the delicate bracelets. She pushed the colored pieces of the puzzle around on the table.  She'd selected the ones with the best match to her dark hands and light fingernails. She had a pile of them on a flat surface, so she could slide them around with her tiny fingers.  Once in a while her fingernails would nudge one, instead of pushing it.\n\nIt didn't look like she was about to kill me, so I wondered if maybe she wanted to be friendly.  All I've wanted since Cholita became homeless, and I had to protect her, was for her to sit close to me and be happy.\n\nI fixed the fuse by going outside, and walked back in and over to the table to watch her pretty hands moving the pieces of the puzzle around in little circles.  I tested how close she'd let me get before lurching at me.  As it turned out, surprisingly close.\n\nI noticed she never found a puzzle piece she could match into what she had so far.  She was just showing off her hands and hair. She never looked up so I could see her face.\n\nI returned to my room, only to find she blew the fuse 2 hours later.\n\nI was in the middle of trying to enter into my dreaming body, directly from waking. I wanted to return to the living room, but in my dreaming double.\n\nThere she was again, sitting at the same table.\n\nI went outside to fix the fuse. I returned and watched her for a while, noticing more clearly that her Chacmool hair was history. She'd decided to grow it back.\n\nAt this point, it was merely floppy.\n\nI watched her much longer than I usually dared. You can get injured if you annoy her.\n\nShe was looking down the entire time she was manipulating colored puzzle pieces.\n\nShe said, \"I'm not going to your bedroom.\"\n\nI was happy to hear that. Not because she wasn't, but because she was even thinking about it.\n\nI may be celibate, but I still like to get offers.  In fact, I suspect it's always downhill from there.\n\nFrom the first offer.\n\nThat's the real prize.\n\nShe finally looked up into my eyes and said, \u201cGo to your room now.\u201d\n\nIt was late enough at that point, that I needed to sleep or I\u2019d be tired the next day.\n\nShortly after I fell asleep, I found myself in the living room again.\n\nCholita was handing me little slices of reality. She had a stack of 4 of them in her hand, and was sorting through them.  We were both sitting on chairs, facing each other.\n\nSome of the slices of reality were as thick as a silver dollar.\n\nAll were about the size of the smaller collectable Japanese game cards.\n\nShe showed me that the thickest had the most activity in it. I could see buildings, cars, and skyscrapers. It was a busy city.\n\nCholita loves the pretty areas of Los Angeles. It might have been near Westwood except that the color of the light in that scene was unnaturally yellow.\n\nThe last time I saw a world of that color, it was contained inside a bundle of emanations, amidst the infinity of the emanations at large.\n\nI entered it by turning my head to gaze into it.\n\nCholita's playing cards were like miniature bundles of emanations.  You could enter them simply by glancing inside.\n\nShe saw that I wasn\u2019t interested in that one.\n\nI was thinking it was \"too thick\".\n\nShe sorted through the rest until she saw one that interested me.\n\nIt was the thinnest, but it contained very colorful images.  It was so thin that it was transparent, and the colorful things on it seemed to glow and float in the air by themselves.\n\nIt wasn't vast like the thick city playing card, where you could get lost with so much to do.\n\nThis one was happy, like a garden of colorful flowers.\n\nShe flipped it back and forth in her hand, so I could see the activity from both sides.\n\nThen she handed it to me.\n\nI suddenly found myself walking fast through a gigantic hotel common area, with beautiful rooms lining it on all sides, towering above several stories.  The landscaping was magnificent.\n\nIt was much like an expensive resort hotel in San Diego county, which had a walkway directly to the beach.  Cholita had gotten me to let her stay there, to calm her nerves. As a reward, she let me take pictures of her having fun.\n\nCholita loves beautiful hotels, ever since her father took her with him on business as a child, to some of the best hotels in Mexico.  Paid for by the government.\n\nI recognized my own room 3 floors above me and took to the endless stairs, such as you only find in dreaming.  I got lost for a while, but I have no memory of it.  Perhaps Cholita was playing hide and seek.  The entire time I was lost there, I felt that Cholita was just around the corner.\n\nI entered the room,  closed the door, and looked around to figure out what was going on.\n\nIt wasn't an ordinary dream. It was something else.  I couldn't recall seeing any other beings in that dream.  I only felt the presence of Cholita, always hiding and out of reach.\n\nI tried the faucet at the sink.  The room had a separate area for putting on makeup, with a large mirror, very bright lights, and a full sink and granite counter.  Cholita loves bright lights and a sink with mirror, for putting on her makeup.\n\nThe faucet worked.  I'm not sure why I expected otherwise.\n\nGlancing back at the door, I saw Cholita. She was sitting on the floor in an awkward position, as if she were intoxicated and had fallen over.  She was leaning on her elbows with her hands pressed to the carpet. Her head was turned down, looking at the floor.\n\nShe was helpless.\n\nAnd she was wearing a bikini.\n\nInstead of my normal reaction, wanting to stare at her and see if I could sneak out my camera phone and get away with making a video, I just took it for granted.\n\nI walked up to her and she said, \"Let\u2019s go for a swim in the ocean together.\"\n\nIn that world it was well past midnight and somehow I was certain that the ocean water was too cold for anything beyond wading out a few feet.\n\nI began to explain, that was too dangerous at this time of night.\n\nShe turned her head to look into my eyes, smiled a sort of grim smile, like a cat about to eat a mouse,  and I realized, if we went swimming we\u2019d both die.\n\nI considered whether it might not be worth it, to go for a swim with Cholita.\n\nI didn't read it until the next morning, but the passage Cholita had underlined, where the Nagual can result in your death, included a final warning.\n\nSometimes in the Nagual, you won't mind dying.\n\nEdited six times", "edited": 1585335532.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_flnr2uj", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And lets not forget, perhaps the entire sorcery thing is &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, it&amp;#39;s a better myth than the one we were born into, but all of them are just myths in the long run.

Could you elaborate which grounding does this statement has behind it? I wouldn't specifically agree. What I agree on is that Carlos Castaneda was a human being, like all of us, which means he had his own flaws and strengths (we all do have them!). But it doesn't mean his gifts to the world are not valuable. Indeed they are.\n\nAnd what is really cool is that we have a student of him, u/danl999 here who succeeded on going down some (full) paths suggested by Carlos. And some other guys who did it without having Carlos at their hand, but using his techniques as a basis. So the fact that Carlos is indeed a treasure for me is totally obvious. And Dan's presence here is a marvel as well.\n\nThere is of course the other side of it, which is still speculative to me and where I trust my instincts (not being able to validate it technically yet). I feel that the later books, starting from \"The Art of Dreaming\" are moving into different intent which is closer to this of ancient seers. You can feel it! It is focusing so much on inorganic beings and \"siddhis\" (I hate this word, but don't have a better one) and very little is spoken about warior's path, structiring and cleaning out the tonal island or stalking. Maybe Carlos just wanted to give techniques providing dramatic result for people to get interested and practice. This is debatable, but in earlier books it was clearly described that the new seera seeking freedom put stalking of oneself and impeccability as a 1 priority number one. Because a tonal transformed properly directs the shifts of the assemblage point and makes it assemble other great bands, providing necessary boost of energy. Also, it helps to have less inner dialogue. It also helps to avoid lateral shifts and detaches our awareness from focusing on the elements of our ordinary reality, like pettiness, neediness, being jealous, willing personal gains.. And lets us drift into other realities with less baggage and being more empty when coupled with silence.

It looks like some \"quintessence\" of magical practices like the pomegranate dot/reading energy, gates of dreaming, intending silence, summoning allies to get results as quick as possible (maybe because Carlos wanted to give a chance to more people and had a very limited time). Maybe some guys would disagree, but the more I get to practice myself and look into how others do it, the more I think that if we do only this, we can end up in old seers situation - having big knowledge, big magical powers and gains, but not having a clean tonal and sobriety to deal with it properly. Of course there is a big risk to end up in some mind calming placebo while trying to work with tonal. But I am sure it can also be avoided if you truly work.

There's no place get more reading material, so he cherishes the encyclopedias.\n\nThose are like the 17 books and publications  of Carlos and the witches.\n\nBut then the Evil Walmart (I'm a fan of lower prices), builds a giant library right next door to the guy, killing all the mom and pop outlets for knowledge.\n\nThe encyclopedias lose their value, when there's a megalibrary right next door.\n\nKeep in mind, that megalibrary in this story is silent knowledge. It's not more fake sorcery books.\n\nIt's all legitimate \"Walmart verified\" knowledge.\n\nI'm making a joke there, but it's not such a bad one.  Our political opinions, such as that walmart is evil because it harms \"the little guy\" and ruins union jobs,  ignoring that objects of just as good quality as other places are 1/3rd price there, is a gloss.  And that Walmart helps \"the little guy\" more than a mom and pop business.\n\n\"Walmart is Evil\" is an opinion that falsely guides people to ignore reality in favor of dubious opinions based on public chatter.  On the flow of angry internal dialogues in the river of shit.\n\nIt's very good to avoid those!  For instance, \"wokeness\" is just plain evil.  I couldn't have dared to say that, until Elon Musk said it too.  He's the smartest and wealthiest man in the world, or close to it, so I can say it with some authority now.\n\nPolitical movements create angry glosses in the mind, causing people to behave like river of shit inhabitants flinging shit onto the faces of others, and pissing on anyone not in their opinion group.\n\nTry to keep those river of shit hobbies away from yourself, if you want to learn sorcery.\n\nBut reading the books of Carlos and group, also implants such opinions and theories.\n\nThe difference is where they come from.  Those in the books come from Silent Knowledge.  And Silent Knowledge is only what \"is\".  Not what the river of shit likes to invent, out of anger.\n\nUnfortunately, this subreddit interferes with those embedded opinions placed in the books of Carlos, by silent knowledge.\n\nIf the new people who come here never read the books, they'd have an unexpected collection of \"opinions\" about sorcery.  Not the ones Carlos intended.\n\nThere's nothing to be done about that because the entire Castaneda community is already completely contaminated with failure.  So telling people to go away for a while to read the books so they can absorb the intent of sorcery as intended by don Juan, is not going to work.\n\nThey'll end up as \"Buddha boys\", or \"Astral travelers\".  And further damage the community beyond just themselves.\n\nPeople pretending their magic!\n\nIf they go too far down that path their hopes to learn sorcery are ruined forever.\n\nIt's not me making that claim.  It's don Juan and his \"list\" of rules (enemies) in the path of learning to become a \"Man of Knowledge\".\n\nKeep in mind, don Juan was explaining the path of knowledge we must take, to reach \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nBut he did it from several points of view in the narrative of the books.\n\nI prefer his narrative of teaching Carlos to be a hunter. It isn't \"tainted\" the way the \"Man of Knowledge\" path is.\n\nTainted with greed.\n\nBut that Man of Knowledge path has harder edged rules governing it, because in fact trying to learn real magic has a finality to it.  If you fail at any step it's an exit from the pursuit.\n\nFailure to pass any of the obstacles (enemies) is the end of your journey.\n\nSo for example if you succumb to the \"first enemy of a man of knowledge\", then you have not been able to overcome  your fear (of iobs?) and you are doomed to become something ugly, personality wise.\n\nI can't remember what he said it was, but something like a frightened, small petty man.\n\nDon't worry, don Juan gave an out for someone who fails and then later changes their mind.\n\nHe said they actually never gave up, so they didn't really fail. And not overcoming an enemy and being kicked off the path, only applied to someone who was fully defeated. Not to someone who was still interested but just taking a break.\n\nIn fact, the path of sorcery requires that you quit at some point, and rethink it.  When the Nagual leaves he blows up the group, and all the apprentices fight and begin to curse their nagual leader.\n\nIt's part of \"the rule\".  Second Ring of Power details it.\n\nBut we're in that part of the rule ourselves!  Carlos blew up his group too, and we're trying to duplicate second ring of power and put it back together.\n\nSecond Ring  of Power is all about \"practical magic\", so don't let that point escape you. I'll go into practical magic and it's benefits in detail later.\n\nCarlos went to find out what was going on with the apprentices of don Juan, and found some wild flowers coming up in the fertile soil don Juan had created.  Actual magic, and not just coming from the awe inspiring previous lineage.\n\nIt was magic from pathetic apprentices.\n\nSo to borrow the \"5 enemies of a man of knowledge\" list, but for a \"sorcery student\",  namely a person who wants to learn to \"see\", there is also a list of enemies you must overcome.  And failing to overcome any one is death to your path.\n\nThe end of it.\n\n\"Sorcery student\" is what we need to be.  Don't be a student wanting to become a \"Man of Knowledge\".  That's like wanting to become a junk dealer when you grow up.  Or a fake fortune teller.\n\nThe path of a sorcery student is somewhat obvious.  We don't think in those terms, but when you get to silent knowledge you get lists of obvious things you ought to have known yourself, but were too preoccupied with flinging shit in the river to notice them.\n\nFor new people, don Juan said all of mankind lives in a river of shit, throwing feces at each other all day long, or pissing on their legs when they aren't quite as angry.\n\nWe're all up to our necks in it and the only escape is on the dry land outside the river, where Sorcerers live.\n\nI don't know this full new list of the \"enemies of a sorcery student\", which came from Silent Knowledge\n\nI only heard 2 or 3 items.\n\nThere's no reason to get everything in Silent knowledge.  It's not possible.  Sorcerers are doomed to having only partial lists like that. But the rest of the list is embedded in just 2 of the first.  A topic, and the flow.  The presentation method.\n\nFor instance \"the abstract cores\" of which we have only 21.  The number is infinite, but we only got the first few ones.  All of them stories.\n\nSorcerers teach with stories!   It's possible they ALWAYS do that. I never paid attention myself, while reading the books.\n\nBut the story becomes a phantom reality, and Silent Knowledge can flow well inside phantom realities.  INTENT itself, can store in phantom containers of any sort.\n\nSo the path of a \"sorcery student\" is as follows:\n\nHopeful (that the books are true)\n\nOptimistic (because you did some work and saw results)\n\nCurious (because it's working, and you begin to wonder about practical magic).\n\nYou go from wishful thinking to \"WTF? Can it be true???\", to realizing it is true at least in some way, and how much more real can it get?\n\nSo you try to learn practical magic.\n\nPractical magic means you can actually repeat something absolutely impossible and cooler than anything any Buddhist ever claimed.\n\nIt's REAL magic.\n\nBut to get there you have to overcome the first 2 \"obstacles\" of a sorcery student.\n\nThe \"enemy\" at the first rule is laziness.   To overcome the \"hopeful\" stage, you have to actually try it.\n\n99 out of 100 (this subreddit has nearly proven that) fail at the first enemy.  For whatever reason, their hopefulness  will not overcome their laziness.\n\nWhen it's obvious they aren't going to get off their fat butt, they tend to curse the whole thing as having been \"made up\".\n\nAnd have plenty of outside encouragement by bad men to believe that.\n\nDefeated by the first enemy of a student of Sorcery.\n\nThe second barrier for  a sorcery student is \"Optimistic\".\n\nYou have to pass from Optimistic to curious.  So you can reach \"practical magic\".  Only there is it undeniable that sorcery is real.  When you can do some yourself!\n\nAt the optimistic stage the river of shit is filled with \"excuses\" for why what you saw, or experienced, doesn't count. Those puffs of purple?  Just how the eye works in darkness.  A \"malfunction\".\n\nAnd here's the ugly side of the entire Castaneda community.\n\nThe enemy of the optimistic sorcery student, is pretending.\n\nOnce you are fully involved with pretending, you are forever off the path of a sorcery student.\n\nWhen you start to believe in Astral Travel, you are screwed.\n\nIt's the end of the line for  you.\n\nOr when you start to pretend that your ordinary dreams are sorcery progress, especially hinting that belief is justified by \"Art of Dreaming\" despite never following the instructions, you are doomed.\n\nYou have unhooked yourself from the path of a sorcery student, to jump back in the river of shit and try to force others in there to treat you better.  Because you're a pretend magic man.\n\nIt's the pretending and distortion of ordinary dreams into \"magic\" that destroys most people.\n\nThe whole community in fact.  Even people \"in charge\" have succumb to the second enemy of sorcery students.\n\nPretending.\n\nBut if people can pass the second barrier and make it to the third, \"curious\", the process of trying to learn \"practical magic\" becomes very informative.\n\nBy the way before I forget, the third \"enemy\" is impatience.  You have to learn that you are waiting for your will  (intent) to get your practical magic to work as well as you hoped.\n\nAnd one thing you will discover trying to do that is, Carlos gave us 2 paths to practical magic.\n\nI suppose there's dozens of \"complete paths\" to \"**learn\"** sorcery.\n\nSuch as recap, gazing, not-doings, dreaming, stalking.\n\nPeople complain about this subreddit only teaching one thing, but that's their own fault.\n\nWe have peanut butter cookies.\n\nWe're very sorry if you hate those.  Please bring your own and feel free to share.\n\nBut not mudpies, substituted for real cookies. We get too many mud pie cookies in here already.\n\nAnyway, I don't mean those kinds of \"complete paths\".\n\nI mean, 2 main paths you can travel to learn practical magic.\n\nInside dreams, or outside them.\n\nMost people are pretending to take the \"inside dreams\" path, because it's easy to lie about your ordinary dreams to make them seem magical, and you can bully people and throw a tantrum if they question your honesty.\n\nHurl shit in their face.\n\nThank god for Mods!\n\nI wish IOBs were that proactive...\n\nAside from that,  in the course of doing practical magic you will find that whatever you \"picked\" to try  falls under one of the hidden paths to power, from the books. Waking dreaming, versus sleeping dreaming.\n\nWhen I run into a serious question about sorcery I like to think that \"Don Juan already covered that topic somewhere for us in case it came up.\"\n\nBut if you find yourself at the first 2 barriers of a sorcery student, that claim can seem ballsy.\n\nOver assuming.\n\nNope.  As it turns out, we all have full access to don Juan.\n\nLive, in real time!\n\nEveryday, as long you can afford the long walk to go see him.\n\nHe's available as an SKE, at the end of a very tall hill.\n\nA silent knowledge entity.\n\nLike Nestor's \"Porfirio\".\n\nThis might explain sincere people who claim \"Carlos visited me\".\n\nCould be.  But more likely is:   Lying bastard who misrepresents his dreams.\n\nStill, don Juan is truly \"out there\".  I don't recommend that \"presentation method\", and neither did don Juan.\n\nHe recommended becoming a \"reader of infinity\".\n\nIt's harder to get attached to written text knowledge, and mess things up by sliding the assemblage point sideways.\n\nIf you saw my Wuwonian stories, messing things up would be if you actually walked inside the dream bubble in which I got to watch those stories of the wuwonians.\n\nIt was visible. But I was not \"in there\".\n\nWhich is a choice.  Silent Knowledge video presentations fully allow  you to walk into the video, as a \"virtual reality\".  It's just a short horizontal slide of the assemblage point to go in to the dream bubble.\n\nSo \"don Juan\" did give us all the advice we'd ever need in the books, and if an obscure topic is missing he showed us how to travel to him to ask in person.\n\nThis is where a practical example of \"practical magic\" would be helpful to explain this line of thought.\n\nBut I can't. Others are involved.\n\nLet's just say that my approach is to create a phantom room, and give it a purpose.  So I have a place I can go to, for that form of practical magic.\n\nI'm creating a \"dream bubble\", or a phantom skimming of the emanations, so it can be specifically for one thing only.\n\nThe little sisters seemed to  have done something similar with their practical magic technique of running around a room in circles, until they could literally run on the walls.\n\nSounds impossible?\n\nNot at all.  That one is fairly easy.  There's  a trick to it, which when not understood makes it sound too incredible to believe.\n\nThe trick is, when the double comes out because it's interested in what your Tonal body (your organic body) is doing, there's a \"smooth transition\" to fully being inside the double.\n\nAnd the double LOVES practical magic!!!  He'll come out, you can be sure of that.\n\nWhere the tonal goes, no one can say.\n\nSo they only say it, \"shrinks\".  When sorcerers \"bury themselves\" in order to extend their lifespan to thousands of years, I suppose it could be that they \"shrink the Tonal\" while buried.  And leave it there.  They perhaps \"borrow\" the earth as a container.\n\nSo we know that running on the walls is possible, because the little sisters were not learning to do that \"impossible\" thing.\n\nThey were learning to \"run into their doubles\".\n\nTheir doubles could run on the walls.\n\nGenaro showed us later in the books, to make sure we weren't confused.\n\nI truly doubt anyone can do that in their organic body.\n\nBut if you run into someone who can, run like hell!  That sort of power in a petty organic being would be very ugly.\n\nIn the case of the little sisters, they started in the waking world and their practical magic took them into a dream of the room.\n\nA waking dream, but still a dream bubble phantom reality.\n\nOthers could share it with them.\n\nAnd in fact, \"others\" from inside full on dreaming, the kind we usually experience while sleeping, namely their own \"doubles\" ran out of the dream and into the waking dreaming bubble.\n\nThose awake, used silence to go directly into a dream.\n\nThose in a dream (their own doubles), went into a dream bubble, inside their dream.\n\nThey executed the 3rd gate of dreaming!\n\nI suppose they might have used the 4th gate to appear in the \"real world\", but there's no need.\n\nThe third gate is easier than the 4th.\n\nNaturally the hope would be to finally emerge into the \"real copy of the room\".  But first a dream bubble,  a \"dream within a dream\",  would work just fine.\n\nBut always remember, don't try to do 2 things at the same time as far as \"major accomplishments\" go when learning practical magic.\n\nThat's the book deal mind again!  The \"pretending\" enemy of students of sorcery.\n\nWe see that all the time in this subreddit. A beginner will pile on \"things I'm going to do first\".  And of course, never do even one of them.\n\nDon't try to become President, but also try to become Elon Musk at the same time!\n\nThey're different things!\n\nWhen doing practical magic between 2 people, there are 4 combinations.\n\nHunter / Dreamer\n\nA binary number of 2 bits.\n\nI use \"hunter\" to refer to a sorcery student who is awake and in his tonal body.\n\nWith Hunter / Dreamer, one person's abilities are stronger in '\"dreaming awake\".\n\nAnd the other with sleeping dreaming.\n\nThey are \"different realms\".\n\nKeep in mind, this point of view might clear up the confusion over Taisha and Florinda.\n\nTaisha is supposed to be the stalker.  And yet, her books are filled with waking dreaming.\n\nBut that's what the \"hunter\" does!  So the distinction might just be where a person is \"grounded\".  In waking dreaming, or in sleeping dreaming.\n\nIt's only confusing because of the pretending in the Castaneda community.  The lazy \"pretend\" their dreaming experiences. The lazy who can never remember any dreams, \"pretend\" to be stalking.  So they also can suck up attention from others, as pretend \"magic men\".\n\nIn practical magic situations, the person using their sleeping dreaming powers falls under \"The Art of Dreaming\" rules.\n\nThe Gates!   Remember the gates if you go down that path.\n\nWomen are very suitable for creating practical magic, starting in sleeping dreaming.\n\nMen, being the lying bastards they are, are only interested in stealing money and attention from others. They should avoid too much interest in sleeping dreaming until they can reach Silent Knowledge.\n\nAvoid, but if it's all you have then double check yourself for the second enemy:  pretending.  And it goes without saying, you can't be lazy either.   Intent \"builds up\" and skipping a day of practice is much more harmful than just missing one session. It \"damages the flow\".\n\nBut men ideally ought to use the path of the hunter. Not the dreamer.\n\nThe hunter is capable of waking dreaming, and that's the best path for a male.\n\nYou can't fake that.\n\nThe good news is, in a 2 partner practical magic situation both parties don't have to be using the same set of rules.\n\nIdeally, it's hunter/hunter.  Both using dreaming awake, to develop elaborate practical magic.\n\nLike the Little Sisters running around a room.\n\nBut you can have dreamer/dreamer.\n\nThat would be La Gorda finding her way to Emilito, where Josefina had already arrived to go exploring beyond the wall of fog.\n\nThe problem with that combination is,  you need an Emilito.\n\nSomeone to whom a poor sorcerer could find their way, due to the power of that particular dreamer.\n\nI don't recall any examples of La Gorda and Josefina doing dreamer/dreamer practical magic alone.\n\nIn fact when they tried around Zuleica, Josefina swished into her colors and vanished from La Gorda's presence.\n\nThe combination of hunter/dreamer, which if it's the opposite dreamer/hunter, let's just say the first is a male (the first in the group of 2) as the waking dreamer, and a female as the sleeping dreamer.\n\nI predict that's the most successful combination for beginner's practical magic.  One is \"fully lucid\". the Waking dreamer.  The other is \"flexible\", and only half lucid.\n\nBut the combination is a killer!!!\n\nCholita and I have a very fun time with that combination of her irrationality in her double, and my \"excessive\" lucidity, being fully awake when we interact in dreams.\n\nAnd the second combination, with the woman being the waking dreamer and the male the sleeping dreamer, is something I'd sure like to see but expect I never will.\n\nFor reasons that are obvious from what I said earlier.\n\nMen pretend.  I can't imagine any man learning sorcery though sleeping dreaming.\n\nMore likely is if they decided to be that lazy,  but won't accept pretending, they'd turn into damaged power plant junkies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Enemies of a Sorcery Student", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 136, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"52syvhobbm291": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 104, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/52syvhobbm291.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72f9312b395ba2922abcf9469ef2aedbda0c8814"}, {"y": 209, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/52syvhobbm291.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ce2834a6d404dd6b622625f94a304bb7491e0af"}, {"y": 311, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/52syvhobbm291.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d2a61d4ca7ac9f58c204c778cb99ff709304365"}, {"y": 622, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/52syvhobbm291.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=343fc99e571e08363871616f5be59abf9d0d8124"}, {"y": 933, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/52syvhobbm291.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89c06687cb58c6bc18732aea4471a4f24d4fa219"}, {"y": 1049, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/52syvhobbm291.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55a0f08ecbcf9173f000c0091a5596a71fba57dc"}], "s": {"y": 1458, "x": 1500, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/52syvhobbm291.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4409fa0b933c3c3914fa5f164cb575c752dd1e1"}, "id": "52syvhobbm291"}}, "name": "t3_v0y1hx", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 35, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 35, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/s2Tf937-9F_llQS3qHFAV56s403pQ5QnIrOQloOULUA.jpg", "edited": 1653922976.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1653909790.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/52syvhobbm291.png?width=1500&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d4409fa0b933c3c3914fa5f164cb575c752dd1e1\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/52syvhobbm291.png?width=1500&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d4409fa0b933c3c3914fa5f164cb575c752dd1e1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silent Knowledge, our goal, leaks through at all stages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you finally get there for the full on experience it&amp;#39;s a tiny bit like being some guy who lives in the middle of nowhere, and only has a set of old encyclopedias to read.

It&amp;#39;s not more fake sorcery books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all legitimate &amp;quot;Walmart verified&amp;quot; knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m making a joke there, but it&amp;#39;s not such a bad one.  Our political opinions, such as that walmart is evil because it harms &amp;quot;the little guy&amp;quot; and ruins union jobs,  ignoring that objects of just as good quality as other places are 1/3rd price there, is a gloss.  And that Walmart helps &amp;quot;the little guy&amp;quot; more than a mom and pop business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Walmart is Evil&amp;quot; is an opinion that falsely guides people to ignore reality in favor of dubious opinions based on public chatter.  On the flow of angry internal dialogues in the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very good to avoid those!  For instance, &amp;quot;wokeness&amp;quot; is just plain evil.  I couldn&amp;#39;t have dared to say that, until Elon Musk said it too.  He&amp;#39;s the smartest and wealthiest man in the world, or close to it, so I can say it with some authority now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Political movements create angry glosses in the mind, causing people to behave like river of shit inhabitants flinging shit onto the faces of others, and pissing on anyone not in their opinion group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to keep those river of shit hobbies away from yourself, if you want to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But reading the books of Carlos and group, also implants such opinions and theories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The difference is where they come from.  Those in the books come from Silent Knowledge.  And Silent Knowledge is only what &amp;quot;is&amp;quot;.  Not what the river of shit likes to invent, out of anger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this subreddit interferes with those embedded opinions placed in the books of Carlos, by silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the new people who come here never read the books, they&amp;#39;d have an unexpected collection of &amp;quot;opinions&amp;quot; about sorcery.  Not the ones Carlos intended.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing to be done about that because the entire Castaneda community is already completely contaminated with failure.  So telling people to go away for a while to read the books so they can absorb the intent of sorcery as intended by don Juan, is not going to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll end up as &amp;quot;Buddha boys&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Astral travelers&amp;quot;.  And further damage the community beyond just themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People pretending their magic!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they go too far down that path their hopes to learn sorcery are ruined forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not me making that claim.  It&amp;#39;s don Juan and his &amp;quot;list&amp;quot; of rules (enemies) in the path of learning to become a &amp;quot;Man of Knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, don Juan was explaining the path of knowledge we must take, to reach &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he did it from several points of view in the narrative of the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I prefer his narrative of teaching Carlos to be a hunter. It isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;tainted&amp;quot; the way the &amp;quot;Man of Knowledge&amp;quot; path is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tainted with greed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that Man of Knowledge path has harder edged rules governing it, because in fact trying to learn real magic has a finality to it.  If you fail at any step it&amp;#39;s an exit from the pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Failure to pass any of the obstacles (enemies) is the end of your journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for example if you succumb to the &amp;quot;first enemy of a man of knowledge&amp;quot;, then you have not been able to overcome  your fear (of iobs?) and you are doomed to become something ugly, personality wise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t remember what he said it was, but something like a frightened, small petty man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry, don Juan gave an out for someone who fails and then later changes their mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said they actually never gave up, so they didn&amp;#39;t really fail. And not overcoming an enemy and being kicked off the path, only applied to someone who was fully defeated. Not to someone who was still interested but just taking a break.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, the path of sorcery requires that you quit at some point, and rethink it.  When the Nagual leaves he blows up the group, and all the apprentices fight and begin to curse their nagual leader.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s part of &amp;quot;the rule&amp;quot;.  Second Ring of Power details it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#39;re in that part of the rule ourselves!  Carlos blew up his group too, and we&amp;#39;re trying to duplicate second ring of power and put it back together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second Ring  of Power is all about &amp;quot;practical magic&amp;quot;, so don&amp;#39;t let that point escape you. I&amp;#39;ll go into practical magic and it&amp;#39;s benefits in detail later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos went to find out what was going on with the apprentices of don Juan, and found some wild flowers coming up in the fertile soil don Juan had created.  Actual magic, and not just coming from the awe inspiring previous lineage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was magic from pathetic apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to borrow the &amp;quot;5 enemies of a man of knowledge&amp;quot; list, but for a &amp;quot;sorcery student&amp;quot;,  namely a person who wants to learn to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;, there is also a list of enemies you must overcome.  And failing to overcome any one is death to your path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The end of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorcery student&amp;quot; is what we need to be.  Don&amp;#39;t be a student wanting to become a &amp;quot;Man of Knowledge&amp;quot;.  That&amp;#39;s like wanting to become a junk dealer when you grow up.  Or a fake fortune teller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The path of a sorcery student is somewhat obvious.  We don&amp;#39;t think in those terms, but when you get to silent knowledge you get lists of obvious things you ought to have known yourself, but were too preoccupied with flinging shit in the river to notice them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For new people, don Juan said all of mankind lives in a river of shit, throwing feces at each other all day long, or pissing on their legs when they aren&amp;#39;t quite as angry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re all up to our necks in it and the only escape is on the dry land outside the river, where Sorcerers live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know this full new list of the &amp;quot;enemies of a sorcery student&amp;quot;, which came from Silent Knowledge&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only heard 2 or 3 items.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no reason to get everything in Silent knowledge.  It&amp;#39;s not possible.  Sorcerers are doomed to having only partial lists like that. But the rest of the list is embedded in just 2 of the first.  A topic, and the flow.  The presentation method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance &amp;quot;the abstract cores&amp;quot; of which we have only 21.  The number is infinite, but we only got the first few ones.  All of them stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers teach with stories!   It&amp;#39;s possible they ALWAYS do that. I never paid attention myself, while reading the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the story becomes a phantom reality, and Silent Knowledge can flow well inside phantom realities.  INTENT itself, can store in phantom containers of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the path of a &amp;quot;sorcery student&amp;quot; is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopeful (that the books are true)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Optimistic (because you did some work and saw results)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Curious (because it&amp;#39;s working, and you begin to wonder about practical magic).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You go from wishful thinking to &amp;quot;WTF? Can it be true???&amp;quot;, to realizing it is true at least in some way, and how much more real can it get?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you try to learn practical magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Practical magic means you can actually repeat something absolutely impossible and cooler than anything any Buddhist ever claimed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s REAL magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to get there you have to overcome the first 2 &amp;quot;obstacles&amp;quot; of a sorcery student.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;enemy&amp;quot; at the first rule is laziness.   To overcome the &amp;quot;hopeful&amp;quot; stage, you have to actually try it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;99 out of 100 (this subreddit has nearly proven that) fail at the first enemy.  For whatever reason, their hopefulness  will not overcome their laziness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s obvious they aren&amp;#39;t going to get off their fat butt, they tend to curse the whole thing as having been &amp;quot;made up&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And have plenty of outside encouragement by bad men to believe that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Defeated by the first enemy of a student of Sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second barrier for  a sorcery student is &amp;quot;Optimistic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to pass from Optimistic to curious.  So you can reach &amp;quot;practical magic&amp;quot;.  Only there is it undeniable that sorcery is real.  When you can do some yourself!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the optimistic stage the river of shit is filled with &amp;quot;excuses&amp;quot; for why what you saw, or experienced, doesn&amp;#39;t count. Those puffs of purple?  Just how the eye works in darkness.  A &amp;quot;malfunction&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s the ugly side of the entire Castaneda community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The enemy of the optimistic sorcery student, is pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you are fully involved with pretending, you are forever off the path of a sorcery student.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you start to believe in Astral Travel, you are screwed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the end of the line for  you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or when you start to pretend that your ordinary dreams are sorcery progress, especially hinting that belief is justified by &amp;quot;Art of Dreaming&amp;quot; despite never following the instructions, you are doomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have unhooked yourself from the path of a sorcery student, to jump back in the river of shit and try to force others in there to treat you better.  Because you&amp;#39;re a pretend magic man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the pretending and distortion of ordinary dreams into &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; that destroys most people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The whole community in fact.  Even people &amp;quot;in charge&amp;quot; have succumb to the second enemy of sorcery students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if people can pass the second barrier and make it to the third, &amp;quot;curious&amp;quot;, the process of trying to learn &amp;quot;practical magic&amp;quot; becomes very informative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way before I forget, the third &amp;quot;enemy&amp;quot; is impatience.  You have to learn that you are waiting for your will  (intent) to get your practical magic to work as well as you hoped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And one thing you will discover trying to do that is, Carlos gave us 2 paths to practical magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose there&amp;#39;s dozens of &amp;quot;complete paths&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;learn&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as recap, gazing, not-doings, dreaming, stalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People complain about this subreddit only teaching one thing, but that&amp;#39;s their own fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have peanut butter cookies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re very sorry if you hate those.  Please bring your own and feel free to share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not mudpies, substituted for real cookies. We get too many mud pie cookies in here already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don&amp;#39;t mean those kinds of &amp;quot;complete paths&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, 2 main paths you can travel to learn practical magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside dreams, or outside them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people are pretending to take the &amp;quot;inside dreams&amp;quot; path, because it&amp;#39;s easy to lie about your ordinary dreams to make them seem magical, and you can bully people and throw a tantrum if they question your honesty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hurl shit in their face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank god for Mods!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish IOBs were that proactive...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from that,  in the course of doing practical magic you will find that whatever you &amp;quot;picked&amp;quot; to try  falls under one of the hidden paths to power, from the books. Waking dreaming, versus sleeping dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I run into a serious question about sorcery I like to think that &amp;quot;Don Juan already covered that topic somewhere for us in case it came up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you find yourself at the first 2 barriers of a sorcery student, that claim can seem ballsy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over assuming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope.  As it turns out, we all have full access to don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Live, in real time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyday, as long you can afford the long walk to go see him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s available as an SKE, at the end of a very tall hill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A silent knowledge entity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Nestor&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Porfirio&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This might explain sincere people who claim &amp;quot;Carlos visited me&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be.  But more likely is:   Lying bastard who misrepresents his dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, don Juan is truly &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot;.  I don&amp;#39;t recommend that &amp;quot;presentation method&amp;quot;, and neither did don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He recommended becoming a &amp;quot;reader of infinity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s harder to get attached to written text knowledge, and mess things up by sliding the assemblage point sideways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you saw my Wuwonian stories, messing things up would be if you actually walked inside the dream bubble in which I got to watch those stories of the wuwonians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was visible. But I was not &amp;quot;in there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is a choice.  Silent Knowledge video presentations fully allow  you to walk into the video, as a &amp;quot;virtual reality&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s just a short horizontal slide of the assemblage point to go in to the dream bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;don Juan&amp;quot; did give us all the advice we&amp;#39;d ever need in the books, and if an obscure topic is missing he showed us how to travel to him to ask in person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where a practical example of &amp;quot;practical magic&amp;quot; would be helpful to explain this line of thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can&amp;#39;t. Others are involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s just say that my approach is to create a phantom room, and give it a purpose.  So I have a place I can go to, for that form of practical magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m creating a &amp;quot;dream bubble&amp;quot;, or a phantom skimming of the emanations, so it can be specifically for one thing only.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little sisters seemed to  have done something similar with their practical magic technique of running around a room in circles, until they could literally run on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds impossible?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not at all.  That one is fairly easy.  There&amp;#39;s  a trick to it, which when not understood makes it sound too incredible to believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The trick is, when the double comes out because it&amp;#39;s interested in what your Tonal body (your organic body) is doing, there&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;smooth transition&amp;quot; to fully being inside the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the double LOVES practical magic!!!  He&amp;#39;ll come out, you can be sure of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where the tonal goes, no one can say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they only say it, &amp;quot;shrinks&amp;quot;.  When sorcerers &amp;quot;bury themselves&amp;quot; in order to extend their lifespan to thousands of years, I suppose it could be that they &amp;quot;shrink the Tonal&amp;quot; while buried.  And leave it there.  They perhaps &amp;quot;borrow&amp;quot; the earth as a container.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we know that running on the walls is possible, because the little sisters were not learning to do that &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot; thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were learning to &amp;quot;run into their doubles&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their doubles could run on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Genaro showed us later in the books, to make sure we weren&amp;#39;t confused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I truly doubt anyone can do that in their organic body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you run into someone who can, run like hell!  That sort of power in a petty organic being would be very ugly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of the little sisters, they started in the waking world and their practical magic took them into a dream of the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A waking dream, but still a dream bubble phantom reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others could share it with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in fact, &amp;quot;others&amp;quot; from inside full on dreaming, the kind we usually experience while sleeping, namely their own &amp;quot;doubles&amp;quot; ran out of the dream and into the waking dreaming bubble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those awake, used silence to go directly into a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those in a dream (their own doubles), went into a dream bubble, inside their dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They executed the 3rd gate of dreaming!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose they might have used the 4th gate to appear in the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;, but there&amp;#39;s no need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The third gate is easier than the 4th.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally the hope would be to finally emerge into the &amp;quot;real copy of the room&amp;quot;.  But first a dream bubble,  a &amp;quot;dream within a dream&amp;quot;,  would work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But always remember, don&amp;#39;t try to do 2 things at the same time as far as &amp;quot;major accomplishments&amp;quot; go when learning practical magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the book deal mind again!  The &amp;quot;pretending&amp;quot; enemy of students of sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We see that all the time in this subreddit. A beginner will pile on &amp;quot;things I&amp;#39;m going to do first&amp;quot;.  And of course, never do even one of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t try to become President, but also try to become Elon Musk at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re different things!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When doing practical magic between 2 people, there are 4 combinations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hunter / Dreamer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A binary number of 2 bits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use &amp;quot;hunter&amp;quot; to refer to a sorcery student who is awake and in his tonal body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With Hunter / Dreamer, one person&amp;#39;s abilities are stronger in &amp;#39;&amp;quot;dreaming awake&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the other with sleeping dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are &amp;quot;different realms&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, this point of view might clear up the confusion over Taisha and Florinda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taisha is supposed to be the stalker.  And yet, her books are filled with waking dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s what the &amp;quot;hunter&amp;quot; does!  So the distinction might just be where a person is &amp;quot;grounded&amp;quot;.  In waking dreaming, or in sleeping dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only confusing because of the pretending in the Castaneda community.  The lazy &amp;quot;pretend&amp;quot; their dreaming experiences. The lazy who can never remember any dreams, &amp;quot;pretend&amp;quot; to be stalking.  So they also can suck up attention from others, as pretend &amp;quot;magic men&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In practical magic situations, the person using their sleeping dreaming powers falls under &amp;quot;The Art of Dreaming&amp;quot; rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Gates!   Remember the gates if you go down that path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women are very suitable for creating practical magic, starting in sleeping dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men, being the lying bastards they are, are only interested in stealing money and attention from others. They should avoid too much interest in sleeping dreaming until they can reach Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Avoid, but if it&amp;#39;s all you have then double check yourself for the second enemy:  pretending.  And it goes without saying, you can&amp;#39;t be lazy either.   Intent &amp;quot;builds up&amp;quot; and skipping a day of practice is much more harmful than just missing one session. It &amp;quot;damages the flow&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But men ideally ought to use the path of the hunter. Not the dreamer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hunter is capable of waking dreaming, and that&amp;#39;s the best path for a male.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t fake that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good news is, in a 2 partner practical magic situation both parties don&amp;#39;t have to be using the same set of rules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally, it&amp;#39;s hunter/hunter.  Both using dreaming awake, to develop elaborate practical magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the Little Sisters running around a room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can have dreamer/dreamer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That would be La Gorda finding her way to Emilito, where Josefina had already arrived to go exploring beyond the wall of fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with that combination is,  you need an Emilito.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone to whom a poor sorcerer could find their way, due to the power of that particular dreamer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t recall any examples of La Gorda and Josefina doing dreamer/dreamer practical magic alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact when they tried around Zuleica, Josefina swished into her colors and vanished from La Gorda&amp;#39;s presence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The combination of hunter/dreamer, which if it&amp;#39;s the opposite dreamer/hunter, let&amp;#39;s just say the first is a male (the first in the group of 2) as the waking dreamer, and a female as the sleeping dreamer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I predict that&amp;#39;s the most successful combination for beginner&amp;#39;s practical magic.

We went for a long walk on that day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for keeping this virtual room full of Intent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HO!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/v0y1hx/the_enemies_of_a_sorcery_student/iasv6qe/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1654100159.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_v0y1hx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "khc9e8u", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Actual-Fennel5072", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ianz1mh", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_9ypkfhykw", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "This single post just filled in a shit ton of Gaps in my knowledge.

What's the point?  When they break, a new probe is sent out.\n\nThe cool part for sorcerers is, each piece of that \"free energy\" of the double is sentient all by itself.

Does that make any sense?\n\nBut you can certainly make multiple \"doubles\" of yourself.\n\nA tiny one standing on the floor, and a larger one right next to you.\n\nOr 6 tiny ones, and a ghost like full sized one.\n\nWe don't pretend our magic!  It's all fully visible, and there are no \"theories\" or \"beliefs\" we uphold without seeing it ourselves often.  Awake.  Eyes open.\n\nNot in a semi-nightmare as Astral Travel people do.\n\nOnce you have access to the awareness of your other half, you can use it to shift your normal awareness into new ranges.  New perceptions.  \"Higher states of consciousness\".\n\nJust by playing with the other awareness and learning to combine it with your organic body's awareness.\n\nOr you can use it to mold gigantic objects, like a freeway overpass you can actually see and climb on.\n\nA dirt road down the middle of your practice room.

You can!!!\n\nBut that would inevitably lead to discovering all that sorcerers have discovered.\n\nBecause we're all using the same reality.\n\nIf there's a form of magic not like our own sorcery, I've never seen it. And I have thousands of followers, who would love to surprise me with something new they found.\n\nNever have.  \n\nAnd it makes sense to a sorcerer, that humans only have 1 form of magic available to them.\n\nIn the case of \"Astral Travelers\", they aren't even doing what they claim.\n\nThe lie is not just the topic of \"Astral Travel\".\n\nThe lie is that they aren't even doing that!\n\nThey've had a few bad dreams they were somewhat aware of, and they spun those into a story to tell others in that fake magic community, to get a little attention for themselves.\n\nThis ought to be obvious to you, since you seem to hang out in such a community.\n\nWhere there's never actually any reason to believe some magic is being learned.\n\nIt's just endless attention seeking.\n\nSo \"Astral Travel\" starts off by giving you the false idea that your organic body is a \"garage\" for your soul.\n\nA lie.  It's just not so.  You have no \"soul\".\n\nAnd it teaches you to pretend your experiences.

I sure hope not!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they pick up on the energy strands that are intended to give life by sharing some awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IOBs will be partly under your command if you can get that kind of energy from a double being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I suppose, a male and a female having sex, if both are serious magic practitioners, would lend the male a steady supply of dark energy from the woman, while giving her more purpose and organizing ability, from the man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when it&amp;#39;s two men, I have no idea what happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only know, I tried to find old private class people to talk them into giving it a second chance, and found none willing to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I did discover many of them were &amp;quot;very&amp;quot; gay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone theorized, gay people were automatically against the shore in the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t feel as welcome out in the middle of the river, where the biggest shit slinging events take place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They tend to cling to the shore, which means they have a better chance to climb out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;True?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just worried about where Superman&amp;#39;s tongue is going next on the latest &amp;quot;woke&amp;quot; TV versions of old shows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Flash&amp;quot; was arrested in drag just last week, after invading someone&amp;#39;s home, and throwing a chair at a woman&amp;#39;s head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He got angry with the arresting policeman for using the wrong &amp;quot;pronoun&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Flash&amp;quot;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still like his show though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_v0y1hx", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/v0y1hx/the_enemies_of_a_sorcery_student/iaopgnn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1654018249.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iaokyh8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iao1xdi", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "Makes clear sense\nWomen need nagual man for motivation for what they can themselves do better.\nIf I may ask, What do you think about \nMen who identify as women \nAnd vice versa\nOr the double gender fans\nOr the ones that stopped using gender\nAltogether.

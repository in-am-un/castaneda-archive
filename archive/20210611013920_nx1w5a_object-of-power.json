attention power objects are more fun.\n\nMove your assemblage point until you see puffs, and then place as many on your torso as you can, focusing on the 3 \"pouches\" from that picture I made.\n\nDon't forget mashing energy and scooping all around.\n\nRemove the internal dialogue, until you can notice that you are still fantasizing in images.\n\nThe two of them (plus a 3rd you won't be able to find) constitute \"self-reflection\".\n\nPondering your idea of a self, created by your family.\n\nIt has to go, to move down below the red line.\n\nWhen the puffs in the air start to be filled with jet black between them, gather up a big ball of purple light. Or whatever color you have.\n\nMash it until it's \"real\", meaning, it stays on the hands and even stretches a bit when you separate them.\n\nUse the \"Pandora's Box\" pass to compress it.  Carlos wanted us to emphasize that.\n\nBy the way, if you follow that pass, you can indeed manifest a being.  I did it last night.\n\nNow the key point.  You need to find some yellow.\n\nLook around, typically it's at the boundary of the jet black and the purple, hiding behind the purple blobs.\n\nIf you can't find any yellow lean way back, look up as high as you can, stick both arms up there, and wave them around until you see the yellow.  Wave gently, you're just trying to add some energy there.\n\nWhen you find  yellow, forget it.  Can't use that yellow. I just wanted you to see the color.\n\nBut if you must, lean at an angle and see if you can't get it to \"drain\" down your arm, and onto the floor.\n\nIf you succeed and see yellow on the floor, bend over and use your hands to stir it around, like water.\n\nThen raise back up. The deeper you bend and the closer your hands get to the floor, with your knees mostly straight, the more you'll \"mix\" energy from below, to above.\n\nIf you manage to completely get rid of self-reflection, you will now be able to find yellow at torso level, hopefully behind the purple blobs so it is more \"real\".\n\nWARNING: You CANNOT have any internal dialogue, and you cannot be fantasizing about your worries, even if it's wordless. The images in your mind tug your assemblage point back to the top, and you need it to drop to the very bottom.\n\nGet that yellow into your left hand.  Don't compress it a lot, just get a basic blob shape on your hand.\n\nThen scoop around and add jet black to it. Just scoop the black up as if it were the purple, and dump it on the edges of the yellow.\n\nNext scoop a big purple blob into your right hand, and use it to make the yellow \"swirl\".  Circle it around the edges is one way.  If you see that the edges of the purple light on fire with intense blue, you will probably succeed.\n\nPower objects will form in the yellow.\n\nYou can extract things from the middle (\"Tensegrity Toys\") and set them on the bed.\n\nBut best is if the yellow condenses into an object all by itself.\n\nNow, find out what the power object does.\n\nRemote view aid is common.\n\nCan you keep the power object?\n\nThat's why I mentioned extracting toys.  They last on the bed, all by themselves, only as long as you pay attention to them.\n\nAnd you can't have any self-reflection in your mind.\n\nAfter 5 or 10 seconds of you not looking, they decompose.  All that's left is a pile of the jet black.\n\nThe ones in your hand will only grow in power, they don't dissolve.\n\nBut only as long as you can remain free from self-reflection, and only as long as you have energy.\n\nDon't look at the results too hard, or you'll burn off your energy.\n\nYou can call those objects back the next night by moving your assemblage point below the red line (which will take perfect silence again), and holding the hand you formed it in out, like you want a spirit to drop it there.\n\nI'd say 3 times will be the limit on calling it back for a beginner.\n\nTwo would be a great accomplishment.\n\nCongratulations: You are now more skilled than Yogananda.  Which doesn't say much, since he never managed to teach anyone.\n\nI have to add my grumpy lecture. It's become my trademark lately. I stepped on a lot of toes this week, telling the truth on Facebook.\n\nBeing interested in power objects is typically a sign of intense self-reflection in the form of pretend sorcery.\n\nYou're looking for something to make you a sorcerer without all the hard work.\n\nThat sort of thinking took down the entire crop of students Carlos had. All failed.\n\nPower objects need to be  an accidental find, while you are working your butt off to learn sorcery.\n\nFor instance, Pablito found the old seers power object by watching the whitish light on the ground, as he walked around where they used to have a city.\n\nHe had to be able to see the whitish light first, or he could not have found it. If you want to find the \"physical\" kind, that's the method.  It allows you to see \"intent disturbances\", even under the dirt.\n\nAnything that keeps you from learning to see that whitish light, for example believing you can find a power object and save work, will prevent you from making the decision to work hard and learn sorcery.\n\nDid you see the drug guy yesterday, who decided to get in a quick attack?\n\nAfter 2 back and forths, he accidentally revealed his \"thing\".\n\nHe believes he can take drugs to simulate the early books, and then to make himself feel better, he pretends to be stalking during the day.\n\nThat's another thing that took down the entire Castaneda community.\n\nBut it's the same principle. Find something you can fantasize about and pretend.\n\nI suppose that's better than hooking yourself to a fake teacher, to get the feeling of progress.\n\nBut the best way to learn is work, work, work.\n\nFor learning silence.", "edited": 1623423543.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h1eovj3", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second attention or first attention?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second attention power objects are more fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Move your assemblage point until you see puffs, and then place as many on your torso as you can, focusing on the 3 &amp;quot;pouches&amp;quot; from that picture I made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget mashing energy and scooping all around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remove the internal dialogue, until you can notice that you are still fantasizing in images.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two of them (plus a 3rd you won&amp;#39;t be able to find) constitute &amp;quot;self-reflection&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pondering your idea of a self, created by your family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has to go, to move down below the red line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the puffs in the air start to be filled with jet black between them, gather up a big ball of purple light.

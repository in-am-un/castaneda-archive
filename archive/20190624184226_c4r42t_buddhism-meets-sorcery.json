Hui Shen was not wrong there.\n\nThe book *El Rey Cosijoeza y Familia*, by Manuel Martinez Gracida, about one of the last Zapotec kings, has Guixepecocha, a supposed transliteration of Hui Shen Bhikkhu, teaching the Zapotecs Buddhist values as well as metallurgy and sculpture. It says as a result the Zapotec temples were never sullied with human blood, as per other parts of Mexico, and were wiser and better educated in sciences and arts than the m\u00e9xica: \"nunca ensangrentaron sus templos con sangre humana, y fueron m\u00e1s sabios \u00e9 instruidos en las ciencias y en las artes que los m\u00e9xica\". He then went to visit the Mixe, a Oaxacan tribe in the eastern mountains bordering the Isthmus, but was run out of town and disappeared over a cliff.

So they slap some glitter and weird ornaments on it, sing some disturbing local religious songs, play some drums, and tell everyone their technique has \"the truth\", and the others aren't worth your donations.\n\nMeanwhile, humans turn out to be flexible, like radios. They can tune into different stations.  I was a bit disappointed when Carlos first started to explain that in class, using the analogy of a beaded curtain.  We can get to any bead on our strand, and each one is a world to itself.  \n\nIt seemed hokey to me, until I learned to do it.\n\nWhile crossing worlds like that, we encounter other entities which can do the same.   Carlos called them, \u201cinorganic beings\u201d, and it\u2019s a good idea to keep in mind, sorcerers like to cut to the chase. Get to the point of it.  Not add flowery language and things to hide the truth.\n\nSo an \u201cinorganic being\u201d is any being you run into, which has no organic body (at least in this world).  It isn\u2019t something unattainable, and there aren\u2019t different kinds, with some being ones we want to ignore because they aren\u2019t \u201cofficial\u201d.  When you have nothing, get any inorganic being you can, even if you feel like dismissing it as a \u201chypnogogic image\u201d.  Whatever it is, it\u2019s useful for moving the assemblage point, which in the long run is the crux of our problem.\n\nI\u2019ve picked up a little one. Someone speculated she\u2019s a \u201clow energy\u201d inorganic.  I don\u2019t know about that, but last night was the third time she brought me to see her world. I\u2019m interested in going there, so I can try out that technique for moving objects merely by looking at them.\n\nHer presence doesn\u2019t preclude Carlos\u2019 2 allies, which he left to his private class. I\u2019m not sure how the sharing goes, but lately I don\u2019t get to see them as much.\n\nThe low energy one can form faces, small floating entities, horrible dead people imitations, military leaders, and just about anything you think about, in a subtle and almost unnoticeable way.  If you try to influence her more aggressively by suggesting a shape using language, there\u2019s a 10 minute to 2 day delay on actually getting it.  \n\nMost of the time, you have to settle for the shapes they\u2019ve been making in the last few days.\n\nCarlos\u2019 allies take on frightening shapes, maybe because they\u2019re always full sized, when they represent humans.  One came by last night, floating in a cloud of ultra-bright white, with him setting in the middle like he was in control of that environment, and had materialized it in front of me to let his presence be known.  He could have been sitting on a couch or a high-tech computer console. I couldn\u2019t tell because it was too alien.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not the first time it took that shape.  I seem to have talked Carlos\u2019 allies out of being random crazy men you\u2019d meet on the road (they used to love that shape), but now I have some kind of powerful alien shape.\n\nAnd someone could certainly interpret that manifestation as a genie.   In fact, if someone saw it, and that myth was already in their mind, that\u2019s surely what they\u2019d think.  And once they thought that, it would oblige even more.\n\nAnd then come the book deals. The death of knowledge!  People want to cash in, and start making up stuff.  If that guy saw a genie floating in a cloud (or maybe on a magic carpet), then the next guy saw 2 of them, and one was super horrible. \n\n The next guy saw the council of genies holding their annual meeting to decide if humans get to live or die.\n\nAll made up so that they can sell a few stories or manuscripts.  \n\nThe guys who messed things up might only have gotten the equivalent of a few hundred dollars.\n\nBut if you live somewhere poor, that\u2019s plenty.  I get offers even these days, to help someone with some small project or web page, and how much it could earn for them couldn\u2019t possibly amount to even a day\u2019s wages. But still, they\u2019re persistent.\n\nThat\u2019s where genies come from:   book deals.\n\nNo, I hadn't read that before.  I always like to get stuff like that, it's helpful for other people who want to learn.\n\nNow, just to be fair and less prejudiced.  There's a thing called, \"abstract dreaming\", where your assemblage point gets stuck at some position, where things are too different than here, to make any sense.  Usually you can't even translate it to our language, and convey what happened.\n\nFor instance, last night I got stuck in a stable position of the assemblage point for 5 full hours, perceiving exactly the same thing.  But I didn't realize that's what had happened. Instead, I thought that I'd had too many pages of techniques, and put one that consists of 5 yoga pillars into the wrong stack, which might cause confusion for people.\n\nSo I propped myself up on the bed on more cushions than usual, intent of trying out that \"yoga pillar\" technique, to see how much damage it would cause if it got out\n\nFor 5 hours.\n\nMoral of the story:  Meaning is only a position of the assemblage point.  So who are any of us to say, there really aren't any genies?\n\nEdited: once", "edited": 1564952023.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_evz7u9g", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate to be too prejudiced.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok...

She&amp;#39;s a mess of very bright jagged lines, about 3 inches in diameter, containing at least one blue line, and one red line.  All very bright and unique looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The activity of the lines moving (spinning slowly), generates the image.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if she&amp;#39;s not one of  Carlos&amp;#39; allies, that&amp;#39;s good news for all of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grab yourself a hypnogogic image from the second attention mist, and play with it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you want to try to find an inorganic being in its original form before you make it into something else, go look up star trek episode &amp;quot;Day of the Dove&amp;quot;, where the Klingons and the crew were set up to battle forever, with a weird entity floating above them.  Reduce that to about 3 inches, remove the puffs of light and replace them with sparse bright lines, and that&amp;#39;s sort of what this one looks like, when it isn&amp;#39;t pretending to be something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_c4r42t", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/c4r42t/buddhism_meets_sorcery/ery4fot/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1561400182.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1561400182.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ery3ecf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1561399512.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_erxz7nb", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;I was trying to convert my Fairy into a Cat, so that I could teach it to chase the second attention rodents\n\nWhat a \"sight\" that will be!

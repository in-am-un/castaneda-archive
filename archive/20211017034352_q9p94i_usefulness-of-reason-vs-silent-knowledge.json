But it only lasted a few seconds, and only happened because I looked for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that&amp;#39;s how you get past that barrier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; was so surprising, I&amp;#39;m a little reluctant to comment about it here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if anyone wants to read this potential damaging knowledge, make the following pledge:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will not skip ahead. I don&amp;#39;t need attention that badly.   I must pass all road signs to make sure I&amp;#39;m on the right path.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not trying to learn things. I&amp;#39;m trying to lure intent to pull me along. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if I&amp;#39;m pleased.  The one who needs to be pleased with my efforts, is The Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do not care about my experiences being more interesting than someone else.  All I care about is sticking to the trail of the old seers intent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So then, here it is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double shows up in the dark room constantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our mistake is not to realize, anytime you are sitting here and you catch a glimpse of &amp;quot;there&amp;quot;, that&amp;#39;s the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any dream is the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t go so far as to say any &lt;strong&gt;vision&lt;/strong&gt; is the double, or that only the double can perceive floating dreams in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if you have trouble &amp;quot;blanking out&amp;quot; while forcing silence, but you&amp;#39;ve noticed there&amp;#39;s a tiny little dream you barely remember when you get back from being blanked out, that&amp;#39;s the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, you can &amp;quot;look&amp;quot; for him, and get a tiny flash that seems like a memory of a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All we&amp;#39;re trying to do is lure him to &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; copy of reality.  Bring him into our &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally he doesn&amp;#39;t care. He&amp;#39;ll wander around anywhere.  Phantom realm, or real place that has its own energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose he got disgusted with us, and didn&amp;#39;t want to stick around too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you start learning to be silent, you aren&amp;#39;t as off putting as before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His thinking is like the ancient Olmecs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything you can perceive is real. They didn&amp;#39;t  judge things, they just used them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Judging &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; versus &amp;quot;imaginary&amp;quot; is a product of an imaginary distinction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;self&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But our &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; is an imaginary construct, designed for interfacing with other crazy people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With no concept of &amp;quot;self&amp;quot;, you just accept what you perceive as something you can work with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/q9p94i/usefulness_of_reason_vs_silent_knowledge/hgzqcke/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1634483581.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_q9p94i", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hgyadf6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "lurklops", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hgxyfkt", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4dmerkxi", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Great post.

[{"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": 1, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "castaneda", "selftext": "You can find the post on my previous \"IOB-induced dreaming experience\" here:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/1854ml8/generous\\_intent\\_gift\\_or\u2026](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/1854ml8/generous_intent_gift_or_something_deeper/)\n\nOn the 25/03/2024, at around 04:30 at night, I had another, intense experience, which is why I decided to write this report.  \nFurther, this gives me the chance to clarify various details about the approach I have been following.  \nBefore that, I had a handful of other experiences, however, in terms of the \"intensity\" experienced, the one from the 25/03/2024 stands out.\n\nFirstly, I should emphasize that the approach I have been applying most likely **still should be looked at as \"dark room practice\"** rather than the \"4 (or 7) gates of dreaming\". I agree that (while my previous experience definitely incorporated some aspects of the 4 gates of dreaming), the critical factor here really is the IOB. The IOB enables me to \"get there\", most likely by some kind of energy exchange.  \nHence, a more accurate expression for this individualized dark room technique would probably an \"IOB-induced dreaming experience\" (IIDE) or something like that.\u00a0  \nYes, the \"4 gates of dreaming\" is a very specific and rather DIFFICULT technique, most likely only chosen by few. So I should try to be as precise as I can about these things.\n\n*Note:*  \n*I have practiced the 5 main techniques for a while, but for some reason, this \"IIDE\" approach seems to work for me best, which is something I found out by trial-and-error. In a nutshell, this is some kind of \"customized\" dark room practice, showing that sometimes you have to slightly adjust a technique to make it work for you specifically (which is also why I am doing this post). Sorcery is more art than science I guess.*\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  \n1.  \n**In order for the IIDE to work, I NEED at least the ATTENTION of an IOB, and, secondly, that IOB needs to see my INTENT.**  \nThese seem to be the only main conditions.  \nFor a while I assumed that I need to violently \"grab\" any IOBs / orbs in order to \"get there\", however, after having gained more experience, this is not necessary. As stated, all which is needed is the IOB's attention and then the authentic display of my intent. Then things start to happen.\n\n2.  \nNext, I realized that it is beneficial if I wake up between **03:30 and 05:00** before starting. I do not know why, but in this time window (at least where I live), there is just a special energy which makes the IIDE easier (at least for me).\n\n3.\u00a0  \nFor some reason, in my personal case, I need to lay down, I cannot do it in a seated position. That seems to be an individual limitation. I am sure that some can do all that sitting or even standing.\n\n4.  \nThe \"bed tensegrity moves\" (check this forum), such as 'circling the feet' can be beneficial. I often do these for a while at the beginning.  \nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nI would like to add that it would be WAY to overwhelming to have these experience every single night, but maybe that changes over time.\n\nAlso, I should note that the \"win/loss\" ratio of this approach is rather low; for **one experience to take place, there can be easily around 10 failed attempts**. A \"failed\" attempt normally leads to falling asleep and waking up the next day, as usual.\n\n*Special note: The significance of dark room practice*\n\n*I feel that this realization could possibly be of value for others; namely, while CC only mentions dark room practices a few times in the books, there is no question in my mind that this lineage here / the forum kind of represents the \"last book\" of CC (not to say the \"missing piece\"!); I think I finally understood that the dark room approach is WAY easier than the 4 gates of dreaming and that it can \"get us there\" by finding inner silence and then by conducting IOB-interaction.*\n\n*I could imagine that CC, given that he would have lived longer, may have even written a book only on dark room practice, however, it also seems likely that each lineage has its own \"focus\". In the \"visual\" world of today, it kind of makes sense to use that \"waking dream\" approach, this by finding the emanations of the energy body etc. Note that things such as the internet, forums, AI, animation software etc. are rather new phenomena.*  \n*A further discussion of this topic is probably \"beyond my current pay grade\", so I stop here.*\n\n------------------------------------------------------------  \n**The experience**\n\nOn the 25/03/2024 at around 04:30 at night, I woke up.  \nI put on my goggles, laid down and switched off my thinking. At some point, I finally reached silence and the first colorful puffs appeared. After around 20 minutes or so, I could see a face...\n\nI then realized, that I (again) entered \"another place\". This time, the environment looked like some kind of Hawaiian setting, but at the same time it did not resemble any place on our earth. I was standing inside a huge complex, along with (probably) a few hundred other \"beings\". Like in my other experience, these beings did look humanoid, but at the same time they did not give the impression that they were from Earth. Their faces had several colors, a bit difficult to describe.  \nBut also, by looking at any of these beings, one could instantly \"see\" their name, identity and even whole life story. A little difficult to explain.  \nAt some point I realized that all of us were participating in some kind of \"guided tour\". The tour covered 5 different parts of the huge complex, whereby the \"guide\" was explaining one particular \"task\" for each of these 5 parts / wings.\n\nI wish I could remember more details of these \"tasks\" (content-wise), unfortunately, despite my efforts, I was not able to bring back much of that content. All I know is that the \"tasks\" seemed very demanding, complex and required different types of skills (qualitative, quantitative etc.). I remember that I concluded that the completion of just one of these tasks would take me weeks. I tried to take notes of all the details the guide gave us, unfortunately, I was not able to bring these notes back to here.\n\nLike in the last experience, the \"vibe\" overall was very positive. Again, there is no doubt in my mind that these beings were \"dreamers\" from another place, all meeting there to experience dreaming together.  \nThe whole experience lasted around 7h. During that time, I walked quite a distance through that complex and also had a lot of interactions.  \nAgain, this experience is NOT like a \"lucid dream\" or anything like that. Everything was in HD, every little detail was as if I was physically walking there right now. I was in control. I could decide what to do next, what to say next, with whom to interact etc. Also, everything is \"realer than real\", it is not easy to describe that with language.\u00a0  \nAgain, there is no doubt in my mind that these are \"dreamers\" from different places, coming together to \"dream together\". I know that sounds science-fiction-like, but it is not.\n\nBut here is the issue. After around 7h (when in this world the sun started to rise), I felt that I was slipping away, and soon woke up, back in this world.  \nHowever, the actual \"tasks\" had not even started for me!  \nI kind of \"left early\", because of the fact that I (had to) wake up.\n\nI come to this conclusion (please feel free to express your own opinions / experiences).  \n**We human dreamers are kind of \"restricted\" by the fact that we sleep between 6 to 10h and then wake up back in the matrix.**\u00a0  \n**This restrictions does not exist for these other beings.**\n\nI am sure that they stayed, continued, and worked on these \"tasks\".  \nThat could be why we as beings with \"limited stamina\" are bound to \"come back early\" and hence our exposure is often limited.  \nNow, I know that time can be bent in these other realms, however, in this particular experience, there seemed to be little I could do to stay and complete my assigned tasks.  \n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs such, I guess I get glimpses, and do not get me wrong, I am VERY GRATEFUL for these! This is beyond anything I could ever have imagined!!!!  \nHowever, I wonder in which ways I could approach these IIDEs that would enable me to \"stay\" just a little longer.  \nOr, do we simply need to accept the limitations we have as humans from Earth?\n\nAnyways.  \nI may do another update with regard to this path that has somehow chosen me. It is fascinating, mind-boggling, inspiring. However, to be honest, I just wonder:  \n**a) Will I ever be able to \"bring more content back\" from these experiences? Or is it supposed to stay this way?**  \n**Would it be wrong trying to \"bring back\" some of that knowledge shown? Is there some kind of \"filter\"?**  \n**Does anyone have thoughts / experiences on that?**  \n**b) Will the \"human restrictions\" (such as the need to fall sleep and wake up) limit our abilities in these other realms? If yes, are these realms aware of that? Is there a way to extend the time?**  \n**Maybe by looking for another scout within the dream? Or another idea, by actually practicing dark room within that experience, trying to again reach a \"dream within a dream\"?**  \n**c) What will be the bottom line of all that?**  \n**Do not get me wrong, the interactions and experiences are AMAZINGLY beautiful and it literally feels like an additional plain of existence (and even that feels like an understatement).**  \n**However, there DOES seem to be a lot of \"MEANING\" in these experiences, but I would lie if I would say that I can easily decipher all of that meaning. Again, any comments, thoughts, hints, tips would be appreciated.**\n\nThank you for your time and energy,  \nFF\n\n  \nEDITED 21:20 (spelling)", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Another \"IOB-induced\" 'dreaming experience' (IIDE)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Misc.

And the instructions are in here!\n\n\\*\\*\\* From Silent Knowledge Publication \\*\\*\\*\n\nThe end result of those sorcerers' new endeavors was the art of dreaming as it stands today. Through discipline, they succeeded in developing their dreaming attention to an extraordinary degree. They were able to focus it on any element of their dreams, and found out, in this fashion, that there were two kinds of dreams. One was the dreams that we are all familiar with, in which phantasmagorical elements come into play, something which we could categorize as the product of our mentality, our psyche; perhaps something that has to do with our neurological makeup. The other kind of dreams, they called energy-generating dreams. Don Juan said that those sorcerers of ancient times found themselves in dreams that were not dreams, but actual visitations made in a dream-like state to bona fide places other than this world - real places, just like the world in which we live: places where the objects of the dream generated energy, just like trees, or animals, or even rocks generate energy in our dally world.\n\nTheir visions of such places, were, however, too fleeting, too temporary, to be of any value to them. They attributed this flaw to the fact that their assemblage points could not be held, for any considerable time, fixed at the position to which they had been displaced. Their attempts to remedy the situation resulted in the other high art of sorcery: the art of stalking, or the feat of holding the assemblage point fixed at the position to which it had been displaced. This fixation allowed them the opportunity to witness that world in its full extent. Don Juan said that some of those sorcerers never returned from their journeys. In other words, they opted for staying there, wherever \"there\" was.\n\nDon Juan said that in mapping human beings as luminous spheres, those sorcerers at ancient times discovered six hundred spots in the total luminous sphere which give, as a result, if the assemblage point happened to be fixed at any of them, the entrance into a total new world. His answer to my unavoidable question, \"But where are those worlds\" was \"in the position of the assemblage point.\" Nothing could be truer than that statement, and yet, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever to us.\n\nHowever, if it is examined in the light of the sorcerers' capacity to see energy as it flows in the universe, it makes sense for them. Their position is that the assemblage point at its habitual location receives an inflow of energy fields from the universe at large in the form of luminous energy filaments. Consistently, the same filaments, numbering in the billions, go through the assemblage point, giving as a result the world that we know. If the assemblage point is displaced to another position, another set of energy filaments goes through. Sorcerers feel that this new set of energy filaments cannot possibly give a view of the same world; that by definition that world has to be different from the world of everyday life. Since the assemblage point is not only the center where perception is assembled, but the center where interpretation of sensory data is accomplished, sorcerers feel that it will interpret the new influx of energy fields in very much the same terms in which it interprets the world of everyday life. The result of this new interpretation is the view of a world which is strangely similar to ours, and yet intrinsically different. Don Juan said that it is only the interpretation of the assemblage point which accounts for the sense of similarity, and that energetically, other worlds are as different from ours as they could possibly be.\n\nIn order to express this wondrous quality of the assemblage point and the possibilities of perception brought about by dreaming, a new syntax is needed; or perhaps the same syntax of our language could cover it if this experience made available to any one of us, and not merely to shaman initiates.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHere's a tip:  The way you tell those worlds are \"energy generating\" is found in the mid orange zone of the J curve map.\n\nYou'll first notice it as lines or wavy patterns on the walls of your dark room.\n\nCarlos said you see a \"whitish light on surfaces\".\n\nWhich means, YOU CAN SEE THE ROOM IN ABSOLUTE DARKNESS!\n\nNow keep in mind, before you get to that point you're just as likely to see that you are now practicing inside a reddish brown cave.\n\nThat's DEEP red zone.  To get to the orange zone, the assemblage point has to move under, and then back up in the front.\n\nIt starts to bleach out to white, somewhere just below your belly button.\n\nAs it continues up, perhaps in line with the belly button, the reddish sights have completely bleach out and  you see the whitish light.\n\nThen the whitish light takes on textures. I see vertical lines.\n\nIt's \"seeing energy\".\n\nDon't get too excited when you realize you can now see in the dark.\n\nOtherwise you'll have to chastise yourself later when you realize the \"room\" you see, had walls in the wrong places.\n\nOr it begins to form even more detail, and you have a painting of a cow pasture hanging on the wall.\n\nDon't fret!  It's even better than seeing in the dark!\n\nIt's a \"phantom room\".\n\nIt's a long story, but you keep exploring that, until you see whitish light moving closer to your eyes, like a wall or viewing screen.\n\nYou notice, there's little movies playing on that!  Full color too.\n\nIf you can contain yourself, you just ignore what's on TV to keep forcing the same silence that got you there.\n\nBy then, silence will be \"a thing\" and not just a concept.\n\nBy the way, we don't mean not talking silence!\n\nThat's a monk indulgence, and leads to an even worse \"internal dialogue\".\n\nWe mean, you actually have to get rid of that voice in your head.\n\nAnd to get to the \"Phantom Room\" and \"Viewing Screen\", you already know full well what it takes to get silent.\n\nSo you just sit on pillows on the bed, and CONCENTRATE only on gaining more of that silence.\n\nThe whitish light starts to dominate everything, and vision after vision is offered to you.\n\nNow you have, \"the tool\".\n\nIf you could just switch to a dream, you'd find that the whitish light is still there.\n\nEven if the dream is a dream of a beautiful park in the sunlight.\n\nWhich is so odd. You can't miss it.\n\nYou're used to the whitish light vanishing instantly if you turn on the lights, as if it were actually albino tiny cockroaches, now fleeing the kitchen because the lights turned on.\n\nIn dreaming, it's still there.\n\nTHAT'S how you tell if the dream is entirely phantom, or contains \"real\" beings.\n\nOr is itself, a real world.\n\nWith that tool.  The \"Whitish Light Tool\".\n\nI suppose you could bring the Buddha's 4  hookers and make them lick everything, to see if it's real.\n\nBut that would take more cash than even the Buddha had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Why 600 Cyclic Beings?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"2afexppu6um81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 129, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2afexppu6um81.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=173d992ce06d9653802eec062af05c560aba6b12"}, {"y": 258, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2afexppu6um81.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29ecd6e9e7b7726d829b8ccbc12cb27e021ca746"}, {"y": 382, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2afexppu6um81.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34d51fa623d09f5f34a391a08b96ff691ed5d5c4"}], "s": {"y": 718, "x": 600, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2afexppu6um81.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c2318f005d45df9f452d7b11926ff4e7bcff675"}, "id": "2afexppu6um81"}}, "name": "t3_tc2qte", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 15, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 15, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/qoeKpgDJiwz33LHin_Ap_fQz5mcEPMtYiefGmmO3EN0.jpg", "edited": 1647125096.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1647040219.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2afexppu6um81.png?width=600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6c2318f005d45df9f452d7b11926ff4e7bcff675\"&gt;Those Ain&amp;#39;t \\&amp;quot;Dancing Girls!\\&amp;quot;  Go to Asia and find out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up thinking I ought to read &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot; (despite the ban from Carlos) and found so much in it I&amp;#39;m surprised people have the opinion on things they do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an odd coincidence.

The &amp;quot;Whitish Light Tool&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could bring the Buddha&amp;#39;s 4  hookers and make them lick everything, to see if it&amp;#39;s real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that would take more cash than even the Buddha had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "tc2qte", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 18, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/tc2qte/why_600_cyclic_beings/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/tc2qte/why_600_cyclic_beings/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1647040219.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i0dxlaj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i0d7f2v", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Yes, there is a spanish version, but the names are different!\n\nCan you believe the \"Silent Knowledge\" publication is called \"El Silencio Interno\"?

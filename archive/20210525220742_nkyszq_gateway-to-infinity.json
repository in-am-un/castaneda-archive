I don't know, but this works!](https://preview.redd.it/zxobymcmpb171.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82ae906acaa6b973b7fbca56e31f1824eefc4d76)\n\nSometimes you'll read something, and then your inorganic being will \"teach\" it to you.\n\nYou have to worry then, is it like their appearance?\n\nFor instance, if someone says their IOB is a clown (sorry Cholita), and then a new person sees a clown that night, is it just the power of suggestion?\n\n\"Stray Intent\"?\n\nAnd, there's nothing going on at all which is \"real\"?\n\nFirst, get that idea out of your head.\n\nNo one can force themselves to see anything they like!  There's simply no technique like that.\n\nIf there were, people wouldn't get so excited over Daniel Ingrams \"chi balls\", or Shinzen's little drummer man on his  hand.\n\nFrankly, the whole idea that we could do that defies our own experiences!\n\nIf mankind could do that, we'd all stay home in our room and materialize interesting, \"things\".\n\nYou know the ones...  Do I have to say it?\n\nAnd the meditation forums wouldn't be so horribly disappointing.\n\nWe wouldn't get lynched when we go out and try to lure new people with promises of this type of magic.\n\nThey'd all say, \"Anyone can do that!\"\n\nBut instead, they lynch you while accusing you of being a deceiver.\n\nAnd the witchcraft forums would actually be entertaining if people could see whatever they like.\n\nBut we can't.\n\nIf we could, we'd all know it.\n\nThere's something else going on with the \"Clown effect\".\n\nWhat exactly, we don't know.\n\nIOBs have no organic being, so they tune in to your expectations.\n\nIf you are very very good at silencing the mind, you can watch it happen.\n\nHow your ideas \"bounce\" off of them, while they are just a glow in the air.\n\nLittle pieces of what you expect spin off, and come back at you.\n\nThen intent fills in the missing details.\n\nSo Lily taught me a technique I read about just in the last 2 days, not because she doesn't exist and it was all in my head, but because my curiosity about how Elias could do that, was there.\n\nIt's no different than if I was frightened of IOBs, and they materialized as demons.\n\nI'm not, so they materialize as whatever is best, to interact with me.\n\nIn this case, Lily could teach me what I was thinking about.\n\nSo she did.\n\nBut this morning I realized, Fairy had taught me that technique also.\n\nYou just don't realize it at the time, because it \"evolves\" over an hour or so, and all you think is that it was a series of random \"cool things\". You're more worried about keeping track, than putting them together into a single \"story\".\n\nWhat can you do with this picture?\n\nProbably not the technique itself, but if you realize that there are 3 levels to the internal dialogue which you can control, shown in this picture, you might gain some advantage in the dark room.\n\nOn the other hand, if you succeed at traveling millions of light years into the universe, the way I did last night, could you please keep an eye out for my house keys?\n\nThey're missing, and I'm trying to retrace all the places I visited yesterday.\n\nUsually it's Cholita who loses house keys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded":

I landed on the ground in a moderate sized city, w here everything was spaced much further apart than cities here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t a &amp;quot;practical&amp;quot; way to make a city, at least not from our point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I realized the technique had worked, and instead of only viewing other worlds I had actually traveled there, I bounced back to my body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This technique is repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lily was waiting for me, and I had a sudden insight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan taught Carlos about how to proceed in the dark room, even if it&amp;#39;s not obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His instruction consisted of one dramatic even after another, without trying to do the previous one again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I vaguely recall there were a couple he did more than once, but for the most part, once he saw some dazzling magic, we didn&amp;#39;t hear about it again because something else replaced that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how it goes in the dark room at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t duplicate things you learn more than once or twice, and then you find something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the second time is not nearly as vivid as the first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to keep moving.  It&amp;#39;s a long distance. But if you choose, you can indeed go back again. You just can&amp;#39;t insist on it.

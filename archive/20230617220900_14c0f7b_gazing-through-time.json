Or as Carlos preferred, and it does seem slightly more accurate, \"Out of syntax\".\n\nStrangely, of those two statements mine is the optimistic one.\n\nI believe you simply can't find those hints of alternate reality pieces because you don't know which direction to gaze.  So it's like turning your head when you're walking in a lush jungle, a bit worried you'll get lost.  And your head scans past the most amazing beetle you have ever seen.\n\nI've heard that \"Pok\u00e9mon\" was invented by an autistic Japanese kid who liked beetles. Probably kept the poor creatures locked up in those plastic balls that hold cheap toys in vending machines for school kids.  Let's just hope he didn't hurl them at his enemies in school, pretending the beetle would burst out and defend him against oppressors.\n\nWhich are many in Japanese schools.\n\nSo imagine you're about to catch your first glimpse, but you don't even look on the surface of the leaves. It's just one of far too many jungle details to pay attention to.\n\nThat's my idea on why people can't do what's in this picture, automatically. They're lured by the easy to understand view of ancient ruins, but can't look for what's behind those.  What triggered that phantom creation (dream).\n\nBut Carlos had the gloomy view.  His idea is that they're staring right at the beetle, but it doesn't fit with their internal dialogue's view of the world.\n\nSo it has to not exist.\n\nLet's take my point of view and analyze it.  In that point of view, you just have to notice it.  You won't reject it.  But you DO have to find it.\n\nRule #1 of darkroom states, if you gaze in silence at anything that \"can't possibly be there\", the assemblage point moves down along the J curve, to seek out the level  from where it might originate.\n\nBut rule #2 is more relevant here.\n\nIf you treat anything that \"can't possibly be there\" as real, the assemblage point moves horizontally, to make it more so.\n\nSo #1 locates the object, perhaps down a dark spooky forest trail.  In the distance, you see the shine of jelly beans.  But it's a dark spooky forest!  There's no jelly bean trees!  So you walk down the road to get closer (assemblage point moves down).\n\n\\#2 is where you pick it up in your hands.  It's a gingerbread house!  100% edible.\n\nShit, now you did it.\n\nYou treated it as real.  So out comes the nasty old witch who lives there.  Of course, she's just your Ally playing along.\n\nIn the modern Disney version, I've heard she's actually quite busty.\n\nSo the level of \"horror\" in this scenario is all up to your own dubious personality.\n\nDon't blame the allies.\n\nBut how or what, can you \"treat as real\"?\n\nLet's take those annoying blue dots. The \"career makers\" of the Yogi world.\n\nI see them as pests.  Flies buzzing around, smelling up your magic.\n\nBut for the sake of argument, how can we find out what those darned things are?\n\nYou'd have to come up with a way to \"treat them as real\" so that your assemblage point could move sideways, and make them so.\n\nThen you could experiment on them.  Maybe trap some in a mason jar, like fireflies.\n\nSo here's the point of this picture.\n\nWhat do we treat as real?\n\nCarlos thought, only that which your syntax can handle.\n\nMy thinking is, only that which you notice.\n\nAnd our problem is that we've only noticed what we've been told to notice, since after we first we went to junior high.\n\nBefore than, especially when we were infants, we noticed everything.\n\nEven that which was completely irrational.\n\nLike some faint signal light on a hill so far away it's just a black silhouette.  But you can almost make out a tiny purple splotch.  Not even a shape that makes any sense. It's as if someone took a whole roll of aluminum foil, and wrapped it around something very large, shiny side out.\n\nAnd you're catching bare flickers of star light, along the foil at a great distance.\n\nIt's not a meaningful sight. No edges, no shapes, no actual border.\n\nEspecially since, to the left a bit further on is a Burger King.\n\nAnd to the right still near enough to be visible, is the shopping mall lit up at night.\n\nTo notice the foil in the middle, you have to stop being \"you\".  Don't want what \"you\" normally wants, don't look only where \"poor me\" needs to look, to seek attention and praise from others.\n\nEspecially during darkroom.\n\nSo in this picture's scenario, you're staring right into the face of astonishing magic!\n\nA dream floating in the air.  Into which you might enter, send your ally in as a scout, or  merely reach in with your hand and pull out a magical object.\n\nBut you've already lost if you do those things.\n\nThe book deal mind wiped out the most important query.\n\nWhy is that dream located at that specific spot?\n\nWorse, if you think such a thing you're even more lost. If you stop to think about, what to do, to be more \"great\".\n\nShun the peasant stuff like vision questing!  Go for seeing the essence of all things.\n\nThat thought will also kill this.\n\nYou simply have to be so empty (silent), that you stop rejecting, influencing,  or selecting things.\n\nThen you get to see \"what's really there\".\n\nExcept that it's not.\n\nYou've just got \"Yoda Vision\" now.\n\nYou can look anywhere in space and time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Gazing Through Time", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Practical Magic"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"mgt8q7luxm6b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mgt8q7luxm6b1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=096da057c149b36c42a57715a9b3114edc92c5ad"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mgt8q7luxm6b1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bbdd2938f8e7a52e58d076d798ed47d6101d6c1"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mgt8q7luxm6b1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a63aa52d5be513a6b924869992f32f088c4b67dd"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mgt8q7luxm6b1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b2668921cebca6b142305a123fd470fc503142f"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mgt8q7luxm6b1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2664ec0d23ca83f13cb4bab6cc03b81d75b24df"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mgt8q7luxm6b1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=758a593b4695dc2584c68aecf951c1fcc843ce76"}], "s": {"y": 3072, "x": 3072, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mgt8q7luxm6b1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3ab57046e5dd626464e248fe92eb79427b4b7cb"}, "id": "mgt8q7luxm6b1"}}, "name": "t3_14c0f7b", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Practical Magic", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ST0bCwqsP0xB8xl_KDaT4Aqg7J-V4eJB4QMwxEAI3as.jpg", "edited": 1687054213.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1687032540.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mgt8q7luxm6b1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c3ab57046e5dd626464e248fe92eb79427b4b7cb\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/mgt8q7luxm6b1.jpg?width=3072&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c3ab57046e5dd626464e248fe92eb79427b4b7cb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The picture is self-explanatory, including a warning to beginners not to try to pretend this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way our entire community took &amp;quot;Art of Dreaming&amp;quot;, and sloppily pretended that it had anything at all to do with &amp;quot;lucid dreaming&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then they went a step further in laziness, and pretended lucid dreaming had anything to do with ordinary dreams, which you can remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so, the very precise instructions in Art of Dreaming got turned into an attention seeking device based on telling other people your weird dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And specifically because people equate pretending with the real thing, there&amp;#39;s stuff over in the advanced subreddit that can&amp;#39;t go in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This belonged over there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because if we had 10 in our entire community who could even understand this post, I&amp;#39;d be very pleased.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to look at it and think you understand, but there&amp;#39;s that warning on the lower right of the picture about how the missing part of that process between the last 2 scenes on the right, can&amp;#39;t possibly be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d have to be able to extrapolate &amp;quot;blanking out&amp;quot;

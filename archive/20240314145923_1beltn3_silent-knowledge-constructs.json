If we got a LOT more energetic mass, maybe we could create teams of &amp;quot;Historian Seers&amp;quot; and correct all the falsehoods about how various spiritual practices and religions got started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you had the actual details of how Christianity was started, you&amp;#39;d likely see that Jesus was a na\u00efve religious zealot trying to spread early Jewish magic for everyone to practice, but when he was killed for criticizing the money changers,  the apostles changed what he was teaching, into what people believe it to be today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they liked leading his &amp;quot;movement&amp;quot;, the same way Cleargreen has corrupted what Carlos taught us.  They&amp;#39;ve nearly finished elevating Carlos to godlike status so that he&amp;#39;s suitable for a new religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bet you&amp;#39;d get some very ugly details on Islam and it&amp;#39;s true origins abusing people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And prove the Buddha was just as crappy as all the neighborhood Yogis living in his time were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe figure out precisely how Lao Tzu got invented by bad Chinese men hoping to steal from the emperor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very possible to do that.   You could even uncover some archaeology locations to go with the facts you bring back, so that people came to realize you really did  go back in time to view the event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could shatter known history and remove some of the flier&amp;#39;s manufactured blinders on humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_1beltn3", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/1beltn3/silent_knowledge_constructs/kuzgmfw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1710507562.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kuzf70z", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1710506942.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1beltn3", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "We had a post, made yesterday that was a perfect (\ud83d\ude09) response from a bad player to this:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/1beuf2l/opinion_why_i_personally_believe_zen_is_superior/ - (all our comments)\n\nIt got 148 comments in a matter of hours, before the user who posted it deleted it and all their comments.

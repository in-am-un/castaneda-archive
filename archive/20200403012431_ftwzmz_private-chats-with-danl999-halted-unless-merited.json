And then of course, you want them to learn the theories and rules.  So that they feel they are living in a new home, and understand what's required.  You want them to feel, they can find a place to fit in there.\n\nAnd as the male leader does magical things, one of the women will pop in and do that even more than he could.\n\nThey can just do that.  \n\nIf the new Nagual had 8 men first, they'd all be dead in a few months from ego attacks. \n\nOr they'd turn into a group masturbation party and never get any further.\n\nNot to mention, with 8 hot women maybe you can get the men to stay and behave.\n\nDidn't work for Carlos. But there was money making in the way.  And maybe he just didn't get enough time.\n\n&gt; If I don't focus my attention on the world, the world collapses\n\nIt really, really does.  I did that last night several times, trying to switch my eyes into the mode for seeing energy.\n\nAt one point, it collapsed from me not focusing attention on it, specifically because I was halfway to focusing on energy only.  \n\nLet me explain that. Normally, to remove your focus and get the world to collapse, you have to work very hard to get the last traces of images from the mind.\n\nIn this case, your attention is zapped onto something else, not of this world. And it's so compelling, it's like a magnet.\n\nIn other words, if you can learn to do that, then stopping the world becomes easy and instant.  \n\nAnd it's just a feeling of glancing down and to the right.  But it has to be just the right direction, which I guess means just because you did it once, doesn't mean you can do it twice. \n\nI succeed partially last night.  After asking my inorganic being to help me again.  She knows which direction to look.\n\nI ended up standing on some strange yellow glowing surface, and could only see the lower half of my body. It was just a cloud of yellow/white.\n\nAnd then of course, the book deal mind got the best of me.  I was thinking of how to explain what you do, to switch the eyes into seeing energy. \n\nI thought maybe I could tip you guys off and save you some time.\n\nBut instead of returning to my actual bedroom, as a result of letting my internal dialogue resume, I was in an alien \"bamboo\" forest.\n\nMy bed, which I could only feel under my butt, was smack dab in the middle of thick stemmed plants.  \n\nEverywhere. \n\nI was afraid to even take a step into it, knowing how bad bamboo forests can be on Mt. Ali in Taiwan. It's wet down there, and the shoots can pierce your foot.\n\nI said, out loud, \"Where the hell am I?\"  \n\nMy little fairy entity had been hanging around, even though she's still flat from Cholita. I was hoping she'd come clear up the situation.\n\nAnd then I was back in my bedroom.  I guess she did.\n\n&gt; or by gazing at the clouds.\n\nMore proof the witches are the real thing!\n\nWe always kind of need that, because of how women fit into sorcery groups.  It's as I said earlier, they just need to be around, and they'll find cool magic to do on their own.  So if you go back in time and look at old pictures of Carlos with women, it seems very much like they were mostly just hanging out.\n\nAnd that's good.  That is in fact how it works.\n\nBut Cholita doesn't have the same regard for all of the witches.  I won't say why, but she claims some are more powerful than the others, and the ones that aren't powerful aren't worth listening to.\n\nI disagree.  \n\nAnd I guarantee Cholita would have some critics if she were in their position.\n\nBack to the \"proof\".  One of the witches taught the women in private class to gaze at the sky.  I was always curious why she didn't teach men.\n\nIt's because women need gazing.  They're already able to go far into the second attention, because of what you quoted.\n\nThe men need to put their forehead on a stick, or make their fingers bleed, to learn silence.\n\nGazing doesn't get men all that far, other than to prove to them that the second attention is accessible.\n\nThe gazing, with men, takes them where it does, and it ends there.\n\nWith women, I supposed they can take it from there.  \n\nBut they need to learn where the gas pedal is located.\n\nThey need to learn to push the accelerator on demand, instead of only doing it while they're laying in bed with cramps.\n\n&gt;Sometimes we used to sit there for days until the crack would open.\n\nSo, being the best hope for Carlos' teachings, I hope the eastern bloc is listening.\n\nIt's not a hobby. It's not a little side business. It's not something to tickle your fancy, because you can talk to yourself all day long about how much progress your making, and how many friends you have who are also on the \"path with heart\", how much inventory you've collected from Carlos fans and gossip.\n\nYou have to actually do very hard work or you get nowhere, very very slowly.  \n\nI believe Wayne corrected the story of the Buddha reaching enlightenment just because he decided to, sitting at that tree for a week.\n\nAt least that's the way I always heard it. I was worried where he got lunch.\n\nBut it was only a day. \n\nAnd he had practice before that.\n\nBut I still like the idea.  Just plop yourself down, shut up, and learn to get silent and summon the second attention.  Gaze if you have to.\n\nBut stop all the talking and talking, if you want the real thing.\n\n&gt; It was rather the capacity to change levels of attention.\n\nI would dare to say, you aren't even on the path until you can do at least a little of that, for real.\n\nIf anyone's reading this and thinking you just can't put in the time needed, you might be right.\n\nCarlos saw to it that I continued to have plenty of time, by making me celibate.\n\nBut if you don't have the time, then cheat.  Use a simple form of mantric meditation.  Just repeat, \"Aing... Aing...\" over and over.

And then of course, you want them to learn the theories and rules.  So that they feel they are living in a new home, and understand what&amp;#39;s required.  You want them to feel, they can find a place to fit in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as the male leader does magical things, one of the women will pop in and do that even more than he could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can just do that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the new Nagual had 8 men first, they&amp;#39;d all be dead in a few months from ego attacks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or they&amp;#39;d turn into a group masturbation party and never get any further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, with 8 hot women maybe you can get the men to stay and behave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t work for Carlos. But there was money making in the way.  And maybe he just didn&amp;#39;t get enough time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If I don&amp;#39;t focus my attention on the world, the world collapses&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really, really does.  I did that last night several times, trying to switch my eyes into the mode for seeing energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point, it collapsed from me not focusing attention on it, specifically because I was halfway to focusing on energy only.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me explain that. Normally, to remove your focus and get the world to collapse, you have to work very hard to get the last traces of images from the mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case, your attention is zapped onto something else, not of this world. And it&amp;#39;s so compelling, it&amp;#39;s like a magnet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you can learn to do that, then stopping the world becomes easy and instant.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s just a feeling of glancing down and to the right.  But it has to be just the right direction, which I guess means just because you did it once, doesn&amp;#39;t mean you can do it twice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I succeed partially last night.  After asking my inorganic being to help me again.  She knows which direction to look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up standing on some strange yellow glowing surface, and could only see the lower half of my body. It was just a cloud of yellow/white.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then of course, the book deal mind got the best of me.  I was thinking of how to explain what you do, to switch the eyes into seeing energy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought maybe I could tip you guys off and save you some time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But instead of returning to my actual bedroom, as a result of letting my internal dialogue resume, I was in an alien &amp;quot;bamboo&amp;quot; forest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My bed, which I could only feel under my butt, was smack dab in the middle of thick stemmed plants.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was afraid to even take a step into it, knowing how bad bamboo forests can be on Mt. Ali in Taiwan. It&amp;#39;s wet down there, and the shoots can pierce your foot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said, out loud, &amp;quot;Where the hell am I?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My little fairy entity had been hanging around, even though she&amp;#39;s still flat from Cholita. I was hoping she&amp;#39;d come clear up the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I was back in my bedroom.  I guess she did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;or by gazing at the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More proof the witches are the real thing!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We always kind of need that, because of how women fit into sorcery groups.  It&amp;#39;s as I said earlier, they just need to be around, and they&amp;#39;ll find cool magic to do on their own.  So if you go back in time and look at old pictures of Carlos with women, it seems very much like they were mostly just hanging out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s good.  That is in fact how it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Cholita doesn&amp;#39;t have the same regard for all of the witches.  I won&amp;#39;t say why, but she claims some are more powerful than the others, and the ones that aren&amp;#39;t powerful aren&amp;#39;t worth listening to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I disagree.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I guarantee Cholita would have some critics if she were in their position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to the &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot;.  One of the witches taught the women in private class to gaze at the sky.  I was always curious why she didn&amp;#39;t teach men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s because women need gazing.  They&amp;#39;re already able to go far into the second attention, because of what you quoted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The men need to put their forehead on a stick, or make their fingers bleed, to learn silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gazing doesn&amp;#39;t get men all that far, other than to prove to them that the second attention is accessible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gazing, with men, takes them where it does, and it ends there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With women, I supposed they can take it from there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they need to learn where the gas pedal is located.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They need to learn to push the accelerator on demand, instead of only doing it while they&amp;#39;re laying in bed with cramps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we used to sit there for days until the crack would open.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, being the best hope for Carlos&amp;#39; teachings, I hope the eastern bloc is listening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a hobby. It&amp;#39;s not a little side business. It&amp;#39;s not something to tickle your fancy, because you can talk to yourself all day long about how much progress your making, and how many friends you have who are also on the &amp;quot;path with heart&amp;quot;, how much inventory you&amp;#39;ve collected from Carlos fans and gossip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to actually do very hard work or you get nowhere, very very slowly.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe Wayne corrected the story of the Buddha reaching enlightenment just because he decided to, sitting at that tree for a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least that&amp;#39;s the way I always heard it. I was worried where he got lunch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was only a day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he had practice before that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I still like the idea.  Just plop yourself down, shut up, and learn to get silent and summon the second attention.  Gaze if you have to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But stop all the talking and talking, if you want the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was rather the capacity to change levels of attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would dare to say, you aren&amp;#39;t even on the path until you can do at least a little of that, for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone&amp;#39;s reading this and thinking you just can&amp;#39;t put in the time needed, you might be right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos saw to it that I continued to have plenty of time, by making me celibate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you don&amp;#39;t have the time, then cheat.  Use a simple form of mantric meditation.  Just repeat, &amp;quot;Aing... Aing...&amp;quot; over and over.  Don&amp;#39;t force it, just do that gently, to suspend the internal dialogue, without too much suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll drift your assemblage point.

They're a glowing bathroom floor heater. The heater doesn't care if you stand in it's glow. It's no loss to the heater.\n\nMy best guess is, women are looking for a lifestyle, as one of the women in here said. And on a slightly darker note, they're looking for a place to stay.\n\nWhich makes them easier to enlist.\n\nIf you consider their behavior, it's almost like they're born to erase personal history. They're taught to find a man, and go live in his world.  And how many of you men have been on a date, and had no idea what the woman had been up to before that?\n\nThey're also closer to taking responsibility for their actions than men are.\n\nIn fact, the whole \"warrior's way\" thing might have a heavy female influence.  The Chacmools were female after all (the original ones from the pyramids).\n\nNearly all men suck.  They're gigantic babies, demanding attention everywhere they go.  They're so bad, they'll throw a temper tantrum while insisting they aren't only looking for attention.\n\nThe more impeccable they talk, the worse they are.  They've mostly on gigantic ego trips, and will even get violent when their ego isn't getting what they want.\n\nIn the back of their thinking, there's always a book deal of some kind looming, which alters their behavior in sinister ways.\n\nThey're so noisy inside, they don't even admit to themselves what a wreck they are.  And because they've come to expect no one else can figure that out, they feel entitled to be aggressive when caught.\n\nNotice how they went out and trashed Carlos after he died, some of it based on all the women around him and his handling of them.\n\nFor the very things that proved Carlos was genuine, short of doing that on your own by practice, they condemned him.\n\nBut there are other types of men.  Nerd types can occasionally be reasonable.\n\nI'd also like to add, that in order to make sorcery work you need *intent* on your side.\n\nI learned that too.  I watched the ups and downs of changing intent, as a result of talking to new people.\n\nIf *intent* is NOT on your side, you can still try all of  Carlos techniques, but you won't get the occasional boost.\n\nAn example of a boost is, last night I was doing tensegrity to move my assemblage point, and I saw an intense patch of purple, with yellow swirling in it.\n\nI've only rarely seen a thing like that.\n\nIn the middle was a woman's face.  I'd like to think it was the Fairy entity I trained, but it was too flat to be sure.\n\nShe smiled at me, turned her head to the left, and seemed to be looking at the wall.\n\nI gazed at the wall overall to see what she was looking at, and caught a glimpse of light leaking through the door to the right.  I have a towel stuffed down there, but Cholita was remodeling the house and had all the lights still on, at midnight.\n\nYou can find things like that light leakage out of the corner of your eye. It seems to be more sensitive. Don Juan used to advise Carlos to use that part of the eye, on specific occasions.\n\nI looked back to the woman's face, and she squinted her eyes.   It was sort of a blank concentrated gaze, with emphasis of peripheral vision.\n\nHow she communicated that, I  don't know.  But it was obvious she was teaching me.\n\nI did the same open room gaze, and the entire wall lit up.\n\nSo I thanked her.  She turned her head down, like an acknowledgement she got the message.\n\nEvery time I did that odd squint technique, it was as if there were enough light coming in the room to see the walls.\n\nBut there wasn't.  I stopped the \"gaze\" and it went back to normal. Only puffs of purple light here and there.\n\nI've managed to get so silent that I can see the room in darkness, but this was different. It wasn't an accident. It was a technique I could learn to do on demand.\n\nA very rare thing.\n\nTwice I caught a glimpse of something impossible, only visible when I did that squint.  A man or two ran across my view, made entirely out of bluish white light, and only visible while doing that squint.\n\nThey animated at full speed.  Perfect detail.\n\nIt was as if they were \"caught\", red handed, lurking around.\n\nOr maybe, Mr. DoubleTake was caught.\n\nHe'd been hiding all that available light from me, in order to cover up those 2 beings.  It seems they're only visible when the eyes are used that way.\n\nWhen I did the gaze, I could see not only the wall but also the nightstand to the left of it.\n\nAnd after the first few tries, the impossible beings were nowhere to be seen.\n\nI tried that technique the rest of the night, and in the morning while it was still dark.\n\nAnd in the sunlight the next day, hunting for grocery products for Cholita.\n\nIt seems to work.\n\nBut darned if you could explain to anyone how to do that. Or even write the technique down.  If I told people how to do that gaze, beginners would go around squinting their eyes, and figure out how to pretend it was working.\n\nOver the years, there's been too many squinty Castaneda pretenders. We don't need more.  \n\nMaybe that's why Carlos didn't like to go into the details of his techniques.\n\nSome things you just have to discover on your own.\n\nThat's why you need to be hooked to the *intent* of Carlos. Or as he called it, \"The *Intent* of the Sorcerer's of Ancient Mexico.\"\n\nI doubt being hooked to a  me-too Nagual's intent to defraud you of your money will help much. Even if he learned from his friend Julio, who claims to be part of a lineage of his own.\n\nIn fact, it's likely to hurt you. You go to learn from outsiders at your own peril.\n\nAs don Juan said, \"There's no game without the Nagual.\"\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1585931252.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fmbod8e", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out it was valuable for restoring Carlos&amp;#39; legacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what  I learned:  Female students are no trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that you have no idea what they want.

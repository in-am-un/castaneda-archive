The finger wiggling Zuleica showed Carlos was a touch thing.\n\nI suppose, because Carlos adopted it for tensegrity it had to be visual.\n\nBut Zuleica gave instructions for the visual path too. Remember? You can suck the colors in from the inside. It was one of the ways to build the second attention energy body.\n\nIt\u2019s all about moving those colors closer to the center. Our energy body starts out too diffuse to be useful.\n\nYou complete either method by touching the floor with a tentacle.\n\nTouching the floor with a tentacle is why the sweeping movement is in that pass.\n\nDon\u2019t just scoop, or you\u2019ll hold yourself back. The hips rotate slightly, and move side to side a few inches.  And the fingers \u201cflick\u201d at the end of the scoop.\n\nWarning: Speculation coming next. Half from what Cholita taught me.\n\nThe rotation encourages a \u201ctentacle\u201d to flow out and touch the floor. Normally they flow horizontally and slightly downward to light up the emanations in the environment, like radar. I\u2019ve seen Cholita do that. The tentacles move around, and light up emanations as far away as 8-20 feet. It looks a little like standing in a field of dry wheat stalks at twilight, and lighting up the ones near to you with a wide flashlight beam.\n\nThe tiny fibers (the apron) refine the perception.\n\nAnd the horizontal movement of the hips \u201csweeps\u201d the floor with the tentacle, lured to go down there by the hip rotation and your *intent*.\n\nCarlos made a point of correcting the fine details of the rocking movement.\n\nScooping is obvious, everyone got that.\n\nBut after demonstrating the hip movements himself, with the finger flick being the icing on the cake, he walked out, silently, to watch each person do it.\n\nI was first, after he glanced at the people side stage (the inner circle people).\n\nHe had a weird grin on his face. It\u2019s the kind of grin you\u2019d picture on a tiger, while it sized you up to see if it would be easy to take you out.\n\nI panicked, and tried to change my finger flick, my hip rotation, and the side to side sway.\n\nWatching me he didn\u2019t indicate I got it right, but after seeing the slight variations I was aware of he nodded his head up and down once to let me know I could fix it from there, and walked off.\n\nWhen you do the finger wiggle method, on the point of the second attention,  you are sitting on the floor the way Carlos did. So it\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d to fold in half. Then the goal is to stand up in your energy body. To do that, you have to push yourself up with a tentacle.\n\n(All this from Eagle\u2019s Gift; search for \u201cZuleica\u201d and start reading).\n\nTaisha was also taught a visually oriented method, by the very same Zuleica who taught Carlos a touch oriented method (in response to him feeling like he was tickling himself).\n\nZuleica\u2019s Pass is a visually oriented introduction to the second attention energy body, suitable for group practice.\n\nAs you do it, you will eventually see that your stomach is glowing, and a few inches fatter than you really are. I predict a dull yellow white glow.\n\nThis is not from the hands sweeping purple light there. That\u2019s just to get you to look for light in that region. Same as \u201cunbending intent\u201d long form at 5:22. You grab those puffs and put them on your stomach, in order to bring the diffused glow of the second attention closer to your body.\n\nYou \u201csuck it in\u201d from the inside, is how I believe Zuleica put it.\n\nSo Zuleica\u2019s pass does that, it collects the light closer to the torso.\n\nBut it\u2019s your attention that will let you see the second attention energy body.\n\nFirst find the dull grey fibers waving around from just below the stomach, and then look for yellow flashes.\n\nThe flashes don\u2019t have to be tentacle shaped. It\u2019s so difficult to get a view of that, you\u2019ll end up changing them into something else. But just seeing the flashes is a good thing.\n\nKeep it up, and eventually you\u2019ll not only see the tentacles, but also be able to count them!\n\nTrouble is, they circulate around, so you will only be able to count some of them, while the others are not in view.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like to touch the floor while doing that movement?\n\nI haven\u2019t succeeded yet.\n\nI have touched the floor with a tentacle, but it was while sitting on the bed, not while standing.\n\nIt felt exactly like I had pressed my palm on the wooden floor, except that the bed was in the way.\n\nIt was impossible to do that.\n\nWhich brings up a point. I\u2019ll just pose it as a question, since I don\u2019t have the answer.\n\nWhen Taisha learned to get her dreaming double to travel down to the ground, so she could practice martial arts in the treehouse, was that the same as touching the floor with a tentacle?\n\n\\&gt;How is the switch done? Any tip?\n\nTwo ways. Best is, you become aware of the second attention energy body, can visually see it, and suddenly you get the very weird idea that it can \u201cwalk away\u201d from your physical body.\n\nIt\u2019s like when I leaped through the wall because a window to another world opened up.\n\nNo way would I get up and leap at the wall in the dark room on my own! I\u2019m not that stupid.\n\nBut I just knew I could do it, and did it.\n\n*Knowing* was probably a switch over to 90% dreaming double.\n\nSame happens with Zuleica\u2019s pass. You become aware of the second attention energy body. You stop to look at it. You realize you can count the tentacles that are visible to you. And then you get the very strange idea that it can walk off.\n\nBut you\u2019re too rational. As it walks away a few inches, you pull it back with your rationality.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t, and it got completely away from you, it would probably transform into the dreaming double at some point.\n\nThat\u2019s speculation too, but not harmful speculation.\n\nThe other way to switch over to the dreaming double is to let it materialize, instead of \u201cstep out\u201d.\n\nIt materializes anywhere, that\u2019s the trouble with that method. And a minor blank out (forgetting your purpose) is inevitable. How fast you recover from the shock of changing bodies is what\u2019s up for grabs.\n\nIn my case, the most common thing is that it materializes outside my bedroom, looking for Cholita and Minx. And while I get over the blank out quickly, I never recover the \u201cOh Shit!!!! I\u2019m in my dreaming double now!\u201d\n\nSo no fun\u2026 You just ARE at that point.\n\nWhat that feels like is best learned by trying to stop the world.\n\nLook for the blankouts, which come with \u201ccontext\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a mini-dream.\n\nBut, you\u2019ll think you screwed up, since stopping the world requires intense concentration on perfect silence.\n\nWhen you do that right it becomes \u201csmooth\u201d. If you can keep the smooth silence up the world will either stop, or you\u2019ll bounce off it into another realm.\n\nWhile trying to get your silence smooth (automatic and effortless), you\u2019ll \u201cscrew up\u201d.\n\nOr so you think. You might tilt forward an inch, and feel your head jerk. Or lean left or right, as if you lost balance.\n\nThat can be accompanied by a tap on the back, or a pop sound in the neck, followed by tingling up the entire body.\n\nTap on back: IOB \u201chelp\u201d.\n\nPop in neck: Second attention is \"coming out\".\n\nBut you can also just seem to forget you were supposed to be forcing silence, you curse yourself for vanishing like that, not realizing that what really happened was your dreaming double came out and you intercepted the dreaming context.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t internal dialogue; it was knowledge of the flow of awareness of the dreaming double.\n\nGetting that while trying to stop the world means, you\u2019re almost there!\n\nYou \u201cbounce off\u201d stopping the world, when you just go with one of the dream switches.\n\nThey\u2019re so entertaining, who wants to stop it!!??\n\nAnd then there\u2019s re-runs\u2026 Those are \u201cchange overs\u201d offered to you with a turn of the head.\n\nI suppose your dreaming double is already somewhere else, and your tonal senses its location.\n\nYou can turn your head that direction to catch up with it.\n\nIt\u2019s moved in time, not just space.\n\nWhen someone turns their head for the first time, please pay close attention to the precise path it takes while turning. I\u2019d like that info.\n\nHow much, horizontal only, up or down a bit? Shoulders move too?  Head too, independent of what the torso is doing?  Did you sort of \"fall\" into it, or \"dive\"?\n\nAnd turn it back at least once, so you can do it again.  You can turn right back to your bed.\n\nBut don\u2019t keep that up too long.  Going back and forth.\n\nIt\u2019s like those Russians who beat themselves on the back with a palm frond after the sauna,  and just before jumping into 0 degree swimming pools.\n\nDon\u2019t whack yourself too many times.\n\nI\u2019m afraid you might get into trouble.", "edited": 1606596018.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gdwfsys", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;I wonder how to complete the pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I named it \u201cZuleica\u2019s Pass\u201d, because it\u2019s an alternative to finger wiggling, but is completed the same way as Zuleica\u2019s instructions to Carlos in their dark house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos never gave it a name, but it was the first pass he taught me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a visual thing, not a touch thing.  The finger wiggling Zuleica showed Carlos was a touch thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose, because Carlos adopted it for tensegrity it had to be visual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Zuleica gave instructions for the visual path too. Remember? You can suck the colors in from the inside. It was one of the ways to build the second attention energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s all about moving those colors closer to the center. Our energy body starts out too diffuse to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You complete either method by touching the floor with a tentacle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Touching the floor with a tentacle is why the sweeping movement is in that pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t just scoop, or you\u2019ll hold yourself back. The hips rotate slightly, and move side to side a few inches.  And the fingers \u201cflick\u201d at the end of the scoop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warning: Speculation coming next. Half from what Cholita taught me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rotation encourages a \u201ctentacle\u201d to flow out and touch the floor. Normally they flow horizontally and slightly downward to light up the emanations in the environment, like radar. I\u2019ve seen Cholita do that. The tentacles move around, and light up emanations as far away as 8-20 feet. It looks a little like standing in a field of dry wheat stalks at twilight, and lighting up the ones near to you with a wide flashlight beam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tiny fibers (the apron) refine the perception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the horizontal movement of the hips \u201csweeps\u201d the floor with the tentacle, lured to go down there by the hip rotation and your &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos made a point of correcting the fine details of the rocking movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scooping is obvious, everyone got that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after demonstrating the hip movements himself, with the finger flick being the icing on the cake, he walked out, silently, to watch each person do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was first, after he glanced at the people side stage (the inner circle people).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had a weird grin on his face. It\u2019s the kind of grin you\u2019d picture on a tiger, while it sized you up to see if it would be easy to take you out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I panicked, and tried to change my finger flick, my hip rotation, and the side to side sway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching me he didn\u2019t indicate I got it right, but after seeing the slight variations I was aware of he nodded his head up and down once to let me know I could fix it from there, and walked off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you do the finger wiggle method, on the point of the second attention,  you are sitting on the floor the way Carlos did. So it\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d to fold in half. Then the goal is to stand up in your energy body. To do that, you have to push yourself up with a tentacle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(All this from Eagle\u2019s Gift; search for \u201cZuleica\u201d and start reading).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taisha was also taught a visually oriented method, by the very same Zuleica who taught Carlos a touch oriented method (in response to him feeling like he was tickling himself).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica\u2019s Pass is a visually oriented introduction to the second attention energy body, suitable for group practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you do it, you will eventually see that your stomach is glowing, and a few inches fatter than you really are. I predict a dull yellow white glow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not from the hands sweeping purple light there. That\u2019s just to get you to look for light in that region. Same as \u201cunbending intent\u201d long form at 5:22. You grab those puffs and put them on your stomach, in order to bring the diffused glow of the second attention closer to your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You \u201csuck it in\u201d from the inside, is how I believe Zuleica put it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Zuleica\u2019s pass does that, it collects the light closer to the torso.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it\u2019s your attention that will let you see the second attention energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First find the dull grey fibers waving around from just below the stomach, and then look for yellow flashes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The flashes don\u2019t have to be tentacle shaped. It\u2019s so difficult to get a view of that, you\u2019ll end up changing them into something else. But just seeing the flashes is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep it up, and eventually you\u2019ll not only see the tentacles, but also be able to count them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trouble is, they circulate around, so you will only be able to count some of them, while the others are not in view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s it like to touch the floor while doing that movement?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven\u2019t succeeded yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have touched the floor with a tentacle, but it was while sitting on the bed, not while standing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It felt exactly like I had pressed my palm on the wooden floor, except that the bed was in the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was impossible to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which brings up a point. I\u2019ll just pose it as a question, since I don\u2019t have the answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Taisha learned to get her dreaming double to travel down to the ground, so she could practice martial arts in the treehouse, was that the same as touching the floor with a tentacle?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;How is the switch done? Any tip?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two ways. Best is, you become aware of the second attention energy body, can visually see it, and suddenly you get the very weird idea that it can \u201cwalk away\u201d from your physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s like when I leaped through the wall because a window to another world opened up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No way would I get up and leap at the wall in the dark room on my own! I\u2019m not that stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I just knew I could do it, and did it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowing&lt;/em&gt; was probably a switch over to 90% dreaming double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same happens with Zuleica\u2019s pass. You become aware of the second attention energy body. You stop to look at it. You realize you can count the tentacles that are visible to you. And then you get the very strange idea that it can walk off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you\u2019re too rational. As it walks away a few inches, you pull it back with your rationality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you didn\u2019t, and it got completely away from you, it would probably transform into the dreaming double at some point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s speculation too, but not harmful speculation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other way to switch over to the dreaming double is to let it materialize, instead of \u201cstep out\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It materializes anywhere, that\u2019s the trouble with that method. And a minor blank out (forgetting your purpose) is inevitable. How fast you recover from the shock of changing bodies is what\u2019s up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case, the most common thing is that it materializes outside my bedroom, looking for Cholita and Minx. And while I get over the blank out quickly, I never recover the \u201cOh Shit!!!! I\u2019m in my dreaming double now!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So no fun\u2026 You just ARE at that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What that feels like is best learned by trying to stop the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for the blankouts, which come with \u201ccontext\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a mini-dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, you\u2019ll think you screwed up, since stopping the world requires intense concentration on perfect silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you do that right it becomes \u201csmooth\u201d.

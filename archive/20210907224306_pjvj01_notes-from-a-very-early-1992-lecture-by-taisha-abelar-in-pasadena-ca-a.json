When the filiaments of the energetic body match those of the universe perception takes place.\n\nHow do you move the assemblage point? You need energy - this may be obtained from not doing the presentation of the self in everyday life and stopping seeking courtship. curtail needingness.\n\nAfter you've increased your energy THEN practice sorceric techniques.\n\n\\-1. The recapitulation (see Sorcerer's crossing)\n\n\\-2. Quiet the internal dialogue (Meditation and breathing techniques are good for this)\n\n((Taisha told a rather amusing story of going to a guru in India who had a $900 breathing technique))\n\nThe $900 dollar breath: 3 exhalations, 1 inhalation\n\n(Use) any technique that works - sorcery passes, gazing techniques.\n\nPractice impeccability, you'll know impeccability when you have no self interest. Act without expecting rewards or returns. Act impeccably and the assemblage point moves to the\" place of no pity \"\n\nHeightened awareness. When the assemblage point moves far enough you'll see different worlds.\n\nYou'll know when you are there - (you'll be) very quiet, unknown to yourself,  you'll feel solitude but not loneliness.\n\nEnergy comes to you and will guide you, energy of the double, the ethereal body. \" Poor Baby\" ravages energy. That's the beginning, heightened awareness is the door to infinity.\n\nNOW you can use dreaming and stalking.\n\nDreaming, use dreams to enhance awareness of being, wake up the energetic body. The art of dreaming - move the assemblage point systematically (find your hands, etc.)\n\nArt of stalking - when assemblage point moves you have to fix it at new position - give it reality - explore, get adventuresome.\n\nfind out the ramifications of the new position from a bodily energy viewpoint. Then develop the energetic body.\n\nUse it (while awake).\n\nSolidify it and act from it.\n\nWhere Taisha Abelar is is a poistion of the assemblage point.\n\nMoving assemblage point to where their's (other sorcerers) were.\n\nThe earth too has an assemblage point ((cf. Ley lines etc.))\n\nembarrassment disrupts the assemblage point.\n\nThere are other worlds than this consensual world.\n\nNagual - pronounced \" NO - ALL\"\n\nYou can move the assemblage point in dreaming.\n\n(( Taisha Abelar made a loud scream at this point in the talk))\n\nShriek - makes the assemblage point shift and solidify the energy body.\n\nFor a normal human the assemblage point is behind the left shoulder at the back.\n\nPerception is encoded in the body (cf. Husserl, phenomenologists)\n\nPerception - a facet of corporeality.\n\nThe only way to change the energy body is to move the assemblage point, lighting up different filiaments.\n\nMemories can reengage, restimulate different energetic memories.\n\nDream yourself, its up to you\n\nA man waits for death and while he waits he surrounds himself with beauty and with strength \" The Death Defier\"\n\nThe change comes from within, to change the world, the environment, the universe.\n\nYou must move the assemblage point\n\nRecapitulation - make list of everyone you've known begin with the latest person and work backwards\n\nBreath in over right shoulder to left then exhale back (rotating the head back) - visualize and breath you can do it in the world.\n\nDon't poor baby yourself.\n\nUse devices to jolt yourself you can move the assemblage point up and down.\n\n(( She talks about her experiences in the other world with the trees (described in Sorcerer's Crossing)))\n\nCompetition among the roots of trees (not recommended to move the Assemblage point down)\n\nThe greatest challenge - practice controlled folly, you see the situation and you don't do anything about it - you don't judge - judging is death.\n\nInorganic entities, they permeate this other realm of the universe.\n\nDon Juan's/Carlo's new book The Seven Gates of Dreaming The second gate is these guys - Gargoyles/vampires/shadows they inhabit a close realm and feed off our energy.\n\nDon Juan's allys.\n\nSeers can see this energy. Build integrity - internal strength.\n\nGazing at gravel/leaves/moon/clouds\n\nBut if you don't have the sobriety of recapitulation then there are hazards.\n\nThe Inorganic Entities come thru tunnels, ignore them. The Inorganic Entities obey your commands.\n\nYou can recapitualte your dreams or recapitulate in your dreams. If awake Normal recapitulation start at right inhale to left, exhale to center.\n\nIn dreams inhale Clockwise, exhale counterclockwise in center.\n\nThere are layers of recapitulation.\n\nBest place for assemblage point - an infinite number of other places. The spirit, intent, will let it move , Best intermediate place - \"The place of no pity\"\n\nDo the newspaper exercise (looking for \"poor baby\")\n\nTake a pen and paper to your internal dialogue.\n\nScratch the surface, stalk yourself.\n\nTaisha Abelar and her fellow sorcerers are now moving assemblage points elsewhere and using energetic bodies to establish realities there.\n\nProper use of sexual energy. if you've got energy to spare - (sex is)) OK if you've recapitualted.\n\nIf you want to move the assemblage point to other areas use sexual energy to do dreaming.\n\nThe second gate is the graveyard of failed sorcerers.\n\nControl, the stalker's sobriety.\n\nlevel 1 energy body\n\nlevel 2 energy and physical body (this needs lots more energy)\n\n((the above is describing 'going places' via dreaming as an energy body or taking the physical body too))\n\nAfter recapitulating there is only NOW.\n\nThis permits discrepancies - coming and going from the consensual universe.\n\nWhen moving the assemblage point either:\n\n\\-1. Get rid of friends\n\n\\-2. Use them as controlled folly.\n\nThe world has multitudes of realities\n\nThe real challenge is in the world - can you get off the assemblage point position?\n\nStalking - move assemblage point, give the energy body a jolt.\n\n((an example of a stalking exercise follows)) Tie up the dominant hand and use the other.\n\nNot doing exercises\n\nWalk backwards\n\nWalk on all fours with kneepads\n\nany trigger - sound/time/smell causes the body to remember\n\ncover up mirrors - (they reinforce agreements and put attention on the self)\n\nStalk yourself\n\nlook at the world\n\nBegin recapitulation\n\nDream and find your hands in your dream\n\nNot doing\n\nDisrupt routines\n\nand do exercise to wake up the energetic body (physical exercise)\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nsource -

individual are at effect).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drills to resolve this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Write your internal dialogue down for 3 days, wait three days and read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mark up the newspaper wherever the poor baby concept is expressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We presently have a mating/courtship compulsion the self is presented as a &amp;quot;poor baby&amp;quot; to the world&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stalking the self - see how you are living.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason for all this is that mankind&amp;#39;s assemblage point is in a certain position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can move the assemblage point to another place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what sorcerers do - move it away from the poor baby position&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The assembalge point is a place of luminosity on the energetic body, it lights the filiaments. When the filiaments of the energetic body match those of the universe perception takes place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you move the assemblage point? You need energy - this may be obtained from not doing the presentation of the self in everyday life and stopping seeking courtship. curtail needingness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;#39;ve increased your energy THEN practice sorceric techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-1.

Use them as controlled folly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world has multitudes of realities&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real challenge is in the world - can you get off the assemblage point position?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stalking - move assemblage point, give the energy body a jolt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;((an example of a stalking exercise follows)) Tie up the dominant hand and use the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not doing exercises&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Walk backwards&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Walk on all fours with kneepads&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;any trigger - sound/time/smell causes

She told us we \"are very talented\"!!!\n\nBut in fact, we are not.\n\nOur only hope lies with *intent*.\n\nIf we work hard, *intent* might figure out what we're after, and \"gift\" us.\n\nBut if we work very hard on a \"shortcut\" we believe we have discovered, *intent* can't figure out what we really want.

Juan mentioned this one.\n\nOur goal is the one Carlos gave us.  It's been repeated in here many times, but things get buried.\n\nMaybe if we had an FAQ, we could add that to it.\n\nThe goal is to clean the connecting link to *intent*, and then *intent* will direct us what to do with it.\n\nYou do that by daily moving the assemblage point all the way to the end of the J curve.\n\nWhen the double comes out, you pay attention to his point of view, and yours, and you get the \"here and there\" points.\n\nTwo points of awareness.\n\nMoving from here to there, you learn about the third point of human perspective.\n\nDepth.\n\nOnce you see depth, the \"abstract\" becomes visible. It sort of \"oozes\" between all heres and theres, connecting them.\n\nIt's aware, but probably not alive.  Perhaps being \"glue\", it is also stuck to all of the awareness.\n\nThe abstract is in the realm of silent knowledge, but perhaps on steroids.  Some silent knowledge is mellow. The abstract is really hard to \"flatten out\".\n\nThrough the abstract you get tunnels in time and reality, among other things.\n\nYou can use it to \"re-run\" past sorcerers, or even Jesus Christ if you feel like it.\n\nNot that you get the kind of control to pick and choose.\n\nYou just get an \"offer\", and you turn your head to relive that event.\n\nBut the goal is to clean the connecting link to *intent*.\n\n*Intent* is our friend for life. Always has been.\n\nI'm always a little worried when I hear, \"what is the goal?\".\n\nIf you don't love magic, just because it's so fun, then you won't practice, so there's really nothing to talk about.\n\nYou probably have an advantage with the autism, so you aren't as driven towards magic as it would normally take to get the cool experiences you do.\n\nI also suspect you've redefined some things.  Maybe gotten a tiny bit scrambled with power plants.\n\nThat's common.\n\nWe had a person (got kicked out) a couple of weeks ago, who had redefined everything to fit with her ordinary dreams, so she could claim to have accomplished the \"bad ass\" things from the books.\n\nCould have been a \"he\", we never figured that out.\n\nHe or she just kept finding excuses to repeat the very few things, mostly not relevant, they'd accomplished. It became clear they only wanted attention, and not to work hard and learn.\n\nThe entire Castaneda community did that. It's so bad, in the eastern bloc they now claim I've been taken over by IOBs, so they can explain why they don't have to stop pretending.\n\nIn your case you aren't pretending at all, but I suspect you've redefined some things, and it's a big mess.\n\nMy story about the map to the gold mine is relevant. I'd add you as a skilled tracker, who went down a parallel trail.

That's just one of many excuses they use.\n\nHaving sorcery is always better than not having it, even in the absense of a goal.\n\nInternal silence is always more pleasant, than that chattering internal dialogue.\n\nNo goal is needed, other than, would  you like to keep suffering forever?\n\nTruth is, the \"confused\" ones simply can't find the time to practice, or don't want to find the time, but they still enjoy the topic.\n\nOr aren't allowed to find the time.\n\nAnd some have been even pretending for decades, that they are sorcerers.  So they're rather stuck. It's like the \"prettiest girl in school\",  when she finds out she's not.\n\nShe stands behind the lockers, and watches the competition to look for an opening.\n\nAnd some in here are simply lonely. If no one kicks their butt, they'll hang out because it all seems \"important\". Something they're missing in their life.\n\nSome are too crazy to have any friends, and have to be accepted in here as long as they don't mess things up.\n\nThe Jehovah's witnesses really know how to make  use of that type of person.\n\nWhich points out an important truth. All these \"types\" of people who won't give it a real try.\n\nYou CANNOT teach individuals.\n\nYou need hundreds, to get just one.\n\nOr, you need to do what don Juan and his lineage did.\n\nTrick someone by teaching them something they badly want, while you teach them the real thing, without them knowing.\n\nWe can't do that.\n\nAnd the phony sorcery teachers out there also cannot teach an individual.\n\nSo this subreddit is all that's between the loss of the teachings of don Juan, and keeping them around in their real form.\n\nTHAT'S my goal.\n\nNothing else.\n\nExcept to protect Cholita at the same time.", "edited": 1615237582.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gq94t63", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently you have a longer comment elsewhere.

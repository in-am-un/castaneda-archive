When someone says that without explaining more, you know they don&amp;#39;t have the experience to be saying that at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like some golfer claiming to have done 4 &amp;quot;hole in ones&amp;quot; in a row, at a real golf course. And not having anything to say about how can that be possible?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if the golfer doesn&amp;#39;t realize that&amp;#39;s next to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t even seem to realize what you&amp;#39;re saying needs more explaining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, it&amp;#39;s not real to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you&amp;#39;d explain from the point of view of someone who can really do that on demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re probably used to everyone in a discussion group being afraid to say anything about your claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t work in here, because we have actual real magic and are fighting for it&amp;#39;s survival.  It&amp;#39;s the last real magic visible on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no other out there on the net, which goes beyond simple shamanic drumming effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need to &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; what you felt daily for weeks, before thinking you know what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; something, and then make it fit with what you were told.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you meet with spirits over and over you realize there&amp;#39;s no such thing as demons. Nor are there angels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Humans don&amp;#39;t survive past death in that sort of form, and there&amp;#39;s no battle between Lucifer and God, giving rise to a subclass of angels known as demons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the point of view of ancient &amp;quot;prophets&amp;quot; who only saw their demons and archangels once or twice.  And then made up whatever they liked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which evolved into several particularly nasty religions that keep people prisoner with heavy brainwashing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live&amp;quot;, in all three.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All three afraid of the power of women because their &amp;quot;prophets&amp;quot; were liars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hopeless to learn real magic if you really believe what you said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the only way you&amp;#39;re going to realize this is to follow the instructions in here.  Yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s pretty clear you like pretending your magic in order to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No offense meant.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My job is just to give people the best chance to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to wait and see if  they study and come to realize they were confused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because in the meantime, they harm the chances of others to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_10kb389", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10kb389/question_the_nature_of_the_eagle/j5qxrid/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1674601451.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1674601451.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j5syl8c", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "tabdrops", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j5sw925", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_b9puh3b5", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Form of energy for sure.

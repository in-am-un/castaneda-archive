Don Juan was famous it, and Carlos said that he based Tensegrity on it.\n\nI tried it out last night to see if I could find answers.  There\u2019s so much to try, sometimes I just go with what someone asks, hoping it\u2019ll lead somewhere cool.

I\u2019m mentioning that because I want to report on the entire process of learning this for yourself, so that anyone interested can try it.  And the worst part of that process is getting over the barrier of doubt.  It\u2019s no less than trying to move the assemblage point out of its normal crappy position.\n\nWe don\u2019t really believe all this, because that\u2019s what holds our assemblage points in place.  Doubt is the guard, imposed on us by our upbringing.    So don\u2019t expect to be free from it, if you\u2019re in a normal state of consciousness.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s something that needs saying about \u201ctechniques. Let\u2019s take the technique of looking for colors in the darkness, as taught by Zuleica.   Zuleica wanted them to move from seeing the colors, to being encased in them.\n\nJosephina swished out of her furry poncho directly into her patch of color, and Zuleica removed her from practicing with La Gorda.\n\nLa Gorda took more time to get into her color, and because of that she fell in love with her fuzzy pajamas. Zuleica had designed them to stimulate the sides of the calves,  which is said to enhance the second attention.\n\nCarlos used harp playing movements to \u201cpull\u201d the colors back closer to him.\n\nWhy the differences in the results of the same technique?\n\nConsider one of the first \u201cprocedures\u201d taught to you by your mother.  She put a piece of paper in front of you, set some crayons on the table, and showed you how to hold the crayon and make colored lines on the paper.  It\u2019s a procedure that produces consistent results.\n\nBut if you try that in the second attention, one person is likely to learn how to spray colors from the end of the crayon, another will find that he can draw something and it comes to life, another might find that the crayon draws by itself.\n\nOnce you\u2019re using the second attention, procedures don\u2019t work as predictably as you\u2019re used to.  And describing what happened to you can almost become a lie, if stated in a straight forward account.\n\nKeep that in mind.   Here\u2019s what I found out about joint cracking, but someone else might find out something different.  And that\u2019s fine.  What you saw is what you saw.\n\nMashing energy with the feet turns out to be a joint cracking exercise. The result is fibers of twisted light which are stirred or fluffed up by the movements of the foot.  The light settles around the immediate area, perhaps within a 3 foot diameter, and after many repetitions you can see how far your energy has risen from your feet.  A depressing number of repetitions I might add.   It\u2019s a weak technique.\n\nLobster strike has the same effect, except that the fibers of light fluff off from around the shoulder area.  The first time I tried it, a bright white spot the size of a dime flew off from my shoulder, and darted off  into the darkness.\n\nSeeing colored spots is a common experience when looking for colors in the darkness.  They are likely to be the first \u201cdirectional\u201d thing you see, meaning, they don\u2019t follow the movement of your head.  The fibers of distorted light follow your head for the most part, as do the bright colors. Except that they\u2019re actually following your whole body, so if you turn just your head, you get a different result.\n\nThe dots of color are independant, almost as if alive. They come in very intense blue, less bright but very hot looking red, and white fuzzy spots.  The behavior of each color is different, but the unique thing about them is that they move off on their own, flying past the other colors and lines you see in darkness. They are \u201cdirectional\u201d.\n\nBut what they are is unknown to me.    Someone who writes to me and sees the same dots, claims the blue ones are death reflecting off our luminous cocoon.\n\nCracking the joints of the fingers produces hues of red and orange.  If you\u2019re scooping the colors and lines with your hands, cracking the knuckles in the middle of a patch of light will change its hue.\n\nIt can also cause the injection of jet black, if the patch of color is very bright. The jet black mixed with the strong color produces strong borders, which spin off into dream images.\n\nWhen \u201creading off the wall\u201d, the text forms in that manner.  I suspect that technique is an off-shoot of don Juan joking that Carlos should learn to take notes with his finger.\n\nContinued use of any but the mashing energy with the feet technique, seems to produce less and less results, until there\u2019s none.    In the case of cracking the knuckles of the hand, the eventual result is that the very bright fibers of energy controlled by the hand, normally only visible with very profound silence, form shapes that look like tools.  The hand seems to be a very complex thing, from an energetic point of view.\n\nI was curious about Howard Lee\u2019s technique.  You spread your legs about shoulder width, and lean back while curving your spine and looking up.  My guess was, it\u2019s also a joint cracking technique.\n\nThe technique works like Lobster Strike, except that it lights up all the fibers in front of and above you. Instead of energy fluffing off of something, what energy you see in front of you (perhaps the inside of the luminous cocoon) gets brighter as you lean back.  I suspect Howard used that boost of second attention in his students, to move their assemblage points to the great band of emanations he calls, \u201cThe Light of Life\u201d.\n\nHoward is a joint cracker too?\n\nI couldn\u2019t think of any other joints to crack, but the effect of the ones I tested seem to be a strengthening of the second attention, perhaps because of redeployment of energy as Carlos said.\n\nAbout Zuleica\u2019s fuzzy pajamas which are said to enhance the second attention by stimulating the calves:\n\nCarlos didn\u2019t want us to make those, or he wouldn\u2019t have mentioned that La Gorda made her own pajamas, and they didn\u2019t work like Zuleica\u2019s.\n\nBut never fear, you can have your own fuzzy pajamas. And these ones will work!\n\nI discovered this by accident. It was a bit cold, so I turned on a little room heater.  I was walking around looking at colors in the darkness.  I noticed that I had better results when I stood in a certain spot, and realized that the heater was blowing warm air onto my calves.   I decided to align it to a certain part of the room where I was walking back and forth.\n\nIt works.   It\u2019s nothing to write home about, but if it\u2019s cold, you can get that added benefit by directing the heater to your lower legs.  It also creates hot and cold currents of air, which can teach you how to \u201cfeel\u201d energy, instead of just seeing it visually in the dark.\n\nYou can also learn to \u201chear\u201d energy, but that\u2019s another story.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Speculations on Joint Cracking", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_bkb5aj", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 10, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 10, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1556906738.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1556904791.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone asked if I knew anything about joint cracking.

For example, if you're seeing what appears to be part of the luminous shell (from pulling colors towards the assemblage point for the second attention), they can drift in and out of perception.  Sort of show up, then fade because your perception (or level of silence) can't hold that.\n\nIf you guys learn to see colors and want to try Zuleica's technique for pulling the colors closer to yourself, I can assure you it works. And any distance gain with the colors, closer to you, seems to be fairly permanent.   For example, it used to be that I had to wait around for an hour or so if I wanted to see intense purple patches.   And they almost always formed in a specific place in front of me, perhaps on the edge of the luminous cocoon, straight ahead, and up and to the right by a foot or two.\n\nMy prejudice right now (and it could change) is that the colors are part of our own luminous cocoon, and you're peering inside of it.\n\nNow, after pulling on the colors for around a week,  almost as soon as I start being silent in the dark there are vague purple puffs right up against my body.  And then after an hour, some of those turn intense purple.  But they aren't limited to being out in front of me, at arms length, as before.  It's a little confusing when they move closer. It's also a painfully slow process, thus the need for shoulder cracking, or any other thing that makes it easier.\n\nDuring that time, you can indeeed feel a connection between the second attention assemblage point (or your chest if that's easier to visualize) and the right calf. There are fibers, like dusty cobwebs, which brush across the arm as you pull, and give off a tingle which extends to the calf, even with the arms nowhere near that location.\n\nIt's quite remarkable!  I didn't have that in mind at all, they were just there as Zuleica said.\n\nSo cracking the shoulder firms up colors being *seen* in the dark.  It can be done a couple of times close together, but then it wears out.\n\nI concluded that cracking the joints is a sorcerer's attempt to make use of moving various parts of the body, perhaps during the act of *seeing,* in order to enhance or sustain the *seeing*.  They're trying to make use of anything they have, since it's so difficult to *see*.\n\nIt's kind of logical that they'd come up with that!  Like everything else Carlos taught, it follows automatically from silence.\n\nCracking the knuckles also helps with some things, but it's sort of more localized.  You\u2019d want the thing you were *seeing* to be associated with the location of the hands, to make use of that.  While messing around I caught a fairy in my hand (a hypnogogic image in a fairly pleasing female form), and it stuck for a bit.  It started to fade, I cracked my knuckles, and the image got stronger. It was even stuck on my hand long enough for me to move it around, and the creature I was viewing started changing costumes, and showing me more of it's entire body instead of just the head.  I got quite a fashion show, which included military uniforms and short, white single piece dresses.\n\nThe mashing energy pass (which is like cracking toe joints) still only lightens up the immediate area around the feet, with a yellow glow.  Carlos associated that with some kind of specific use, like for  a quick burst of energy for running.\n\nIn doing that, he set up the idea that each technique has an actual practical use.\n\nAfter about 3 hours of that kind of thing, I went to sleep and found I was seeing \"the wall\" with my eyes closed.  That's right at the door of heightened awareness.\n\nSo apparently, we can coax ourselves into heightened awareness on demand, if we have a few hours, and have been saving enough energy not to be too tired to try it.  And aren't noisy in our internal dialogue of course.\n\nWhile doing that (in an attempt to form the energy body as Zuleica explained) I realized, Carlos had embedded that technique in Tensegrity.  So doing tensegrity automatically puts us in the position to get the results of Zuleica's dreaming technique for forming the energy body.  Some of the passes that is.\n\nI'm not sure what would work if you didn't learn to get silent, so doing tensegrity as your main technique, for decades, is still a question mark to me.   Not sure how far you'd get into *seeing*.\n\nEdited four times.", "edited": 1557171980.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_emiaosx", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried this again last night, but focused on the results of cracking joints, instead of what could be &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; coming from that specific area, while cracking them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cracking joints does indeed firm up perception.

It can be done a couple of times close together, but then it wears out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I concluded that cracking the joints is a sorcerer&amp;#39;s attempt to make use of moving various parts of the body, perhaps during the act of &lt;em&gt;seeing,&lt;/em&gt; in order to enhance or sustain the &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.  They&amp;#39;re trying to make use of anything they have, since it&amp;#39;s so difficult to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s kind of logical that they&amp;#39;d come up with that!  Like everything else Carlos taught, it follows automatically from silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cracking the knuckles also helps with some things, but it&amp;#39;s sort of more localized.  You\u2019d want the thing you were &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; to be associated with the location of the hands, to make use of that.  While messing around I caught a fairy in my hand (a hypnogogic image in a fairly pleasing female form), and it stuck for a bit.  It started to fade, I cracked my knuckles, and the image got stronger. It was even stuck on my hand long enough for me to move it around, and the creature I was viewing started changing costumes, and showing me more of it&amp;#39;s entire body instead of just the head.  I got quite a fashion show, which included military uniforms and short, white single piece dresses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mashing energy pass (which is like cracking toe joints) still only lightens up the immediate area around the feet, with a yellow glow.  Carlos associated that with some kind of specific use, like for  a quick burst of energy for running.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In doing that, he set up the idea that each technique has an actual practical use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After about 3 hours of that kind of thing, I went to sleep and found I was seeing &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot; with my eyes closed.  That&amp;#39;s right at the door of heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So apparently, we can coax ourselves into heightened awareness on demand, if we have a few hours, and have been saving enough energy not to be too tired to try it.  And aren&amp;#39;t noisy in our internal dialogue of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While doing that (in an attempt to form the energy body as Zuleica explained) I realized, Carlos had embedded that technique in Tensegrity.  So doing tensegrity automatically puts us in the position to get the results of Zuleica&amp;#39;s dreaming technique for forming the energy body.  Some of the passes that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what would work if you didn&amp;#39;t learn to get silent, so doing tensegrity as your main technique, for decades, is still a question mark to me.   Not sure how far you&amp;#39;d get into &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited four times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/bkb5aj/speculations_on_joint_cracking/emiaosx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1556997496.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_bkb5aj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "emkiwh1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_emk04mt", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Yes, I think so.

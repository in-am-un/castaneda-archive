Because you aren't asleep!\n\nIt's very distracting!  You literally have to lay in the right position to try it, because you never actually go to sleep.  If you did it sitting up, you'd topple over and get hurt.\n\nSo you lay down in SK, in a safe position, then when you go directly into the dream,which only takes a few seconds, you lay in the same position you are using in the waking world, and go to sleep inside the dream.\n\nYou NEVER went to sleep in the real world.\n\nOnly in the dream.", "edited": 1663194146.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_iogc3d9", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure.

Anyone who&amp;#39;s found their hands for a few months, regularly, could certainly go to sleep inside a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason is simple.  You don&amp;#39;t become lucid in the dream, and then find your hands, and then go to sleep.  Remembering which &amp;quot;twin position&amp;quot; you went to sleep in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is SO unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But by the time you reach the 3rd gate you should have learned to go directly into dreaming, using Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Afterall, you&amp;#39;ve been learning from the dreaming emissary in their own world, at the second gate.  Holding dreams for hours, using dark energy from the IOB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By then you&amp;#39;ll be able to go directly into dreaming for sure! No need to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And THEN you go to sleep in the dream.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not after you wake up in one and become lucid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You go directly in, fully awake, then lay down and go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because when you go into a dream using SK mode, the perception isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s ghostlike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the old seers developed the twin positions technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s so obvious but we&amp;#39;re such idiots, no one understood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You lay in the position you want to use, in silent knowledge,  a dream will present itself to you,  and you zip into that one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or more like, &amp;quot;turn&amp;quot; into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been doing it over and over for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it will be ghostlike and transparent. Because you aren&amp;#39;t asleep!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very distracting!  You literally have to lay in the right position to try it, because you never actually go to sleep.  If you did it sitting up, you&amp;#39;d topple over and get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you lay down in SK, in a safe position, then when you go directly into the dream,which only takes a few seconds, you lay in the same position you are using in the waking world, and go to sleep inside the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You NEVER went to sleep in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only in the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_xe14bw", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/xe14bw/silent_knowledge/iogc3d9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1663192895.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1663192895.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 11}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iog3wdf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "rob_242", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iofkuxp", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_9hdwb3mm", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I know my experiences deviate from some here.

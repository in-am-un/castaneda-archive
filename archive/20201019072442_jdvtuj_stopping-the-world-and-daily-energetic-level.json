Like doing closed eye dreaming, or nothing but recapitulation.\n\nAny of those can let you make it all the way to meeting up with Carlos.\n\nBut without \"proof\" this community has twisted itself into a horrible mess, filled with angry men trying to gain power over people.  Complete frauds have taken over the \"teaching\" going on in this community, because there's no one doing real magic to expose their pretense.\n\nWe're plagued with angry men constantly in this subreddit. They come in her to brag, and tear down the real magic they can't do.\n\nSo I don't do this often, but here's how to stop the world.\n\nYou can do it yourself.  And while the procedure is the same, or can be for everyone, the results will be slightly different.  There are multiple places you can end up on stopping the world.  Even in Carlos' books.\n\nI'll just relate the one most expected by readers, as it happened to me.  But myself, I prefer re-runs.  Those can also occur.\n\nTo get there, you force silence until you begin to see colors.   Keep forcing it, until the air is filled with them.  I supposed you could do this closed eyed, but it's more likely to succeed if they are open\n\nYou silence your internal dialogue until you are literally in a \"fog\" of light.  Purple is my color these days but it leans pink when it gets intense.\n\nThen, try to find why it's so hard to keep silent.  Why you have to keep forcing yourself.  You go a minute, then you goof, then you have to use those \"silence muscles\" again.\n\nIt's tedious!  And why is it happening???\n\nYou'll find images in the mind. Mostly of conflicts you never got over.  Perhaps it's just a picture of the weird grin on someone's face as they did wrong to  you.\n\nThe picture summons words, the words create syntactic commands in the mind, and the assemblage point is yanked back to it's normal position.\n\nYou have to get rid of the images.  Also, it's very good to recap, so that if a latent image triggers some words, they don't link easily to more words (memories).  You got tired of that link, as a result of recap.\n\nBUT, if you're lazy like me, you can try it without doing the recap first.\n\nOnce you get rid of the images, and the words, the magic in the air (the fog) will start to crystalize.  Objects will be present.  Beings will show up. Places can be seen.\n\nYou can trigger them by scanning your \"gaze\", and being relentless in descerning any irregularities in the second attention fog.\n\nIt's so amazing, you'll probably be happy just to be there and forget your desire to stop the world.\n\nBut to stop the world, you have to go even further.\n\nYou have to stop recognizing the objects which crystalize in front of you.\n\nDon't interpret them at all.  Reject them as unimportant, without being angry at them.  They just don't matter.\n\nNothing matters.  It all just **is**, and there's nothing that needs to be done about it.\n\nYou'll begin to fall to the side once in a while, and almost slide off the pillows you are sitting on. Your body is completely asleep at this point, held up only because you're in a sleepwalking state.\n\nSo don't do this on the edge of the bed. Expect to fall over in a random direction.  Carlos also fell over, when he did it at UCLA.\n\nIf you have an inorganic being in the room, they may swoop past you from behind and tap you on the left shoulder.\n\nIt'll knock you into another world.\n\nTurn back, ignore it.  You can leave such an inorganic being manifested world just by turning your head to face back into your room.  All they really did was suggest you look that direction.  But it's still a choice.\n\nGo back to forcing silence, getting rid of images, and not caring about anything you experience.\n\nTime goes by. Who knows how much. You're so silent now, you don't notice time.  You drift in and out of something, but you don't know what.\n\nOne time you'll drift out, and  yellow will start to merge with the colors.  A horrible, sickly green gray yellow.\n\nThe sight of it only makes it brighter, until it's nearly blinding.\n\nThe world stops.\n\nTime passes. Who knows how much?\n\nYou find yourself feeling rather pleasant, look around, and you get a shock.\n\nBut the shock only sends a tingle through you, it doesn't disturb your mind.\n\nIt's like someone has you hooked up to electricity, such as the old fashioned hand shocker devices they had at Disneyland.\n\nThe current goes through you from bottom to top of head, but it's not unpleasant at all.\n\nBesides, you have no body.  Or at least if you do, you aren't noticing it.\n\nAnd your eyes have switched modes.  You are seeing energy as filaments.  The emanations!\n\nThey're everywhere!  It's like that scene in \"The Matrix\" movie, where Neo is blindfolded, and looking at nothing but energy.\n\nAlthough you're silent, you'll still have curiosity.\n\nA common thing to be curious about is, how dense are the emanations?\n\nIs it filled so densely that even a tiny fly couldn't move through there, without touching one?\n\nYou look and find, it's actually not that dense. There are passageways where the emanations are almost clear.\n\nYou travel into one of them, but without moving.  The whole thing sort of scrolls just because you were looking over there.\n\nSomething comes out to greet you. It's a bundle of emanations!\n\nIt looks like a sturdy, thick flame.  Maybe 3 feet wide, and 12 feet long, coming from somewhere deep in the endless forest of emanations.\n\nYou gaze at it, wondering if it's as hot as it looks.\n\nYour face is sucked into it, and you see another world.\n\nIt's a bundle of emanations, which represents that world!\n\nYou turn your head back, and you can still see both the flame, and the other emanations.\n\nYou turn back to look at that world.\n\nAnd then back again!\n\nCut it out.  Don't do that.  Either go in, or leave.\n\nYou can turn back and forth a couple of times, but I don't believe it's a good idea to keep it up.\n\nYou might burn from within.\n\nThat can happen when you don't want it to. Carlos had that problem at the end.  I suppose his body didn't want to live through the cancer until the very end, and decided it was time to leave.\n\nThe witches didn't want him to leave.\n\nSo he stuck around as long as he could.\n\nGood thing too. We're practicing what he decided to teach at the end,  knowing what he'd been doing wasn't going to work without him around.\n\nOddly, he saw that little blue dot we all see, but on his left big toe.\n\nOr at least, I seem to remember it was on the left toe.\n\nFancy showed me how to keep those dots around much longer, but she does most teaching at such a distant point that I can't recall it here.\n\nThe intense blue dot, normally the size of a pea, expanded as I watched it, until it was the size of a baseball.\n\nIt started to turn white in the center, and I expected something to emerge any second.\n\nBut I ran out of whatever energy allowed me to do that, and it faded away.\n\nIn Thailand they say, \"The blue pearl\" opens up to reveal your guru.\"\n\n(IOB?)", "edited": 1603136261.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g9cjfe7", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can stop the world on demand, given 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t do it, because it&amp;#39;s pointless for restoring balance to the Castaneda community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;selfish&amp;quot; pursuit I suppose.

She took it over, and always missed a spot at the edge. It was all dead there.\n\nSince I complained, the opposite is true.

She took it over, and always missed a spot at the edge. It was all dead there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I complained, the opposite is true. It&amp;#39;s all super watered, and the water bill jumped up $50 a month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I explained  to the neighbor about Cholita, and suggested she ought to avoid all contact.  She&amp;#39;s dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She  told me to be careful.

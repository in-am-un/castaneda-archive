This is not fear.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHe ordered me to sit down and relax. For a few minutes, there was complete silence.\r  \n\u201cYou want to keep your clearness, right? he said suddenly.\r  \n\u2013 Absolutely, Don Juan. It is quite right.\u201d He laughed with obvious pleasure.\r  \n\u201cThe clearness, the second enemy of the man of knowledge, has just appeared above you \u2026\r  \n\r  \n\u2013 You\u2019re not afraid, he said reassuringly, you\u2019re just amazed at the idea of losing your clearness, and as you do the moron, you take it for fear\u201d I was lying on the mat. Don Juan removed the pipe from my hands. My body became numb.\r  \n\u201cWhat will happen?\u201d I mouthed. I struggled to form my words. Don Juan laughed. He told me that I had to wait, eyes wide open, senses alert, and sooner or later I went to see the keeper.\r  \n\r  \nHe leaned toward me and in a breath he ordered me not to look at him, but to set a point on the mat with my left eye alone. I held the left eye on the point in question, but nothing happened. Suddenly I saw a mosquito come into my field of vision. He landed on the mat. I never turn my eye. Then he approached me, so close that my vision is blurred. Suddenly I felt that I stand on my feet in one leap.\r  \n\r  \nI was sure to observe the stage standing, at the usual height of my eyes, and what I saw shook me an irrepressible tremor. I was scared to death, and worse; how else to describe my panic at that moment? Just in front of me, very close, was a gigantic monster. A terrifying, excessive horror, a calamity I have never seen, not even in the worst scifi movies. I looked at the animal, dazed with stupor and blocked with terror.\r  \n\r  \nIts enormous size was the worst to bear, it was about thirty meters high. It looked like standing, though it seemed impossible that such a monster could stand. Then I saw that he had two wings, short and broad wings. I came to see more details. Its body was strewn with tufts of black hair, and he shook his long runny nose.\r  \n\r  \nHe had bulging eyes \u2013 two huge white balls. Flapping, he gained speed and began to spin around me. It glided with surprising speed and agility only a few inches over the soil. The monster looked unsightly, yet its speed and ease kept an admirable character.\r  \n\r  \nTwice it made a circle around me, vibrating its wings and projecting long streams of saliva in all directions. Then it walked away with incredible speed and disappeared in the distance.\r  \n\r  \nAn intense feeling of heaviness came over me, I could not think or move, I was stuck in place. Suddenly I saw a distant cloud and a moment later, the huge beast turned around me at high speed. Its wings passed increasingly close my eyes, suddenly one of them struck me violently, and I collapsed with a cry of pain and despair. \r  \n\r  \nWhen Castaneda recovers, he is lying at the bottom of a shallow stream, while Don Juan carefully sprinkled him with water to reconstitute his body wrapping battered by astral travel. Then he slept twelve hours or more. When waking up, his mind has taken over:\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d \r  \n\r  \nDon Juan laughs softly. \u201cYou went to seek the keeper and of course you found it.\r  \n\u2013 Say, Don Juan, what was it?\r  \n\u2013 It is the guadian, the porter, the sentinel of the other world\u201d he replied in a perfectly neutral tone.\r  \n\r  \nNaturally Castaneda get upset, he wants to describe to Don Juan the horrible monster who so cruelly wounded him. He blamed his benefactor to have thrown him into the clutches of such an horror.\r  \n\r  \nWhich doubles Juan Matus\u2019 laugh. \r  \n\u201cThe guardian of the other world is only a cousin, he said quietly. \r  \n\u2013 What?!\r  \n\u2013 The guardian of the other world is a cousin, that you met yesterday was a cousin, and that cousin will push you until you overcome\u201d", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ha1jlhr", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What happened out there, don Juan?&amp;quot; I finally asked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You had an appointment with knowledge,&amp;quot; he said, pointing with a movement of his chin to &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the dark edge of the desert chaparral. &amp;quot;I took you there because I caught a glimpse of knowledge \n prowling around the house earlier. You might say that knowledge knew that you were coming \n and was waiting for you. Rather than meeting it here, I felt it was proper to meet it on a power \n spot. Then I set up a test to see if you had enough personal power to isolate it from the rest of the \n things around us. You did fine.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait a minute!&amp;quot; I protested. &amp;quot;I saw the silhouette of a man hiding behind a bush and then I &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;saw a huge bird.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You didn&amp;#39;t see a man!&amp;quot; he said emphatically. &amp;quot;Neither did you see a bird.

About 3 PM, I was a little hungry, several times I suggested we eat a piece, but Don Juan refused. He handed me his pipe stuffed with his smoking mixture. I was suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSoon will come the guardian of the other world. You have nothing to do but watch it. Check how it moves, and all it will do.

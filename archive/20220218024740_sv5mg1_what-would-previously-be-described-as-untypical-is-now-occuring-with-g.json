To me, I feel there is an intrinsic relationship between consistentcy and the depth of our results of the mastery of intent. \n\nMy practice in sorcery, utilizing the methods provided - recapitulation, tensegrity, stalking and darkroom work has provided me with a sensation of reclaiming possession of my soul, arriving at the moment where I feel it ran off requires further recapitulation, but for now  I've noticed an influx in the drawing back of energy into the energy body from having disengaged the connection of energy with memory through recapitulation, this has proven especially true with traumatic memories which left energetic scars. \n\nI'm thinking this new shift in energy is manifesting events to transpire which would be considered untypical in \"normal states of reality\" \n\nFor instance : This morning I go outside and the cover that goes over the fire pit on my deck is absolutely eviscerated having had around 70% of the tarp shredded into ribbons and the remaining material very intricately cut out in almost a deliberate artistic manner.

I was wheeled into another room where I lay looking up at the ceiling before my surgery when I started to see three blue birds made out of energy flying around me in a circular pattern, when I seen them I knew I would be fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t exactly new to me in the full sense of the world, but I did stop practicing for many years, really because I thought I was going to have a mental breakdown which I found out when studying that Carlos had experienced the same thing. Not too long ago, I stumbled upon the subreddit when I was searching something very specific on Google and there was a thread on this subreddit involving that subject. Hence, I found myself reading  and studying the literary works of Carlos and his experience with Don Juan which transported me back to exactly what I ran away from years ago and I looked at the path that appeared and  chose to go down it once again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That about sums it up as far as the turning points go, there were more experiences, and I could go on and on, but I&amp;#39;m not trying to write a book.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_sv5mg1", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/sv5mg1/what_would_previously_be_described_as_untypical/hxixe2y/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1645234958.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 7, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hxipgdo", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hxhj4wf", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Multiple people are incredulous about your casual account in this comment.

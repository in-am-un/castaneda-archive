And they're using a different user idea elsewhere, to hide their activities.\n\nIt's not always true, but more often than not.\n\nBut the next rule of bad players is the most important.\n\nOn coming here, they don't have the correct reaction of someone who's been wanting to learn sorcery for real.\n\nThe correct reaction is, \"Holy Shit!!! You mean this shit actually works, and I wasn't delusional all these years???  How do I get started?\"\n\nThere's only one other correct reaction. If you think about it carefully, you'll realize this has to be true.  There is no other place teaching or describing real sorcery.\n\nSo it's not like they've gotten used to the real thing somewhere else.  And if they were somehow super sorcerers themselves, they wouldn't ignore the fact that this is the only place teaching the real thing.  They'd have something to say about why they let everyone be stupid for the last 23 years, and vow to help from here out.\n\nSo the only other reaction that's valid (honest) is, \"You guys are pulling my leg!\"\n\nBut this guy just ignored it, and started posting.\n\nThat's another of the bad player signs.  They post right away, and often.\n\nThey're desperate for attention.\n\nMore exotic signs of bad players are:\n\nWarning people of dangers (as a substitute for not understanding anything at all).\n\nTrying to sell something or convince you another guru has \"insight\" we need to listen to.\n\nTrying to create intellectual problems (as he does in this post), which are irrelevant once you realize, there are finally real sorcerers in the community and they're all in here ready to help you out.\n\nThere's no understanding of sorcery at all in their posts.

We had one last week.\n\nIt was like a forking \"job interview\".\n\nI just watched \"The Good Place\" on streaming media.  It seems you can't swear in heaven, so if you say fuc?ing, it comes out \"forking\".\n\nGood idea!\n\nThough Carlos had a very foul mouth, and relished it.  As don Juan also did.\n\nWe perhaps just can't afford that luxury, with internet censorship being so popular these days.  I even run into people in our very own community, advocating censoring what others can look at.\n\nThe man who came to the subreddit to steal attention, claimed he could see this cool thing, and that cool thing,  and he was silent all the time.\n\nSounded wonderful until he insisted he was going to learn the way he wanted, and it didn't need to have anything to do with following the instructions Carlos actually gave us.\n\nWrong!!!\n\nThat's so wrong, I don't know where to begin.\n\nThe man had fallen prey to thinking this is all about sitting in the dark, \"looking for your greatness\".\n\nIt's not even slightly about that!\n\nThe pictures give that impression to people with bad motivations.\n\nBut actually what we're doing in here, is learning about \"intent\".\n\nHow to clean our link to it.\n\nBut even more importantly, how to hook ourselves to \"The intent of the Sorcerers of Ancient Mexico\".\n\nCarlos kept repeating that in his writings and in lectures at the end.\n\nI used to wonder why the heck such a long description?   And why repeat it so often?\n\nBut now I understand.\n\nThere's NO SORCERY without the old seers.\n\nAnd so our visiting pretend wizard, was totally clueless.\n\nMeaning, he can't do what he says at all.\n\nAt least, not sober.  Unless he's schizophrenic.  In which case he'll say he can, and believe it, but actually can't at all.\n\nSchizophrenia causes you to SAY crazy things.  Not necessarily to experience them for real.\n\nIt's short circuits in the brain, horizontally.  So one idea, produces a wrong association elsewhere.\n\nReal sorcery is the opposite.  You actually DO see crazy things. But you aren't particularly inclined to talk about them, because of how quickly our society punishes you for going outside the allowed range of perception.\n\nIt's the chicken coop story Carlos told.  Making an analogy to our situation, as a society.\n\nOne chicken tries to escape the coop, the others peck it to death.\n\nBut the fact remains, you can't fake sorcery!\n\nIt's not about \"looking for your greatness\" by finding druglike visions.\n\nThat's show business, not sorcery.\n\nLet's talk about the \"Evil Clown Effect\".\n\nYou can cross reference it with this story from don Juan:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"The old seers were not just talking about faith,\" he said. \"Although they were not as practical as the new seers, they were practical enough to know what they were seeing.\n\n\"What I was trying to point out to you with that question, which has rattled you so badly, is that our rationality alone cannot come up with an answer about the reason for our existence. Every time it tries, the answer turns into a matter of beliefs. The old seers took another road, and they did find an answer which doesn't involve faith alone.\"\n\nHe said that the old seers, risking untold dangers, actually saw the indescribable force which is the source of all sentient beings. They called it the Eagle because in the few glimpses that they could sustain, they saw it as something that resembled a black-and-white eagle of infinite size.\n\nThey saw that it is the Eagle who bestows awareness. The Eagle creates sentient beings so that they will live and enrich the awareness it gives them with life. They also saw that it is the Eagle who devours that same enriched awareness after making sentient beings relinquish it at the moment of death.\n\n\"For the old seers,\" don Juan went on, \"to say that the reason for existence is to enhance awareness is not a matter of faith or deduction. They saw it.\n\n\"They saw that the awareness of sentient beings flies away at the moment of death and floats like a luminous cotton puff right into the Eagle's beak to be consumed. For the old seers that was the evidence that sentient beings live only to enrich the awareness that is the Eagle's food.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI asked him if the source of the emanations was called the Eagle because eagles in general have important attributes.\n\n\"This is simply the case of something unknowable vaguely resembling something known,\" he replied. \"On account of that, there have certainly been attempts to imbue eagles with attributes they don't have. But that always happens when impressionable people learn to perform acts that require great sobriety. Seers come in all sizes and shapes.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that there are different kinds of seers?\"\n\n\"No. I mean that there are scores of imbeciles who become seers. Seers are human beings full of foibles, or rather, human beings full of foibles are capable of becoming seers. Just as in the case of miserable people who become superb scientists.\n\n\"The characteristic of miserable seers is that they are willing to forget the wonder of the world. They become overwhelmed by the fact that they see and believe that it's their genius that counts. A seer must be a paragon in order to override the nearly invincible laxness of our human condition. More important than seeing itself is what seers do with what they see.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that, don Juan?\"\n\n\"Look at what some seers have done to us. We are stuck with their vision of an Eagle that rules us and devours us at the moment of our death.\"\n\nHe said that there is a definite laxness in that version, and that personally he did not appreciate the idea of something devouring us. For him, it would be more accurate to say that there is a force that attracts our consciousness, much as a magnet attracts iron shavings. At the moment of dying, all of our being disintegrates under the attraction of that immense force.\n\nThat such an event was interpreted as the Eagle devouring us he found grotesque, because it turns an indescribable act into something as mundane as eating.\n\n\"I'm a very average man,\" I said. \"The description of an Eagle that devours us had a great impact on me.\"\n\n\"The real impact can't be measured until the moment when you see it yourself,\" he said. \"But you must bear in mind that our flaws remain with us even after we become seers. So when you see that force, you may very well agree with the lax seers who called it the Eagle, as I did myself. On the other hand, you may not. You may resist the temptation to ascribe human attributes to what is incomprehensible, and actually improvise a new name for it; a more accurate one.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo back to the \"Evil Clown Effect\".\n\nIf you warn a beginner that their first view of an inorganic being during darkroom practice might look like an Evil Clown, you have increased the chance they'll see that, 100 fold.\n\nOver them never having heard that.\n\nThe inorganic beings love to project images at us, and usually they find something inside us which produces the reaction of fear.\n\nThey love the energy of fear so much, the old seers used to scare their enemies to death, using their allies.\n\nI'm not sure what the old seers got out of that, other than revenge.\n\nBut we know our own \"death defier\" can absorb energy from other humans if he cracks open their luminous egg a bit. So if the allies scare someone to death, their shell will in fact completely break.  And maybe the old seers themselves, could feast on the results.\n\nWhich might give us a hint on how \"the death defier\" learned to do what he does.\n\nAnd so when people first start to perceive inorganic beings, it's like a wrestling match.\n\nThey try to scare you, you have to overcome that.\n\nAfterwards, they'll take any form you can \"intend\" them to take.\n\nAt first, just ask!\n\nAnd keep in mind, there are \"intent\" delays. And also, it can take some practice.\n\nI turned my Ally \"Fairy\" into a Siberian Cat back a few years ago.\n\nTook at least a week to get a perfect cat. When she had it down she jumped up on the bed and it actually bounced a bit.\n\nSo sorcery is subject to \"contamination\" and manipulation by what you \"expect\" to see.\n\nBut who cares????\n\nNo one can do what we do.\n\nSo let them study their sacred scrolls and find reasons to complain about us.\n\nWon't do them any good. There's the internet now, and streaming media.\n\nAn experienced darkroomer will look at that animation and know PRECISELY why I'm concerned.\n\nThey may even feel their own selves being contaminated by the sight of it.\n\nIt's using the PopcornFX special effects from Library 40.\n\nApparently that's \"a thing\" in the animation world.  ChatGPT knew a whole bunch about it.\n\nI plan to use it to make a \"puff\".  It's just not possible to make one without some \"particle physics\" going on in the software.\n\nI could project a video of a good view of a \"puff\" onto a transparent surface in the animation scenes, and use that when I need puffs in the cartoons.\n\nBut I would still have to get hold of a video.\n\nAnd I doubt anyone has ever made one that's accurate, since no one has seen the puffs in the past.\n\nExcept once in a while by accident in the middle of the night.\n\nMyself, I've gazed at them for hundreds of hours.\n\nJust last night for at least 30 minutes, trying to get an idea how to portray it the next day.\n\nYet I still couldn't accurately describe them.\n\nOnce you believe you know what they look like, you just altered it.\n\nIn fact you can grab one with both hands, stretch it out like it was taffy, then flip the flat surface into the air and construct a freeway overpass high above you.\n\nWe're playing with \"intent\" here, not with our own \"greatness\".\n\n\"Looking for your greatness\" in the dark, is a mistaken understanding of what sorcery is in the first place.\n\nIt's all about intent flowing into the emanations, and re skimming reality.\n\nAnd realizing there's nowhere to go, unless you follow the path left by the old seers.\n\nI believe I'll make my puffs in 4 versions like I did for the IOB pink puffs, and see which one looks right to everyone.\n\nBut be warned.\n\nThe cartoons will alter what people perceive.\n\nJust as those old seers stuck us with that awful Shamanic \"Eagle\" nonsense.\n\nI hate that screeching eagle in Walker, Texas Ranger.\n\nIt's cheap pretend shamanism.\n\n\"Animal Totems\" and such nonsense designed to pacify people who don't have any real magic they can explore.\n\nSo they explore fantasies in the river of shit.\n\nThose are the kind of people who attacked Carlos from the same year his first book was available,  and tried to destroy him with lies.\n\nSuch as \"cultural appropriation\".\n\nWhat culture???  Show me!\n\nBut they'd better not be obsessed with screeching eagles, or sticking their feathers in things.\n\nThat's fake magic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Altering What's Perceived Unintentionally?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Audiovisual"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 82, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"1knlge2xn7ya1": {"status": "valid", "e": "RedditVideo", "dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/139mn0o/asset/1knlge2xn7ya1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1718050777%2CNzc0MzJiMWZhMGUwNmE1ZmM4MzFhNWUwZTFhZjdmNTRiNDY3YjRlMTA1M2FmOWVjOGFkNTI0NDA4ZjAzYzA1YQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "x": 616, "y": 360, "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/139mn0o/asset/1knlge2xn7ya1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1718050777%2CNWQ5NmUyN2QwZDQ0ZDIxNThiYTZjYzE4YWFmZmZiNGEwMzIzMDYzZGNkMTg1NWY0MGYwZGRlYWYwYmM2NjUyYw%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "1knlge2xn7ya1", "isGif": false}}, "name": "t3_139mn0o", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Audiovisual", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Bw7wWFHG9G_XP-QA1I8v_OtwjkE5wHvIxItBFodPF4A.jpg", "edited": 1683382367.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1683378770.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/139mn0o/video/1knlge2xn7ya1/player\"&gt;https://reddit.com/link/139mn0o/video/1knlge2xn7ya1/player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, keep in mind that for the last 57 years, NO ONE in the Castaneda fan base saw anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not a single person learned any actual sorcery, meaning how to move their assemblage point on demand, sober, eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So whatever damage cartoons might do, it&amp;#39;s nothing compared to losing it all to greedy pretenders writing fake sorcery books, or traveling around pretending to be &amp;quot;Naguals&amp;quot; so they can steal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some might take exception with the claim no one learned anything, but if someone did, how come they didn&amp;#39;t come out to restore the reputation of Carlos?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we got stuck with that job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if there&amp;#39;s some &amp;quot;wizard&amp;quot; saint out there, shame on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally the ones who believe they are come here.

It&amp;#39;s just not possible to make one without some &amp;quot;particle physics&amp;quot; going on in the software.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could project a video of a good view of a &amp;quot;puff&amp;quot; onto a transparent surface in the animation scenes, and use that when I need puffs in the cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I would still have to get hold of a video.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I doubt anyone has ever made one that&amp;#39;s accurate, since no one has seen the puffs in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except once in a while by accident in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myself, I&amp;#39;ve gazed at them for hundreds of hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just last night for at least 30 minutes, trying to get an idea how to portray it the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet I still couldn&amp;#39;t accurately describe them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you believe you know what they look like, you just altered it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact you can grab one with both hands, stretch it out like it was taffy, then flip the flat surface into the air and construct a freeway overpass high above you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re playing with &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; here, not with our own &amp;quot;greatness&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Looking for your greatness&amp;quot; in the dark, is a mistaken understanding of what sorcery is in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all about intent flowing into the emanations, and re skimming reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And realizing there&amp;#39;s nowhere to go, unless you follow the path left by the old seers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe I&amp;#39;ll make my puffs in 4 versions like I did for the IOB pink puffs, and see which one looks right to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But be warned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cartoons will alter what people perceive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as those old seers stuck us with that awful Shamanic &amp;quot;Eagle&amp;quot; nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate that screeching eagle in Walker, Texas Ranger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s cheap pretend shamanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Animal Totems&amp;quot; and such nonsense designed to pacify people who don&amp;#39;t have any real magic they can explore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they explore fantasies in the river of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are the kind of people who attacked Carlos from the same year his first book was available,  and tried to destroy him with lies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such as &amp;quot;cultural appropriation&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What culture???  Show me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;d better not be obsessed with screeching eagles, or sticking their feathers in things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s fake magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false,

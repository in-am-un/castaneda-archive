After his father's death, eight-year-old Prem Rawat became the new \"[Satguru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satguru)\" (True Master). At age 13 Prem Rawat traveled to the West, soon taking up residence in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).  Many young adults took interest in the claim that Prem Rawat could  impart direct knowledge of God to his followers, and some have said to  have experienced it. Many news media were perplexed by his youth and  claims of divine status, and he was criticized for a lack of  intellectual content in his public discourses,[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prem_Rawat#cite_note-MeltonDLM-3)[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prem_Rawat#cite_note-Schnabel1982-4) and for leading an opulent lifestyle.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prem_Rawat#cite_note-R&amp;R1980-5)[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prem_Rawat#cite_note-Hunt-6) At the same time, internally the movement made a point of focusing on non-intellectual domains of spiritual practice.  [*Time*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine))  magazine reported that many Indian spiritual teachers were critical of  him for starting followers with methods that were too advanced.  Tens of  thousands were initiated in Knowledge techniques, and hundreds of DLM  centers opened worldwide. Some Western followers took up communal life  in dozens of [ashrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashram), guided by DLM [Mahatmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah%C4%81tm%C4%81). \n\nIn November 1973, the [Millennium '73](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_%2773) festival was held in the [Houston Astrodome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrodome),  and although this was near the height of Prem Rawat's media fame,  attendance was far lower than expected. When he turned 16, Prem Rawat  became [emancipated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_of_minors) and got married. He cut ties to his mother and [eldest brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satpal_Maharaj),  and with the original Indian DLM organization. He retained control of  the DLM everywhere else (at this point it was established in 55  countries). \n\nIn the early 1980s, he began to discard direct references to  religion in his speeches and closed the ashrams. The name of the DLM was  changed to [Elan Vital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elan_Vital_(organization)).

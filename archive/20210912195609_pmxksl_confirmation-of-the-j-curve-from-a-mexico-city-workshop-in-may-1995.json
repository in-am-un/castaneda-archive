Roaming free in the dark sea of awareness, we collided with the  *intent* of this world and took a birth.\n\nBut half of our energy refused to be trapped here, and went off to roam freely.\n\nWe can get that to come back and visit in the darkroom.  When you reach orange and hold it long enough that you know it's stable, keep practicing until you feel you are almost out of energy, and then just lie down.  Put your body to rest, but keep the eyes open.\n\nIt's what Zuleica had Taisha do in the tree house, to get her double to come out.  She lay on her side, and visualized doing kungfu on the ground.  \n\nPutting your body to rest while still in the orange, you'll begin to find that port of energy don Juan talks about.  \n\nYou'll notice it, don't worry!  Won't be able to describe it.  But it will be extremely pleasant to feel.\n\nAnd then you'll switch over to the double, going directly from waking into dreaming.\n\nBut  you'll be in a \"real\" place, according to don Juan.  He said that any dreaming which starts from silence is \"real\".\n\nAnd since you never went to sleep, and your eyes were open, it's hard to mistake it for a dream.  If you just remember how you entered. Once in side, it can become very dreamlike, although you retain lucidity with no effort.\n\nAnd, the double can also come into the physical room.  \n\nIn my case, Cholita's often waiting on the other side, so I tend to go that direction.\n\nI believe this explains why Taisha said the second attention energy body, the one we \"rebuild\" with tensegrity, is the dreaming double.\n\nWhereas I can't recall any places in the books of Carlos, which even imply that.\n\nMaybe it's just a matter of us having energy in common with the double inside us. And that the two of  them can come together a little more smoothly than by using the Silent Knowledge method to find the double.\n\nSilent Knowledge is purple zone stuff.  While there you can \"find\" the double.  It's out there!  You'll get a little pull of energy from out there, turn your head to look that direction, and a vision of the double running around somewhere, will materialize where you looked.  But remember, you're in silent knowledge.  So you \"don't care\".\n\nIt's kind of a cheat!  After all that work a little window to infinity opens up, and you can see your own double out there.  And you can sense, he noticed you but was too busy to show it. \n\nBut instead of jumping up with joy, you don't care.\n\nNo big deal. Oh, so that's him?  What's all the fuss???\n\nIt's like cake, without the cakey goodness.\n\nAnd if you are doing something interesting after you find him in the purple zone, he'll  come sit on the edge of the bed with you.\n\nLook... the guy has nothing better to do.  He's lost any sense of purpose.  It's not that the isn't intelligent.  He is!  \n\nBut he's like your cousin who never pays rent, never works a job, and is always out getting stoned in the mountains.\n\nIf you have something interesting going on, he'll visit.  But don't expect him to have the same sense of purpose (strife) that you have.\n\nSince you can glance down and see your second attention energy body while in Silent Knowledge,  while you are looking for the double, you can say that your energy body is \"here\".\n\nBut when you locate your double running around out there, he's \"there\".\n\nAnd when the double comes to sit on the bed, he's REALLY \"there\"!\n\nYou find the \"abstract\" between the two.\n\nAnd in that state, it seems for sure that the double is not the same as the energy body.\n\nAt least, to me it seems that way.\n\nBut, if you start from the orange zone as I described before, the merging seems to start inside you, noticing the double's energy, and then you \"leave\" your body to go into dreaming, so it seems as if the double were inside you.\n\nBut not entirely. If you use the orange zone method, you will feel something inside you, which causes you to discover the same thing outside you.\n\nAt this point it all becomes very abstract, and you might indeed notice the external portion of the double as a \"thing\".\n\nA flat tan object pressing towards you.  Or a complex piece of machine made out of red goo, oozing around, blocking you from moving on in the darkness. But giving you a sense of total well being as long as you pay attention to it.  Mixed with a sense of pressure, which is almost uncomfortable.\n\nBut that won't last.  It's a beginners thing to see it that way, until you realize what's going to happen, and stop making dividing lines like that.\n\nWill everyone see something such as I just described?\n\nWe just don't know. But if anyone can see it differently, it won't matter what they saw!\n\nThe main thing is to be doing it for real.

What&amp;#39;s all the fuss???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like cake, without the cakey goodness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you are doing something interesting after you find him in the purple zone, he&amp;#39;ll  come sit on the edge of the bed with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look... the guy has nothing better to do.  He&amp;#39;s lost any sense of purpose.  It&amp;#39;s not that the isn&amp;#39;t intelligent.  He is!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he&amp;#39;s like your cousin who never pays rent, never works a job, and is always out getting stoned in the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have something interesting going on, he&amp;#39;ll visit.  But don&amp;#39;t expect him to have the same sense of purpose (strife) that you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since you can glance down and see your second attention energy body while in Silent Knowledge,  while you are looking for the double, you can say that your energy body is &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you locate your double running around out there, he&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when the double comes to sit on the bed, he&amp;#39;s REALLY &amp;quot;there&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You find the &amp;quot;abstract&amp;quot; between the two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in that state, it seems for sure that the double is not the same as the energy body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, to me it seems that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, if you start from the orange zone as I described before, the merging seems to start inside you, noticing the double&amp;#39;s energy, and then you &amp;quot;leave&amp;quot; your body to go into dreaming, so it seems as if the double were inside you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not entirely. If you use the orange zone method, you will feel something inside you, which causes you to discover the same thing outside you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point it all becomes very abstract, and you might indeed notice the external portion of the double as a &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A flat tan object pressing towards you.  Or a complex piece of machine made out of red goo, oozing around, blocking you from moving on in the darkness. But giving you a sense of total well being as long as you pay attention to it.  Mixed with a sense of pressure, which is almost uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that won&amp;#39;t last.  It&amp;#39;s a beginners thing to see it that way, until you realize what&amp;#39;s going to happen, and stop making dividing lines like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will everyone see something such as I just described?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just don&amp;#39;t know. But if anyone can see it differently, it won&amp;#39;t matter what they saw!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main thing is to be doing it for real.

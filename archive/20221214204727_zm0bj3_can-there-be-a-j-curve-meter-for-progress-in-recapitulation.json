Just like Zuleica warned Taisha could happen.\n\nHowever, the assemblage point takes 2 hours to move from blue to orange.\n\nIt doesn't move faster just because you're doing recap!\n\nSo if you only do 30 minutes a day, you're screwed.\n\nI suppose you might make it down to the green line that way.\n\nBut look at all the good that does people who practice meditation.\n\nTheir heads explode if they look in this subreddit, and they start shouting \"You Lie Sir!\"\n\nA favorite refrain of \"Zen Masters\". Denying reality in order to protect their status.\n\nDon't modify the breath.\n\nSweep all the way, inhale slowly going left while visualizing taking back the strands of energy that got stuck in the world by your feelings, and exhale slowly going right, to eject the ones others stuck in you.\n\nThat won't be visible at first, but later on it WILL be. Fully visible!\n\nDo a full head turn, without straining.\n\n6-10 seconds for each direction.\n\nSo 12-20 for a \"full cycle\".\n\nThere's people making all sorts of weird recommendations for how to sweep the head, even saying you can just sweep it a fraction of an inch.\n\nTrying to be teachers, before they learned. \n\nHanskey pulled some of that before he went mad and started sexually harassing women.\n\nBut none of those people who discuss alternative ways to sweep, can make magic  happen. They just accumulated \"factoids\" and wanted to get some attention by using them.\n\nSome of the witches in here might have heard modifications from Taisha or Florinda.\n\nWhich is fine.  \n\nBut I prefer the full sweep, because of the \"blank outs\".\n\nAnd I'd rather sweep left during the inhale, in order to inhale from the \"magical direction\".\n\nExhale out the crap, into the red zone direction. Where crap is actually kind of beautiful.\n\nThe \"no sweep\" is super advance, and only works if your assemblage point is at least deep orange zone.\n\nBefore then, it's just nasty attention seeking pretending.\n\nThe big sweep is good to figure out precisely when you \"blank out\".\n\nIf you blank out in the middle of a sweep, after doing it 1 hour or more, forget what you were doing and have to \"resume\" a sweep,  after an unknown pause, then when you blank out at least 3 times total just trying to finish the same sweep, you are doing it right.\n\nThe IOB realm will materialize for you to look inside.  But not if you remember that I told you that.\n\nIf you stop breathing during the blank out, don't worry about it.\n\nUnless you've been pooping fentanyl or opioids.\n\nYour body knows it has to resume breathing.\n\nI have no idea what's going on with Cleargreen.\n\nCould be, Carol Tiggs has told them to keep their mouth shut.\n\nThat they can't take anyone else along with them.\n\nOr Carlos insisted they \"change nothing\" because he had secret things going on in the background.\n\nOr, \"They lie Sir!\"\n\nAnd aren't actually practicing much because they don't believe it anymore.\n\nMaybe some of our witches can go find out one day. What's going on in the other factions that makes them seem to be so lame.\n\nThey would have let the whole thing die, and still are unlikely to admit that.

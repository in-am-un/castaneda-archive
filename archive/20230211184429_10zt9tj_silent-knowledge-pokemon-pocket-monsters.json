And is it really worth it?\n\nThere's 1 million cool magical things you can learn to do.  And that's only limited by our short lifespan.\n\nThe Allies of course try to lure you to come live in their world for 5 million years.  Because their world is \"sealed\" your luminous egg container can last that much longer, allowing you to go on living.\n\nNo old seer who went there, even from 10,000 years ago, has ever died.  All are still there, learning even more.\n\nAs their lure, the inorganic beings promise to teach you endless magic if you'll go live with them.\n\nBut in fact, it's probably a trick.\n\nThey probably only help you do what you see here. And can do on your own.  Manipulate the emanations yourself, directly.\n\nYou can learn limitless magic without outside help!  That's what silent knowledge is for.\n\nWell... Mostly that's true.  \n\nWe still need to borrow some of the inorganic being's \"dark energy\" from time to time.  The old seers never found another source.\n\nBut we can pay them back for that with friendship, and then we have no further obligations to their world.\n\nNow, understand that some of those old \"Men of Knowledge\" rituals you read about in the books, such as the talking lizards, were obviously what we now call \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nOr even the moth dust ritual that shows images of people you ask for, as mushroom shapes. And you just \"know\" what all the bumps and twists say about the person.\n\nBOTH are merely silent knowledge.  Brought to you \"early\" by the inorganic beings, so you can skip most of the hard work of learning to be silent.\n\nThe Men of Knowledge were inept.  Profiteers, not interested in magic as much as food and goods.\n\nThose gave rise to all Mesoamerican shamanism.   Except that along the way, both the correct rituals and the Allies who made them work, were lost. Shamanism now tries to rely almost entirely on the drugs. And accepts random drug highs as \"meaningful\".  \n\nDrugs we never touch,  except perhaps at rock concerts if you have a hot date.\n\nThat kind of magic is just the shadow of the kind of magic the old seers did.  \n\nThe old seers were NOT \"Men of Knowledge\".  Our community gets confused on that point.\n\nAnthropologist Michael Harner, an old friend of Carlos,  said Carlos didn't steal anything from native americans. Because what they have is shamanism. \n\nThe speciality of Michael.\n\nBut Carlos was doing sorcery.  And Michael even got invited to go meet don Juan, before anyone knew who that was.\n\nSorcery and shamanism are NOT the same thing, or Native American Shamanism wouldn't be so darned boring.\n\nThis post doesn't show anything new, in terms of our magic.\n\nBut it sure felt like that last night.\n\nIt's just another Silent Knowledge presentation method.\n\nA little \"fun\" entity.\n\nHis \"knowledge\" was how to make him appear using your fingers, wiggled on the whitish light Carlos told us about.\n\nKeep in mind, that is NOT an inorganic being.\n\nIn my opinion, Mescalito was like that creature.

And official native shamaness at Morongo reservation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A gnat flew into her cheek.  That&amp;#39;s how she became a witch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what happened from what I witnessed, is that young men in the tribes read the books of Carlos, and started trying to copy it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Claiming it was &amp;quot;theirs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ruby&amp;#39;s friend John, younger I suspect, tried to do the Devil&amp;#39;s Weed ritual going down a &amp;quot;full yard&amp;quot;. Or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no way his tribe had that devil&amp;#39;s weed ceremony from the books of Carlos! They always just made tea from the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;John was just trying to duplicate the books of Carlos.  As were many young native americans in the tribes of the west.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos &amp;quot;contaminated&amp;quot; them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They found a market in delusional hippies, and the stuff from the books of Carlos sort of &amp;quot;mutated&amp;quot; into their traditional shamanism because it was profitable to pretend they had it all along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So essentially THEY stole from Carlos. Not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as don Juan said, they all try to copy the old ways but none of them has any actual understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan effectively said, none of the shamans out there had real magic going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if there are, they aren&amp;#39;t visible on the web so they don&amp;#39;t do any of us any

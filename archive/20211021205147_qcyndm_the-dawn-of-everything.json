And Olmec.\n\nAnd then researching, finding that the Olmecs had large 5000 year old cities which have been excavated, but the statues and figurines had ethnic qualities different from surrounding populations of Clovis Mesoamerican ancestors.\n\nThe caves along the east coast of Mexico, also the location of their largest cities, had the remains of people going back as far as 30,000 years ago.\n\nTurns out, in addition to that land mass crossing Clovis people, there was a Siberian ship crash landed in the Americas 13,000 years ago.  And that's a recent find.\n\nThere's bound to be more.\n\nThe Siberians had a form of shamanism people often compare to Castaneda's works.  To Olmec shamanism.\n\nI arrived at the theory that agriculture destroyed magic because it created the idea that children must stick with a nuclear family (for free farm labor). They didn't help anyone by wandering around like their ancestors.\n\nOnce stuck in a farm situation, the women exerted more control over the men.  Without the knowledge they had from their fishing and gatherings, which included container making, non-meat food sourcing (seeds, berries) and  use of plants as medicine, the women lost much of their \"worth\".\n\nWhen they got old, they needed rules to force others to protect them.\n\nTo \"keep granny from having to eat cat food\".\n\nBefore agriculture, the worth of women was enormous.  They formed associations with other women, and shared knowledge coveted by the younger people.  They didn't need any strength advantage to flourish in that form of sociaty.\n\nAfter agriculture they became \"expendable\",  and so they created social rules designed to control the men.\n\nSurplus food lead to people who didn't even create their own, living in cities,  with even less connection to the land.  People spent their lives in \"rooms\".\n\nThat created depression, fear of death, fear of darkness, and all the things that make humans gullible, and subject to con artist religious figures.\n\nThe large cities gave rise to money and book deals (religious con artists).\n\nInstead of roaming the wilds, in search of magic and understanding, \"magic\" because something you have in agreement by other humans, and not because you can actually teach it to someone else.\n\nYou just need to bully others into saying you have it.\n\nAnd obsessed with that view of magic the \"seekers\" lost all interest, and instead sought attention from other people. To \"pretend\" their magic.\n\nI get that sort of person attacking my social media constantly.\n\nNo one cares about the real thing anymore.  Probably, people have even stopped actually believing in it.\n\nWe're in the dark ages created by endless bad players. Like the Jewish Prophets,  the Buddha, Lao Tsu, and famous petty tyrant gurus like the Dali Lama,  Yogananda and Maharishi.\n\nAnd certainly anyone ought to notice, there actually is no real magic in any other modern system.\n\nIt's there for anyone to see now, on the internet!\n\nBig claims, false promises, lame excuses, and misdirected attention.\n\nAngry \"monks\", but no magic...\n\nNever before in all of history could you figure out you were being tricked, so easily.\n\nJust look around for god's sake!\n\nBut no one does.  Along with no magic, we got the gift of \"ME\".  The ME position of the assemblage point, universal to modern man.\n\nI figure that comes from being trapped in rooms, in cities, not going out to hunt or gather, and becoming obsessed with your status among people.  And from the additional social rules the women created, to protect themselves in old age.\n\nInstead of being obsessed with learning about the environment and spirits, we got declawed and turned stupid.  To long for nothing but human approval.\n\nBut, there IS magic in the very oldest stuff.   Starting from 6000 years ago and further back.\n\nYou can see it by reading their accounts of things like demons, and \"heavenly realms\".\n\nYou notice a pattern, and realize it's corrupted accounts of what we see using Olmec sorcery, every single day in our darkroom gazing practices.\n\nOnce you have real food in front of you, the wax stuff can't fool you anymore!\n\n\\*\\*\\* blurbs from the click bait at [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/graeber-wengrow-dawn-of-everything-history-humanity/620177/?utm\\_source=pocket-newtab](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/graeber-wengrow-dawn-of-everything-history-humanity/620177/?utm_source=pocket-newtab) \\*\\*\\*\n\nOnce upon a time, human beings lived in small, egalitarian bands of hunter-gatherers  (the so-called state of nature).

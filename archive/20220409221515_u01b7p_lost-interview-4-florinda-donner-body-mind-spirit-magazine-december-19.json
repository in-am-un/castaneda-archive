Through his writing, Castaneda introduced the Baby Boom generation to a world of vast mystery accessed through a tradition unlike any other system of personal development. Backpackers set out in droves, searching the Sonoran Desert for the elusive don Juan. Had anyone ever seen him? Was he real? Did Castaneda make him up? The questions were never answered to anyone's satisfaction. In fact, whole books were written on the subject, \"proving\" point-by-point that none of Castaneda's claims were true.\n\nReaders were shocked when, in 1981 with the publication of The Eagle's Gift, Castaneda informed them that don Juan and his party of sorcerers had transformed, left the world, and found their ultimate freedom. There would be no more roaming the desert, learning the intricate ways of knowledge. Convenient, some thought, because don Juan never existed in the first place...best to get rid of him so the seekers would call off their search!\n\nCastaneda would not grant interviews or make public appearances. His party of apprentices, of which he was now the leader -- the nagual -- continued to struggle to learn the ways of sorcery, but there were long silences between each book. Other rumors began: Castaneda was crazy. No one had seen him, he had disappeared.\n\nRecently a book appeared by Florinda Donner, Being-in-Dreaming, which revealed that the work continues and that Castaneda, rather than having gone insane or disappearing, has started a new generation of apprentices. Even more startling was the fact that Florinda was open to interviews and appearances -- though true to sorcerer tradition, she would not allow photographs to be taken of her. A sister apprentice, Taisha Abelar, followed with her book, The Sorcerer's Crossing, and fans/students of this mysterious tradition realized that a new era had begun.\n\nBody, Mind &amp; Spirit: Let's start by defining sorcery. Many people react very negatively to that word.\n\nFlorinda Donner: I have always resented the negative connotation associated with the terms sorcery and sorcerer. Don Juan Matus and his group explained that what is meant by sorcery in their tradition is something quite abstract: the ability, which some people develop, to expand the limits of normal perception. This abstract quality of sorcery automatically voids any positive or negative connotations.\n\nBMS: Is sorcery only a matter of perception?\n\nDonner: Sorcerers describe their knowledge, their pursuit, as the capacity to see energy directly, see the essence of things. What we do in the world of everyday life is to perceive only what we already know. We revalidate the world. Socialization gives us the concepts of what things are, and thus, we never really perceive what is actually there. We know \"truth\" a priori and all we do from then on is validate it. Sorcery is the act of erasing the a priori.\n\nOur world is real because, collectively, we have all agreed to it. This agreement is subliminal, we agree without knowing we are agreeing. The proof is that when we enter into other universes in dreaming -- or in the second attention as Castaneda calls it -- we suddenly see that there is more to us and the world than what we have been taught to see.\n\nBMS: What are dreaming and stalking in this tradition?\n\nDonner: They are two aspects of sorcery that form a nearly indivisible unit of action. In don Juan Matus's world, one is either a stalker or a dreamer. In that world there are two moieties, two female groups who, according to the sorcerers, can trace their lineage back twenty-seven generations. However, among the sorcerers, the descent is not biological but through affinities. One is adopted, so to speak, into a moiety -- one is either an Abelar or a Grau. I am a dreamer, so I am a Grau. Sometimes I use that name, either as Grau-Donner or Donner-Grau, depending on my mood. Whether you are a dreamer or a stalker depends on your energetic predisposition. You have a natural proclivity to one or the other.\n\nBMS: What does it mean to be a dreamer?\n\nDonner: The art of dreaming consists of using the natural movement of the assemblage point which flutters automatically in dreams. Carlos Castaneda has written extensively about the assemblage point and how sorcerers define perception. Sorcerers believe that perception takes place outside the sensorial realm. When sorcerers see, they see the body as a luminous egg. Within that luminous egg, which extends out from the body, is a small point, a glow, more luminous than the egg. That glow is awareness and that awareness assembles perception, which is why they call it the assemblage point. In our normal, everyday life, the assemblage point is static, it illuminates only certain bands of energy. The greatest accomplishment of our human upbringing is to lock our assemblage point onto its habitual position. Once immobilized, our perception can be coached and guided to interpret what we perceive. We learn to perceive in terms of our system of interpretation, then in turn, of our senses. Sorcerers know that something far more vast exists than what we have agreed to let our senses perceive.\n\nBMS: So when the assemblage point moves, new perception takes place?\n\nDonner: Precisely. When we dream, the assemblage point automatically flutters. Sorcerers make use of this natural condition and eventually train themselves to control this movement at will. What sorcerers strive to accomplish through dreaming is to have control over the general elements in a dream, a control comparable to the one we have over the elements of any situation in everyday life where we freely choose when and how to act.\n\nBMS: Where does stalking fit in?\n\nDonner: Stalking is the art of fixing the assemblage point in whatever position it has moved to in dreaming. When we are able to shift the assemblage point into a new band of energy, we automatically need to fix it so we can see what we perceive. Dreaming and stalking form a nearly indivisible unit of action.\n\nA sorcerer has to practice both of these aspects, and yet, one is better at one or the other. Besides Castaneda, my closest cohort is Taisha Abelar. The sorcerers paired me with her from the very beginning. She is a stalker. To me, she looks like a dreamer -- she is tall and thin and ethereally beautiful. She is sweet and patient and good-natured. And yet, she is the most aggressive being I know. She gets things done with minimal effort and fuss.\n\nBMS: What about Carlos Castaneda? Is he a stalker or a dreamer?\n\nDonner: As a sorcerer and a nagual, he has to be both. Yet I would say his predilection is dreaming. The nagual Juan Matus's predilection was stalking.\n\nBMS: Are women better at stalking or dreaming?\n\nDonner: They are better at both! Women are natural, peerless dreamers. Dreaming is a natural function of the womb. However, dreaming the way sorcerers dream is a matter of having energy at our disposal. Given enough energy, the body of a woman by itself will wake the womb's secondary functions and dream inconceivable dreams. The needed energy, however, is like aid to undeveloped countries -- it never arrives.\n\nBMS: Why not?\n\nDonner: The overall order of our social structures prevents that energy from being free so women can dream. Were that energy free, it would simply overthrow the \"civilized\" order of things. Women's great tragedy is that their social conscience completely dominates their individual conscience. Women fear being different (so do men, of course), and don't want to stray too far from the comforts of the known. The social pressures put upon women are overpowering and, rather than change, they acquiesce to what has been ordained: that woman exist to be at the service of men.\n\nBMS: Are you saying that women don t have a chance?\n\nDonner: No, I'm saying that most women prefer their safe shackles to the terror of the new. The sorcerer's proposition is a revolutionary one. Revolutionary not in terms of new ideologies but in terms of total, absolute change, a total commitment of body, mind and spirit. To uphold that commitment we need energy, an extraordinary amount of energy. Most of our energy is employed in protecting and holding up our inflated idea of self. In our own eyes we are special, precious beings no matter how wretched our condition. The self is our cage. It is a prison made up of commands and expectations poured onto us from the moment we are born.\n\nBMS: How can you free that energy?\n\nDonner: Sorcerers recapitulate their lives. A recapitulation consists of recollecting one's life down to the most insignificant detail. It is one of the most fundamental techniques sorcerers use for retrieving energy left behind in the world and also to reject the energy others have left in us. Recapitulation sets free energy imprisoned within us. Without this liberated energy, dreaming is not possible.\n\nBMS: How does one recapitulate one's life?\n\nDonner: The first step is to make a list of all the people you have met in your life. The list needs to be arranged in an orderly fashion, such as breaking it into areas of activity. You start from the present and go back into the past all the way to your parents, relieving everyone of interaction with you. You reconstruct the events, piece by piece, recollecting the physical details of the surroundings, then including the person with whom you shared an interaction, and then yourself, examining your feelings.\n\nIt is not like a psychological analysis, it is much more involved than that. The recapitulation is coupled with rhythmical breathing. A long exhalation is performed as the head moves gently and slowly from right to left. One long inhalation is taken as the head moves again from left to right. The mind examines the event from beginning to end, while the body fans everything the mind focuses on.\n\nBy the time we get back to our childhood experiences using this process, we realize that we are boring, repetitious people. We learn that by the time we are five or six years old we have learned one or two -- if we are lucky, perhaps three -- responses to manipulate the world around us. With different degrees of sophistication we use these responses over and over again when we interact with others. A good recapitulation forces us to see how boringly repetitious we actually are.\n\nBMS: What does this accomplish?\n\nDonner: It's liberating to shatter the idea that we are special, unique beings. It gives us a tremendous amount of freedom to pursue other possibilities. It helps us break the frail, yet resilient, shield of human assumptions about what we are and what we are capable of being.\n\nA proper recapitulation is an extraordinary ploy a sorcerer uses to induce a minute but steady displacement of the assemblage point. Under the impact of reviewing past actions and feelings, the assemblage point goes back and forth between its present site and the site it occupied when the event being recapitulated took place. It recovers a great deal of energy. This energy makes us see that only a deficiency in our social and cultural conditioning is what keeps us from entering into other realms that are as real as our everyday world.\n\nBMS: How many people are in your group?\n\nDonner: Not enough. There were sixteen sorcerers in the nagual Juan Matus's group. Together, they had the mass and energy to perform astounding feats. Our group, comprised of Castaneda, Taisha Abelar, myself, and a few other elusive, mysterious people I am not at liberty to name, has too few.\n\nBMS: What happened to the people Carlos Castaneda wrote about in his books?\n\nDonner: We are often with the little sisters -- Lydia, Josefina, and Rosa -- and the Genaros -- Nestor, Pablito, and Benigno -- either in Mexico or Los Angeles. However, their pursuits are different from ours. They are struggling to formulate and attain concrete goals extremely similar to the goals of the sorcerers of antiquity. For instance, Nestor, a practical botanist, wants to find a plant or clump of plants in the tundra which, according to the sorcerers' calculations, are over 300,000 years old. He wants to find them and sell them to Japanese pharmacologists for their regenerative properties. He thinks that those plants will enhance the sexual potency of men.\n\nThe women are equally involved in pursuits of this nature. Another example: Lydia wants to find a sorcerers' cure for AIDS, slowly emptying a sick person's body from the virus invasion by transmitting it to a tree. La Gorda had an attack of such intense self-importance in 1985 that she believed she was the only one of us who could lead us to freedom. She died in a futile attempt to reach beyond her energetic capabilities. Soledad is extremely well situated as a movie producer. She uses her arts in sorcery to gather money for her projects. Her motto is: Dollars from any source for movies.\n\nWhen La Gorda died, Carol Tiggs (the nagual woman) returned, which means to us that the sorcery configurations of don Juan's world are no longer applicable to us. We are on our own. Our group is composed of Carlos Castaneda, Taisha Abelar, Carol Tiggs and myself. Since we cannot see eye to eye with the concrete interests of the other apprentices, we have found ourselves in the odd situation of being explorers in a new territory, trying to find viable directions.\n\nCarlos Castaneda's readers will soon hear from him. Taisha Abelar, Carol Tiggs, and I found that it was imperative that Carlos send his manuscript on the art of dreaming to his agent for publication. Carlos finished writing it years ago, but believed that it was too outlandish for Consideration. Taisha, Carol, and I disagreed vehemently and succeeded.\n\nBMS: In your group and in don Juan's group there were more women sorcerers than men. Why is the leader, the nagual, always a male?\n\nDonner: It has nothing to do with being a better, more spiritual or more knowledgeable person. It is all a matter of energy, or the nagual's energy configuration. There is simply more energy.\n\nThere is an inherent difference in the way women and men approach knowledge. Men build toward knowledge, toward the spirit -- or whatever one wants to call it -- step by step. Sorcerers call this process coning. It's as if a cone of energy were sitting on top of their heads. This coning process limits men in how far they can reach. Their path toward knowledge ends up in a narrow point: the tip of the cone. In women the coning process is inverted, the cone is upside down. Women are able to open themselves directly to the source, or rather, the source reaches them directly. Sorcerers say that women's connection to knowledge is expansive and men's connection is quite restrictive.\n\nBMS: But why, then, does that make the nagual the leader?\n\nDonner: Carol Tiggs, as the nagual woman, could very easily be the leader of our group. However, it is a sorcerer's belief that women are universes in themselves. As universes they have no interest whatsoever in leading other universes! Sorcerers also believe that maleness is an extension of femaleness. Therefore, it is antithetical to the spirit of womanhood to lead. The nagual is not quite a leader; he is the person who lends the sorceresses soundmindedness, sobriety, and purpose. He can do this because of the heavy conditioning he suffered under the hands of the previous nagual.\n\nBMS: Does this make women more spiritually advanced than men?\n\nDonner: No, women are simply natural, peerless dreamers. The womb gives women that extra edge. Originally, women saw no need to exploit their facility to link themselves broadly and directly to the spirit. They saw no need to talk about it or to intellectualize this natural capacity. It was enough for them to know that they had it and put it into action. Men's incapacity to link directly to the spirit was what drove them to talk about the process of reaching knowledge -- and they haven't stopped talking about it. It is precisely this insistence on analyzing the process that gave them the certainty that being rational is a male skill. The conceptualization of reason has been done exclusively by men and this has allowed them to belittle women's gifts and accomplishments. Even worse, it has allowed men to exclude feminine traits from the formulation of the ideals of reason.\n\nBMS: Why don't women use their advantage?\n\nDonner: Women have forgotten their direct link with the spirit. They have forgotten how to use it, or rather, they have copied men's condition of not having it at all. For thousands of years men have struggled to make sure that women forget it. Men's need to dominate others and women's lack of interest in expressing or formulating what they know and how they know it has been a most nefarious alliance. It has made it possible for women to be coerced from the moment they are born into accepting that fulfillment lies in love, in marriage, in having children and in self-denial. Women have been excluded from the dominant forms of abstract thought and educated into dependence. Women have been so thoroughly trained in the belief that men must think for them that they have finally given up thinking.\n\nBMS: But there are a great many women thinkers, women of great accomplishments.\n\nDonner: Of course there are. However, what goes for women's thinking is their capacity to formulate what they have learned, and what they have learned has been defined by men. Men define the very nature of knowledge whether it be spiritual, scientific, or whatever, and from it they have excluded that which pertains to the feminine. Although women have access to knowledge, they have not been allowed to help determine what that knowledge is. If their knowledge is included it is always in a negative light. And women have accepted it. There are exceptions, but not enough to make a difference. Not yet.\n\nBMS: Is this tied into the crisis facing us in terms of our continued existence on the planet?\n\nDonner: It is a sorcerer's belief that the biological imperative of reproduction is something that cannot be altered, except by replacing it with another equally powerful imperative. They propose evolution as a counterbalance for reproduction. For sorcerers to evolve means to face our intrinsic nature. It means putting in brackets the current meaning of everything we are and do. In this manner sorcerers actually give the psyche a moment's rest, a moment long enough to start a rearrangement of priorities. If the compulsion to the male, the current basis of all our relationships, is replaced with the necessity to acknowledge the human spirit before anything else, sorcerers believe a very healthy society will emerge.\n\n*Body Mind Spirit Magazine,  Dec. 92, Vol. 11, Issue 6, pg. 44, 4 pages*\n\n*By Ken Eagle Feather and Carol Kramer*\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n[*source url*](https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=c764df0f-09b5-403f-afb5-6605acd65773%40redis&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=6204801&amp;db=awh) (*07458746) - may not be accessible to non USA residents.

It is a prison made up of commands and expectations poured onto us from the moment we are born.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BMS: How can you free that energy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donner: Sorcerers recapitulate their lives. A recapitulation consists of recollecting one&amp;#39;s life down to the most insignificant detail. It is one of the most fundamental techniques sorcerers use for retrieving energy left behind in the world and also to reject the energy others have left in us. Recapitulation sets free energy imprisoned within us. Without this liberated energy, dreaming is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BMS: How does one recapitulate one&amp;#39;s life?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donner: The first step is to make a list of all the people you have met in your life. The list needs to be arranged in an orderly fashion, such as breaking it into areas of activity. You start from the present and go back into the past all the way to your parents, relieving everyone of interaction with you. You reconstruct the events, piece by piece, recollecting the physical details of the surroundings, then including the person with whom you shared an interaction, and then yourself, examining your feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is not like a psychological analysis, it is much more involved than that. The recapitulation is coupled with rhythmical breathing. A long exhalation is performed as the head moves gently and slowly from right to left. One long inhalation is taken as the head moves again from left to right. The mind examines the event from beginning to end, while the body fans everything the mind focuses on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time we get back to our childhood experiences using this process, we realize that we are boring, repetitious people. We learn that by the time we are five or six years old we have learned one or two -- if we are lucky, perhaps three -- responses to manipulate the world around us. With different degrees of sophistication we use these responses over and over again when we interact with others. A good recapitulation forces us to see how boringly repetitious we actually are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BMS: What does this accomplish?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donner: It&amp;#39;s liberating to shatter the idea that we are special, unique beings. It gives us a tremendous amount of freedom to pursue other possibilities. It helps us break the frail, yet resilient, shield of human assumptions about what we are and what we are capable of being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A proper recapitulation is an extraordinary ploy a sorcerer uses to induce a minute but steady displacement of the assemblage point. Under the impact of reviewing past actions and feelings, the assemblage point goes back and forth between its present site and the site it occupied when the event being recapitulated took place. It recovers a great deal of energy. This energy makes us see that only a deficiency in our social and cultural conditioning is what keeps us from entering into other realms that are as real as our everyday world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BMS: How many people are in your group?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donner: Not enough. There were sixteen sorcerers in the nagual Juan Matus&amp;#39;s group. Together, they had the mass and energy to perform astounding feats. Our group, comprised of Castaneda, Taisha Abelar, myself, and a few other elusive, mysterious people I am not at liberty to name, has too few.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BMS: What happened to the people Carlos Castaneda wrote about in his books?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donner: We are often with the little sisters -- Lydia, Josefina, and Rosa -- and the Genaros -- Nestor, Pablito, and Benigno -- either in Mexico or Los Angeles. However, their pursuits are different from ours. They are struggling to formulate and attain concrete goals extremely similar to the goals of the sorcerers of antiquity. For instance, Nestor, a practical botanist, wants to find a plant or clump of plants in the tundra which, according to the sorcerers&amp;#39; calculations, are over 300,000 years old. He wants to find them and sell them to Japanese pharmacologists for their regenerative properties. He thinks that those plants will enhance the sexual potency of men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The women are equally involved in pursuits of this nature. Another example: Lydia wants to find a sorcerers&amp;#39; cure for AIDS, slowly emptying a sick person&amp;#39;s body from the virus invasion by transmitting it to a tree. La Gorda had an attack of such intense self-importance in 1985 that she believed she was the only one of us who could lead us to freedom. She died in a futile attempt to reach beyond her energetic capabilities. Soledad is extremely well situated as a movie producer. She uses her arts in sorcery to gather money for her projects. Her motto is: Dollars from any source for movies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When La Gorda died, Carol Tiggs (the nagual woman) returned, which means to us that the sorcery configurations of don Juan&amp;#39;s world are no longer applicable to us. We are on our own. Our group is composed of Carlos Castaneda, Taisha Abelar, Carol Tiggs and myself. Since we cannot see eye to eye with the concrete interests of the other apprentices, we have found ourselves in the odd situation of being explorers in a new territory, trying to find viable directions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos Castaneda&amp;#39;s readers will soon hear from him. Taisha Abelar, Carol Tiggs, and I found that it was imperative that Carlos send his manuscript on the art of dreaming to his agent for publication. Carlos finished writing it years ago, but believed that it was too outlandish for Consideration. Taisha, Carol, and I disagreed vehemently and succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BMS: In your group and in don Juan&amp;#39;s group there were more women sorcerers than men. Why is the leader, the nagual, always a male?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donner: It has nothing to do with being a better, more spiritual or more knowledgeable person. It is all a matter of energy, or the nagual&amp;#39;s energy configuration. There is simply more energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is an inherent difference in the way women and men approach knowledge. Men build toward knowledge, toward the spirit -- or whatever one wants to call it -- step by step. Sorcerers call this process coning. It&amp;#39;s as if a cone of energy were sitting on top of their heads. This coning process limits men in how far they can reach. Their path toward knowledge ends up in a narrow point: the tip of the cone. In women the coning process is inverted, the cone is upside down. Women are able to open themselves directly to the source, or rather, the source reaches them directly. Sorcerers say that women&amp;#39;s connection to knowledge is expansive and men&amp;#39;s connection is quite restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BMS: But why, then, does that make the nagual the leader?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donner: Carol Tiggs, as the nagual woman, could very easily be the leader of our group. However, it is a sorcerer&amp;#39;s belief that women are universes in themselves. As universes they have no interest whatsoever in leading other universes! Sorcerers also believe that maleness is an extension of femaleness. Therefore, it is antithetical to the spirit of womanhood to lead. The nagual is not quite a leader; he is the person who lends the sorceresses soundmindedness, sobriety, and purpose. He can do this because of the heavy conditioning he suffered under the hands of the previous nagual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BMS: Does this make women more spiritually advanced than men?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donner: No, women are simply natural, peerless dreamers. The womb gives women that extra edge. Originally, women saw no need to exploit their facility to link themselves broadly and directly to the spirit. They saw no need to talk about it or to intellectualize this natural capacity. It was enough for them to know that they had it and put it into action. Men&amp;#39;s incapacity to link directly to the spirit was what drove them to talk about the process of reaching knowledge -- and they haven&amp;#39;t stopped talking about it. It is precisely this insistence on analyzing the process that gave them the certainty that being rational is a male skill. The conceptualization of reason has been done exclusively by men and this has allowed them to belittle women&amp;#39;s gifts and accomplishments. Even worse, it has allowed men to exclude feminine traits from the formulation of the ideals of reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BMS: Why don&amp;#39;t women use their advantage?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donner: Women have forgotten their direct link with the spirit. They have forgotten how to use it, or rather, they have copied men&amp;#39;s condition of not having it at all. For thousands of years men have struggled to make sure that women forget it. Men&amp;#39;s need to dominate others and women&amp;#39;s lack of interest in expressing or formulating what they know and how they know it has been a most nefarious alliance. It has made it possible for women to be coerced from the moment they are born into accepting that fulfillment lies in love, in marriage, in having children and in self-denial. Women have been excluded from the dominant forms of abstract thought and educated into dependence. Women have been so thoroughly trained in the belief that men must think for them that they have finally given up thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BMS: But there are a great many women thinkers, women of great accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donner: Of course there are. However, what goes for women&amp;#39;s thinking is their capacity to formulate what they have learned, and what they have learned has been defined by men. Men define the very nature of knowledge whether it be spiritual, scientific, or whatever, and from it they have excluded that which pertains to the feminine. Although women have access to knowledge, they have not been allowed to help determine what that knowledge is. If their knowledge is included it is always in a negative light. And women have accepted it. There are exceptions, but not enough to make a difference. Not yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BMS: Is this tied into the crisis facing us in terms of our continued existence on the planet?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Donner: It is a sorcerer&amp;#39;s belief that the biological imperative of reproduction is something that cannot be altered, except by replacing it with another equally powerful imperative. They propose evolution as a counterbalance for reproduction. For sorcerers to evolve means to face our intrinsic nature. It means putting in brackets the current meaning of everything we are and do. In this manner sorcerers actually give the psyche a moment&amp;#39;s rest, a moment long enough to start a rearrangement of priorities. If the compulsion to the male, the current basis of all our relationships, is replaced with the necessity to acknowledge the human spirit before anything else, sorcerers believe a very healthy society will emerge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Body Mind Spirit Magazine,  Dec. 92, Vol. 11, Issue 6, pg. 44, 4 pages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Ken Eagle Feather and Carol Kramer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;amp;sid=c764df0f-09b5-403f-afb5-6605acd65773%40redis&amp;amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=6204801&amp;amp;db=awh\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;source url&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;07458746) - may not be accessible to non USA residents.

easily be the leader of our group. However, it is a sorcerer's belief that women are universes in themselves. As universes they have no interest whatsoever in leading other universes! Sorcerers also believe that maleness is an extension of femaleness. Therefore, it is antithetical to the spirit of womanhood to lead. The nagual is not quite a leader; he is the person who lends the sorceresses sound mindedness, sobriety, and purpose. He can do this because of the heavy conditioning he suffered under the hands of the previous nagual.\n\nI guess that explains the situation with Carol!\n\nAnd they told us 6  years before there was any reason to wonder about it, and even before it became obvious, Carol wasn't going to try to \"revive\" things.\n\nShe showed some specific techniques, but didn't try to bring enthusiasm back.\n\nWithout enthusiasm, the bad players took over the movement.\n\nIt also tells us how to replace Carlos.\n\nKeep the witches focused on something useful to the movement.\n\nI don't know how yet, but it might be that a practical activity could help.\n\nMapping out the tensegrity moves would be my preference.\n\nBut tracking down phantom realms could be another.\n\nI've been trying to map out just a single tensegrity pass, so Jadey and I can illustrate it in animation form.\n\nThe affection pass.\n\nBut I can never find the \"bottom\" of it.\n\nI almost expect to hear Fancy laughing at me for my clumsy attempts to map it.\n\nLast night I almost jumped out of my skin with surprise!  There's a real \"frame of the energy body\"???!!!\n\nSeems to be.\n\nIt is afterall, your double.  It's not just a phantom.  And it doesn't have a hard time appearing, the way IOBs do.

However, it is a sorcerer&amp;#39;s belief that women are universes in themselves. As universes they have no interest whatsoever in leading other universes! Sorcerers also believe that maleness is an extension of femaleness. Therefore, it is antithetical to the spirit of womanhood to lead. The nagual is not quite a leader; he is the person who lends the sorceresses sound mindedness, sobriety, and purpose. He can do this because of the heavy conditioning he suffered under the hands of the previous nagual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess that explains the situation with Carol!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they told us 6  years before there was any reason to wonder about it, and even before it became obvious, Carol wasn&amp;#39;t going to try to &amp;quot;revive&amp;quot; things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She showed some specific techniques, but didn&amp;#39;t try to bring enthusiasm back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without enthusiasm, the bad players took over the movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also tells us how to replace Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep the witches focused on something useful to the movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how yet, but it might be that a practical activity could help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mapping out the tensegrity moves would be my preference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But tracking down phantom realms could be another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trying to map out just a single tensegrity pass, so Jadey and I can illustrate it in animation form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The affection pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I can never find the &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot; of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I almost expect to hear Fancy laughing at me for my clumsy attempts to map it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night I almost jumped out of my skin with surprise!

Yep, that room is where Carlos taught us!](https://preview.redd.it/rdw06rgehya91.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c3c4bc2cc5e7670b1d897e2cb77a59562b65af0)\n\nThere's a post in the advanced subreddit explaining this, but the problem is, we have 99% \"students\", and only 1% \"users of magic\".\n\nThe \"students\" are here for reasons other than to learn magic.\n\nYou have to be very careful with them.\n\nThe hope is they'll \"wake up\", and become actually interested in sorcery.\n\nBut even a new person who hangs around a while and actually reads posts and comments, soon realizes that virtually everyone is a fraud.\n\nIncluding themselves.\n\nI'll leave that to the newest people to discover on their own, because usually those leave once they realize they can't become a \"teacher\".\n\nOr that there's no benefit at all to \"practice groups\", other than for learning Tensegrity movements.\n\nI said \"for learning\".  Not \"for using\".\n\nYou MUST become a user.  Not a learner.\n\nBut no one can motivate you to \"become real\".\n\nHopefully some animations of what you can do with sorcery would help more than the pictures.\n\nThe pictures take so long to do, that it's not possible to show \"the flow\" of magic.\n\nAn animation can.  From multiple angles!\n\nIdeally, you get silent, find a puff, and then play with them using tensegrity moves.\n\nThe tensegrity moves are MAGIC.  No kidding.\n\nBut they have to \"store up\" the magic, which they suck out of the dark sea of awareness.\n\nBy doing them in full silence, watching the puffs, you \"train\" the tensegrity form to become a \"magic spell\".\n\nAnd there's no limit to what those can do.\n\nI mean, NO LIMIT.\n\nThere's stuff we don't know, but from the point of view of your own direct experience, what you see, do, and feel, there's no limits.\n\nYou can literally swipe the ceiling of your dark room aside like it was electric, gaze up at the stars, fiddle the stars you see floating in the air with your fingers to \"zoom in\" and look for places to \"land\", and then literally leap towards a distant planet for real.\n\nWhen I say for real, I mean that 2 seconds before you leap, you could have turned on the light and gotten yourself a drink of water.\n\nIt's you, fully awake, eyes open.\n\nAnd when you leap, you simply leap.\n\nIt even hurts a little when you land on a planet outside our own galaxy.\n\nThat's what I mean by \"real\".\n\nHow that's possible, we just don't know.\n\nIt simply, \"works out\".\n\nThat's where we need to get the beginners to go.\n\nInto being \"users\", instead of \"students\".\n\nBut you have to stick around in this subreddit a while before you understand the difference.\n\nOne possible path for us to follow is to \"re-run\" all of the private classes and workshops, and animate them in full detail using modern cartoon making software.\n\nLike Blender.\n\nFor a sorcerer, all knowledge ever available to humans is right there at their fingertips.\n\nThey just need to move their assemblage point all the way along that J curve, to the \"Purple Station\".\n\nOut there you could be sitting on pillows on your bed in darkness, eyes open, and say, \"Another private class please\".\n\nAnd you'd be transported into the actual original private class.\n\nWhich you can watch in complete detail.\n\nYou just can't alter it in any way.\n\nOne person couldn't live long enough to recover all that we've lost.\n\nWhich includes the stories from the books of Carlos!  Those are \"available\" also.\n\nBut multiple people could recover them all.\n\nBeginners would then be able to attend all of the workshops and private classes, in person.\n\nKeep in mind: After years of workshops and classes the number who had learned actual sorcery was 0.\n\nThe number who attended them and would get angry at that statement,  and lash out, is 100%.\n\nSomehow everyone flattered themselves into accepting their own pretending!\n\nThese days they even \"interview\" each other on what sorcery is, with Youtube \"teaching\" channels.\n\nTeaching mental masturbation.\n\nIf you've been around 25 years masturbating, then you're qualified to be \"interviewed\" as an expert on the sorcery of Carlos.\n\nIt's very disturbing!\n\nIf there are people from that workshop crowd who wouldn't \"lash out\" at me for suggesting no one learned any actual sorcery, they belong to the group that decided Carlos was a fraud and gave up.\n\nWe have 2 groups, both delusional.  One angry and pretending to have succeeded, and one angry and making up stuff to give themselves permission to give it all up.\n\nWhy did that happen?\n\nThey were all \"students\".\n\nNo \"users\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Evil Plans", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"rdw06rgehya91": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 136, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rdw06rgehya91.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=282fafbb467d689b5be6732a5b254c57617f588b"}, {"y": 272, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rdw06rgehya91.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69cebf37839569e2a8eb30030c5411b51a9e40fa"}, {"y": 403, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rdw06rgehya91.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e3e27f9e3b3ceb31c5b64476b2df1b4a8c03963"}, {"y": 807, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rdw06rgehya91.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28074e4bce11030e49eb0d8d5e015ea1ff25cd5f"}, {"y": 1211, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rdw06rgehya91.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4282da0b4d4db60c58882a8a6291ac63091db1f3"}], "s": {"y": 1293, "x": 1025, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/rdw06rgehya91.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c3c4bc2cc5e7670b1d897e2cb77a59562b65af0"}, "id": "rdw06rgehya91"}}, "name": "t3_vwl3bz", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/oP_0VTLSbFU_gbPITjZdOhKYIJ6NkGzb26KZgZCyzXs.jpg", "edited": 1657554307.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1657553251.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rdw06rgehya91.png?width=1025&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7c3c4bc2cc5e7670b1d897e2cb77a59562b65af0\"&gt;A lesson from Silent Knowledge.

Would you say that when I felt like I had spent dreams \"learning\" about the magic from Tensegrity, and I remembered none of it in a way I could describe upon awakening, is that the Abstract? And would you say there is a way to push our tonal awareness into the Abstract in order to better translate that information into our everyday consciousness?\n\nAs for the IOBs, and telling them apart from other beings I communicate or work with... When I was four years old, I had a dream where I was walking through my house. I opened a door and found two \"cats\" on the bed. I \"knew\" they were supposed to represent cats, they were cat-shaped, but they were complete energy... like swirling cat-shapes of lightning or \"energy\", and two different colors. One was red, and the other blue, if I remember correctly. They had no \"eyes\" or any other features in the energy. But they both \"looked\" up at me when I opened the door, and jumped at me. I freaked out and woke up.\n\nIn high school, when following The Art of Dreaming, and I was traveling to other worlds and erasing phantoms in my dream in search of an IOB, I ended up on a lava/fire world, in a shack. My \"mom\" was in there with me, angry and yelling at me. Being lucid, I knew it wasn't her, and erased her, only to unveil a human-shaped form of swirling lightning red energy, that then rushed at me, and terrified, I woke up. I \"knew\" it was related to the cat-beings from my dream when I was little. Same kind of alien energy. IOBs, correct?\n\nI have been in dream worlds where I \"knew\" the beings around me were real, and alien, and I would do my best not to draw their attention. Are those IOBs, too? Just not showing their alien energy?\n\nHounded by beings trying to scare me when I was little, I assume those were IOBs, too? I would see them with my eyes open or closed. Or the creatures that followed me through into the waking world, and I would describe the \"monsters\" to my parents who had rushed in when I called for help, and the creatures were still in the room, even with the lights on.\n\nSince joining this group, and reading through various threads, I have \"reached out\" to the Olmec shaman line, and made contact while doing a walking meditation up a steep hill and tuning out the mental chatter. Energy became stronger and stronger, and I felt one come through and ask me why I want to learn this. I answered, \"so I can have greater wisdom,\" they asked why. I said, \"why does anyone want to understand anything? For greater understanding is the purpose.\" I heard laughter. I said, \"It's like if someone asks what you are going to do with a car when you don't even know what a car is or what you can do with it yet?\" I conveyed to them that I am seeking a greater understanding of awareness, a greater understanding of my consciousness, a greater understanding of my possibilities, with the intent to take that awareness through the universe. The exertion up the hill helped me focus even more on this connection with them, and they said I was seeking an Ally, so they said, \"You must intend the answer.\" I understood that as, I want an Ally, so I Intend an Ally and it's there. I was wondering, with my past interactions, about safety parameters in working with the IOBs, and I received a mental image of fire, with the understanding that this knowledge is like Fire, it's up to the person who is going to use it to determine how they use it and whether or not they burn themselves or burn down their house. They said the Ally only cares that I learn and not how I apply the knowledge. The Ally only cares that I seek the knowledge. My universe, where I determine all interactions and how they're going to happen. The Ally is there to teach, but on my terms. They asked me if I am a child or an adult. I said I'm an adult, so they said the responsibility is on me. I was concerned with \"greater good,\" and they said I am sovereign. My responsibility. My intention. I felt an Ally come in and \"merge\" with me. I understood there is no good or evil, right or wrong. There is knowledge and application of knowledge. I determine how I use it, and I take responsibility for it.\n\nI have felt this Ally trying to contact me \"here,\" in darkroom, as the sparkling energy puffs, but not something I can \"grab\" or move, and as intense pressure on my head. Same as last night, where it was starting to materialize. Whenever it comes in, there feels like there are two, one on each side of my head. I wonder if they are the \"cats\" I saw when I was four? I was having recent cat dreams, not lucid... two cats, but not quite \"right\", and they felt alien. In the dreams, unaware, I would sometimes attack or throw them away from me, though in the last dream I had of them, I was friendly with them and feeding them.\n\nWhich leads me to a question... recent dreams of strange creatures latching onto me, like a leech.

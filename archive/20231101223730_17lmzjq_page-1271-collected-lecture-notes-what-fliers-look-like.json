Carlos said  that the picture was an omen to start talking about the Flyers.\n\nThe reason  that he never discussed them before was that Don Juan told him that the  issue was so provocative that it would undermine his efforts to present  sorcery to the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Page 1271 Collected Lecture Notes, What Fliers Look Like", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Flyers (counter intent)"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 73, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"cxgt5cz83txb1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 56, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cxgt5cz83txb1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f1f3e56d568e211d9db7a9d2af6f6bb2c5e1ed5"}, {"y": 112, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cxgt5cz83txb1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d212d1eb864ae4b34748df16b16a26637db38a68"}, {"y": 167, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cxgt5cz83txb1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b02dcafb2c7ebde91052752297842eb510346e5"}, {"y": 334, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cxgt5cz83txb1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3dac9c2907c0da08350df11d81ca2dc4038b47d"}, {"y": 501, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cxgt5cz83txb1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19aed604b1c9b426df732ce99a340f01e14d0fff"}, {"y": 564, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cxgt5cz83txb1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaa5a920d760120a22e77c62f031eefb35982d57"}], "s": {"y": 1200, "x": 2296, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/cxgt5cz83txb1.png?width=2296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca11a5128fc8605c94eecc2e2cc2a67fbbf3d9ef"}, "id": "cxgt5cz83txb1"}}, "name": "t3_17lmzjq", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Flyers (counter intent)", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Wrm_68R19crZl1xCKfCCDv2-jG5caTgHOQE7I2Rb8dU.jpg", "edited": 1698877564.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1698874650.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cxgt5cz83txb1.png?width=2296&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ca11a5128fc8605c94eecc2e2cc2a67fbbf3d9ef\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/cxgt5cz83txb1.png?width=2296&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ca11a5128fc8605c94eecc2e2cc2a67fbbf3d9ef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please notice how diplomatic Carlos was about Asian fake magic...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;ll see I&amp;#39;m not hard on it without justification.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To: alt.dreams.castaneda&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Date: 3 Sep 1995 03:29:37 -0400&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Three Weeks With Carlos Castaneda&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prefacing Energy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goal of a sorcerer is to perceive energy as it flows in the universe. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There  were a lot of questions directed at Carlos about Auras, Chakras and spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He answered them by saying that sorcerers try to see energy as it flows in  the universe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When sorcerers first start to SEE they preface what they SEE  with attributes of the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the practices that sorcerers  engage in to develop their ability to handle the abstract and they lose their  prefaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other traditions develop their prefaces and never learn to get rid  of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This topic was discussed because of the picture of the Flyer  jumping over the pyramid at Teotihuacan.

Since Carlos had done that.\n\nBut all appearances are just \"prefaces\".\n\nYour expectations, mixed with what you have been told you will see, mixed with your religious background.

A nice, &amp;quot;pretty&amp;quot; one that meant no one any harm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An entity more like Tinkerbell was what I had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, it was just the same two Carlos left to his private classes, but I had &amp;quot;tamed&amp;quot; them by rejecting them for their fearful manifestations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &amp;quot;wrestled&amp;quot; the Ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot; showed up instead.  Ready to teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, it was still the same two entities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how &amp;quot;Minx&amp;quot; was turned from crazy man hiding behind the first Ally, then to a lizard, and then to a squirrel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I suspect Cholita did that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The theory is, Carlos left a &amp;quot;strand&amp;quot; of his own energy with her so she&amp;#39;d attract the Allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Cholita has a unique relationship with the wildlife around our home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe she had been trying to lure a squirrel into our yard more often?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx did likely start out as the &amp;quot;lizard&amp;quot; Carlos had to lure to show up on those rocks, so he could capture it in a cloth bag for the Devil&amp;#39;s Weed ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it obliged Cholita, and let her &amp;quot;lure&amp;quot; it out also.  Since Carlos had done that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all appearances are just &amp;quot;prefaces&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your expectations, mixed with what you have been told you will see, mixed with your religious background. And your worst fears at times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because in fact, such things are really just alien energy intruding into your awareness, and producing that phantom appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not real at all.  Only the alien energy is real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myself, I love the phantom appearances!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be sad, not pleased, when all I see is &amp;quot;energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the old seers liked their appearances too!

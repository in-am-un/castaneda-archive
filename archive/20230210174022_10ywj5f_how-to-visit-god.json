It's not really even all that difficult.\n\nYes, you have to be able to reach \"enlightenment\". But despite what the Buddha claims, it's no \"ultimate\" achievement.\n\nA woman in a nice comfortable bath, surrounded by candles and beautiful smelling flowers, can visit heaven.\n\nIt's unlikely, because there's 1 million better places to visit.\n\nBut they can.\n\nYou can even sit at the feet of God, and he'll answer a question for you!\n\nYou can find it in the workshop notes. Taisha reminded everyone to ask for something.\n\nIt's easy to forget!\n\nIn my own case, the first time I visited God, I was practicing silence during a thunderstorm.\n\nI believe the high humidity to be very useful for forcing silence in darkness. It soothes the skin, and if you want to keep your eyes open they don't dry out as often. Less need to rub them, so less chance to disturb your state of consciousness.\n\nKeep in mind, \"moving meditation\" is vastly superior to lame Asian style closed eyes with a big grin meditation. To suck up attention from on lookers.\n\nI was amused to see Hillary Clinton yesterday in the news, learning from a \"wise\" Indian man, telling her to \"smile with her whole face and body\" while she did meditation.\n\nEssentially teaching her to brainwash herself, so he could get attention and money from others.\n\nPerhaps one of the worst ways to explore consciousness is through meditation. You're sure to miss 90% of reality that way.\n\nWhich is why Tensegrity works so well. All of reality oozes between the cracks of those movements, which are filled with old seer \"practical magic\".\n\nMaybe, try to stay away from closed eye meditation zombies? They'll infect you, and you'll go \"walking dead\" too.\n\nBut in some cases, being \"stationary\" allows the assemblage point to assemble very specific bundles of emanations which are very easy to \"lose sight of\".\n\nAnd one of those is \"God\".  Perhaps just because he's been prayed to with people's eyes closed for so long, that's now part of who he is.\n\nBut how on earth is God there, among the emanations?\n\nIt's the \"phantom room\" effect.\n\nOur assemblage point focuses a beam of awareness into the dark sea of the emanations. It \"beams\" awareness into them, and they send back \"feelings\".\n\nVery tiny ones!  It takes trillions to make your daily world.\n\nAnd as we perceive that selection of those superstrings of feelings, they soak up something that causes them to be more likely to glow with awareness, in the future.\n\nForever in fact. That's how \"Silent Knowledge\" works. It reactivates those emantions to glow, and produce \"knowledge\" when you need some.\n\nNo information is ever lost from the dark sea! It just goes \"dormant\".\n\nThus in Taisha's last book, it turns out the house where she was living was not real. It was a phantom copy of Zuleica's home and yard. But not the real one.\n\nAt Pandora where Carlos lived (you know darned well he picked that street because it was amusing)  they'd also created a phantom copy of that house. Miles walked into it by accident.\n\nLikely in his double though. Frankly, you probably can't break the laws of physics if you are still fully in your tonal (physical) body.\n\nAnd so just as you can create such a phantom structure by perceiving it often, until it's so real others can share it with you, when people pray to God they are adding awareness into a phantom structure.\n\nTo \"all that is good of mankind\". All that is wise. All that is protective and nourishing.\n\nPeople pray to a God who can sooth them, and make their problems better. Daily for many!\n\nThe result is a phantom being.\n\nA \"Silent Knowledge\" entity.\n\nBut a \"special\" kind who has the awareness of billions of people behind him.\n\nMost silent knowledge entities, such as Porfirio from the books, have only your own awareness behind them.\n\nMy first visit to God was during a thunderstorm. More than 15 years ago. I had fallen into deep silence, and my assemblage point was drifting. As all will do at first when the assemblage point drifts too far at once, I blanked out.\n\nIt's not uncommon during meditation for the same reason. As pathetic as meditation forms always are, they do at least cause the assemblage point to drift to below the shoulder blades, and the selection of emanations at that position is entirely new to us. Until we \"hook\" to it and cause it to \"reassemble\" into a new view of the world, we're simply gone.\n\nBlanked out.\n\nAnd in that state, a loud lightning bolt struck what seemed to be right next door.\n\nFear echoed through my body as I was sitting up on pillows, gazing straight ahead.\n\nMy assemblage point was shifted with a jolt, my awareness was fully engaged by the fright from the thundering sound, and so an \"emergency\" view of the world assembled.\n\nI was right at the feet of God.\n\nHe said, \"What did you want to ask?\"\n\nI jumped off the bed and ran like hell.\n\nYou will too.\n\nCarlos on the other hand got greedy. He had don Juan helping him see God. I suppose that after don Juan showed him a couple of times, tricky Carlos figured out how to get there on his own.\n\nAnd quickly became a religious zealot. A true defender of God!\n\nDon Juan tried to explain who God really was. Sorcerers call him \"the mold of Man\".\n\nAnd Carlos also learned that God can't actually do anything on your behalf. He's just \"there\", and you can pray or speak to him if you like.\n\nBut he can't grant wishes.\n\nCarlos was furious at first, until he saw God for the 24th time (my guess), and realized, God is kind of boring.\n\nHe doesn't do much but look \"all knowing, benevolent, and wise with kindliness\".\n\nSanta Claus would be a lot more fun, with all those elves.\n\nSome of those elves are kind of hot, in Santa Claus movies.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How To Visit God", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"vj72ut693eha1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vj72ut693eha1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99d51c711fdea8e53ae91c1e1bdac1380b6f2f90"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vj72ut693eha1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2326c14ae53e12814617994f043ab5fda9f10897"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vj72ut693eha1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=213dd274b5065fcb9d3bd4cbac1fca2019edf2eb"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vj72ut693eha1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d9e141df6188c30b837fa77c113e679938e5a01"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vj72ut693eha1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84d6dedd18d5a1f6a66e887d1e799bb2ae2a108a"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vj72ut693eha1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=774cf9f41cae488a5f2c125ef48ee2e8c86d7262"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/vj72ut693eha1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ab56c8267e07149e312ab9aa42388360f87e808"}, "id": "vj72ut693eha1"}}, "name": "t3_10ywj5f", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/3mgv4OQReRmyRwj1c7i_efa39bY7k8yWF9lcnR8eDCk.jpg", "edited": 1676049109.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1676047222.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vj72ut693eha1.png?width=2048&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4ab56c8267e07149e312ab9aa42388360f87e808\"&gt;Even God has \\&amp;quot;bad hair days\\&amp;quot;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*** From Facebook ***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Musings About God&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every religion I&amp;#39;ve studied, including &amp;quot;magical systems&amp;quot; has stories of their &amp;quot;saints&amp;quot; visiting God, hell, and heaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because you can!

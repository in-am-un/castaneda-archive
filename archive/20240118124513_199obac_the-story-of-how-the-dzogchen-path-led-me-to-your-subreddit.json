And that thus modern Buddhism is still his teaching.\n\nMy other comment explains that the well known Buddha never actually existed.\n\nAnd people always try to argue against that by pretending \"the historical Buddha\" was the source of the Chinese fake Buddha.  Even if the Chinese made some changes.\n\nThere's no way to know that.\n\nNOTHING was written down, and oral traditions are notoriously unreliable. It took hundreds of years before the Chinese came to steal his franchise and import it to China.\n\nThose oral traditions would have to be VERY reliable to survive that long.\n\nThat's only an argument which appeals to supporters of oral traditions who have ulterior motivations.\n\nThey claim they are reliable, but unbiased scholars will tell you they are not.\n\nExperience in this subreddit will tend to cause you to align with the idea that oral traditions are **unreliable** and that a few hundred years is enough to mostly change them.\n\nHowever,  if that's so that the oral traditions of the original Buddha are mostly intact,  then they spell doom for the historical Buddha too.\n\nLet's look at them:\n\n\"**The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha)**: This truth asserts that all existence is characterized by suffering and unsatisfactoriness. It encompasses the physical and psychological experiences of pain, as well as a deeper sense of unfulfillment or imperfection.\"\n\nNonsense.  There are 600 alternate versions of ourselves easily available to visit when you reach silent knowledge. There's shapeshifting, phantom permutations of reality, and even virtual living spaces.\n\nTrue, we aligned ourselves to these physical bodies, and those are subject to physical pain.\n\nBut this isn't actually \"us\".  Just something we got stuck in temporarily.\n\nAnd most of the suffering Buddhists are referring to here, is self-pity.  Which goes away once the assemblage point switches sides on the body.\n\nWorry, grief, sadness. All go away.\n\nPhysical pain however is tied to the physical matter, and so it's much harder to escape while you're still trapped in this flesh body.\n\nWhich the \"old seers\" found a way out of, by burying their physical bodies and letting them die, while their awareness lived on in that location.\n\nYou can actually visit some of those \"death defiers\" near Mexico city.\n\nThis \"noble truth\" is merely a description of the \"Island of the Tonal\", which sorcery seeks to travel outside.  That's sorcery's entire purpose!\n\nAnd we do.  Even in this subreddit.\n\nIt's not some sacred scroll make believe.\n\nNot to mention, what's this \"perfection\"?\n\nIn whose eyes???\n\nThat in itself is a delusional understanding of reality. Nothing out there cares about you more than anything else.  You're no more important than an ant.\n\nAnd \"perfect\" for what?\n\nIt's a bullying tacting to guilt trip people to follow a make believe magical system.  To insist if you don't, you won't be \"perfect\".\n\nSorcerers can even go live with the inorganic beings for perhaps millions of years, in their weird form.  A non-organic, and thus beyond pain, existence.\n\nCarlos visited some realms where the inhabitants sought out quiet and lack of vibrations. They were so different from us that it's hard to even imagine what existence was like for them.\n\nIn another world he had 360 degree vision.\n\nBut Buddhists are absolutely unaware of how many different ways they can experience reality.\n\nThey're so trapped in this one that they call being here a \"noble truth\".  And they only try to escape it by closing their eyes and dozing off semi-asleep to mini dream and claim that's a \"vision\".\n\n\"**The Truth of the Cause of Suffering (Samudaya)**: This explains that suffering is caused by desire and clinging. It's not just about physical wants, but also about the desire for life to be different than it is, which includes the desires for permanence, pleasure, and existence or non-existence.\"\n\nNonsense. The cause of our normal daily life suffering is the position our assemblage point occupies, which is obsessed with \"me, me, me\".\n\nA thing Buddhists never discovered, because there's no money in discovering it.\n\nIt was discovered before money. Back when there was no gain from practicing fake magic, because there was no one to sell it to.\n\nSo any magic the Olmecs learned, was for themselves alone. Over thousands of years.\n\nWe just got lucky that our form of magic can't be hidden from others who seek it.

And that thus modern Buddhism is still his teaching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My other comment explains that the well known Buddha never actually existed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And people always try to argue against that by pretending &amp;quot;the historical Buddha&amp;quot; was the source of the Chinese fake Buddha.  Even if the Chinese made some changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no way to know that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOTHING was written down, and oral traditions are notoriously unreliable. It took hundreds of years before the Chinese came to steal his franchise and import it to China.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those oral traditions would have to be VERY reliable to survive that long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s only an argument which appeals to supporters of oral traditions who have ulterior motivations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They claim they are reliable, but unbiased scholars will tell you they are not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Experience in this subreddit will tend to cause you to align with the idea that oral traditions are &lt;strong&gt;unreliable&lt;/strong&gt; and that a few hundred years is enough to mostly change them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However,  if that&amp;#39;s so that the oral traditions of the original Buddha are mostly intact,  then they spell doom for the historical Buddha too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at them:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha)&lt;/strong&gt;: This truth asserts that all existence is characterized by suffering and unsatisfactoriness. It encompasses the physical and psychological experiences of pain, as well as a deeper sense of unfulfillment or imperfection.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nonsense.  There are 600 alternate versions of ourselves easily available to visit when you reach silent knowledge. There&amp;#39;s shapeshifting, phantom permutations of reality, and even virtual living spaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;True, we aligned ourselves to these physical bodies, and those are subject to physical pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this isn&amp;#39;t actually &amp;quot;us&amp;quot;.  Just something we got stuck in temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And most of the suffering Buddhists are referring to here, is self-pity.  Which goes away once the assemblage point switches sides on the body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worry, grief, sadness. All go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Physical pain however is tied to the physical matter, and so it&amp;#39;s much harder to escape while you&amp;#39;re still trapped in this flesh body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which the &amp;quot;old seers&amp;quot; found a way out of, by burying their physical bodies and letting them die, while their awareness lived on in that location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can actually visit some of those &amp;quot;death defiers&amp;quot; near Mexico city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This &amp;quot;noble truth&amp;quot; is merely a description of the &amp;quot;Island of the Tonal&amp;quot;, which sorcery seeks to travel outside.  That&amp;#39;s sorcery&amp;#39;s entire purpose!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we do.  Even in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not some sacred scroll make believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, what&amp;#39;s this &amp;quot;perfection&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In whose eyes???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That in itself is a delusional understanding of reality. Nothing out there cares about you more than anything else.  You&amp;#39;re no more important than an ant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; for what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bullying tacting to guilt trip people to follow a make believe magical system.  To insist if you don&amp;#39;t, you won&amp;#39;t be &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers can even go live with the inorganic beings for perhaps millions of years, in their weird form.  A non-organic, and thus beyond pain, existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos visited some realms where the inhabitants sought out quiet and lack of vibrations. They were so different from us that it&amp;#39;s hard to even imagine what existence was like for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In another world he had 360 degree vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Buddhists are absolutely unaware of how many different ways they can experience reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re so trapped in this one that they call being here a &amp;quot;noble truth&amp;quot;.  And they only try to escape it by closing their eyes and dozing off semi-asleep to mini dream and claim that&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;vision&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;The Truth of the Cause of Suffering (Samudaya)&lt;/strong&gt;: This explains that suffering is caused by desire and clinging. It&amp;#39;s not just about physical wants, but also about the desire for life to be different than it is, which includes the desires for permanence, pleasure, and existence or non-existence.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nonsense. The cause of our normal daily life suffering is the position our assemblage point occupies, which is obsessed with &amp;quot;me, me, me&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A thing Buddhists never discovered, because there&amp;#39;s no money in discovering it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was discovered before money. Back when there was no gain from practicing fake magic, because there was no one to sell it to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So any magic the Olmecs learned, was for themselves alone. Over thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We just got lucky that our form of magic can&amp;#39;t be hidden from others who seek it. Once a new thing is discovered, it becomes visible to all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as God is visible to all, simply because people focused awareness on the idea of him through prayer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They &amp;quot;made God real&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our system, the old seers practiced thousands of years in secret, but their secrets almost immediately became known to the other seers of their time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhists never escape this reality at all.

with your superpowers, and only had to practice your flying a little, in order to master it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Superman didn&amp;#39;t spend much time learning to master any of his superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He only had to discover his own greatness and play with it a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what fake magic people assume about sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That there&amp;#39;s no lifelong process to be able to use it for anything practical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They want the path to be as short and effort free as possible so they keep trying to pretend it&amp;#39;s that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This also leads to the delusion that if you move your assemblage point, it will eventually remain in those favorable other positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A belief in &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got that in chat yesterday or the day before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A new practitioner tried to say that once you reach a further point along the J curve, you stay there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you don&amp;#39;t!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You always return to being bumbling clumsy Clark Kent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The superman effect is when you ignore the endless hard work needed all the way along the path of learning sorcery, and try to turn it into a comic book story.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_199obac", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/199obac/the_story_of_how_the_dzogchen_path_led_me_to_your/kikvgb1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1705667622.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1705667622.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kiiuht7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "WitchyCreatureView", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kiggtw1", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_f4drk2qst", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;And none of us can select what we want to view yet.\n\nIf someone is able to make their specific wishes the intent of The Eagle and Silent Knowledge then they should be able to communicate in any language they want just by intending to see the words and pronunciations for what they want to say, not to worsen your super man syndrome.", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kiiuht7", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And none of us can select what we want to view yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone is able to make their specific wishes the intent of The Eagle and Silent Knowledge then they should be able to communicate in any language they want just by intending to see the words and pronunciations for what they want to say, not to worsen your super man syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_199obac", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/199obac/the_story_of_how_the_dzogchen_path_led_me_to_your/kiiuht7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1705626929.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1705626929.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kiggtw1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kig900x", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "You won't in here.

a single word can be found to describe it, even after you spend hours interacting with something in the abstract realm, where it seems perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of what I practice at

It's considered \"wise business\".\n\nI know. I have an office in Taiwan, and visit China with friends who understand the culture and know it's important to describe what's going on honestly to me.  Usually Asian guides hide their dirty little secrets from foreigners.\n\nChinese business ethics don't completely align with ours!\n\nEven to this day the Chinese will make up some magical martial artist \"master\" from 2 or 3 hundreds years ago (who never existed), and start a new Kung Fu school.\n\nThe locals know this well.\n\nBut westerners are naive about Asian esoteric dishonesty.\n\nThe \"historical\" Buddha was nothing like the Chinese one. He was a typical mediocre Yogi living in north India who never left, and whose teachings were never written down. Not for hundreds of years.\n\nSelling the same old barely functional closed eye meditation techniques they've had since Ishtarism back in the middle east.\n\nThe same tree that Judaism came from.\n\nLikely all coming from North African shamanism originally if you follow the migration patterns from back then.\n\nFrom before money.  That's when real magic existed on earth.\n\nBefore money came along.\n\nIt came to be \"Buddhism\", through Hinduism and Chinese religious scammers.\n\nThere were dozens like the historical Buddha living in northern India in any given year.\n\nThe original Buddhism had an oral tradition, but those change with every new group leader who comes along and wants to increase donations.\n\nWe have that problem with the people who are taking over for Carlos.\n\nThey're making up whatever they like, in order to stay in business.\n\nLately they're pushing a binary enlightenment delusion in their \"advanced courses\".\n\nIt's universal in magical systems and religions that after the original leader dies, everything changes each generation.\n\nSo the Chinese just made up whatever they liked to become \"Buddhism\", modifying it to fit with their own Daoism, Confucianism, and Pacific Islander shamanism.  And especially, modifying it to fit with the \"Seniority System\" common in Asia.\n\nThey didn't have a caste system (much). They had a seniority system.\n\nThus we ended up with the delusion of binary achievements.  Where some experience is transformative.  Makes you \"enlightened\".\n\nIt has to be so in China. That the \"master\" can never become \"not a master\".\n\nBut anyone who actually has to deal with old Buddhist masters will tell you what bastards they become as they age. They're famous for treating their wives very badly\n\nThe idea of \"enlightenment\" is death to magic.   You'll never get anywhere worth going, since most of reality is far beyond humanness and takes place outside this realm.\n\nYou have to LEAVE \"The Island of the Tonal\". There's no way to learn anything significant until you escape it.\n\nWhich Buddhism never does. You can tell from their writings.\n\nAnd since dazzling magical insights happen 20 times a night for those practicing the real thing, every single night, once you reach the orange zone on our J curve you come to realize the ugly nature of believing in \"enlightenment\".\n\nIt's just a marketing ploy which has a hidden promise of your own throne to sit on. Something which appeals to angry men.\n\nIn fact, part of the process of actually learning the real thing is to realize how pointless such realizations are. It's all about sending your awareness deeper and deeper into non-human realms.  To explore all we can in the dark sea of awareness, which is pretty much infinite.  Our world is only an extremely tiny patch in it.\n\nIf you believe you have \"achieved\" anything you'll stop working hard out of laziness, and start collecting donations from others so that you don't have to work a real job.\n\nSince there wasn't an organized temple system in Asia when the Chinese first imported \"Buddhism\" along the silk road,  and thus no reliable place for marriages, funerals, community festivals, and counselors to talk to when there were problems in someone's life, the Buddhist temple system spread over Asia like a plague.\n\nVery good in some ways, but extremely bad in others.  Such as their brutal behavior when opposing their religious enemies.\n\nThey took over prostitution in most places, including child prostitution.  They even use that to blackmail businessmen in Tokyo to this day. The \"Miko\" are a common dirty joke topic in Japan.\n\nIn Taiwan they tried to outlaw child prostitution a while back, but pressure from the Buddhist temple system led to making exceptions for 10 girls.  I never got to find out why, but likely those were needed to maintain political power.\n\nThe rising Buddhist crime syndicate led to serious corruption in governments there, as the Temple system bullied old Asian men into giving up valuable land, in exchange for a promise of heaven and a better re-incarnation.\n\nUsing the valuable land, they got control over local governments.\n\nBuddhism is in fact, simply evil.  It includes child slavery most places I've seen it in operation in Asia.  Where little boys given to the monks to do with as they please, become drummer boys in funeral processions, while dressed in saffron robes.\n\nYou can see them beating drums as the funeral trucks go by in Taipei, often accompanied by teenage girls in bikinis dancing beside a huge picture of the wealthy dead Chinese guy.\n\nThe slave boys grow up to be toothpick chewing gangsters who run the cheap prostitution in the confessional booths around the temple.\n\nBut all other religions are also evil, if you look carefully at their history.  The Catholic church ran prostitution in Europe until venereal disease made it \"immoral\".\n\nCarlos was fond of a book entitled, \"The Sex Lives of the Popes\", which describes aborted fetuses lined up in the catacombs below the Pope's palace, presumably from nuns.\n\nOf course we've all seen recently that the Dali Lama has an issue with little boys.  And seems to feel entitled to get away with it.\n\nAs evil goes, there's even worse religions. Such as Islam.\n\nBut the Buddhist system is just a bit more successful in Asia.\n\nAnd pretends to be intellectual and \"proper\", when it's nothing like that at all.\n\nThe original Buddha was popular mostly because he had a Gandhi like message that the caste system was false, and the Upanishads were wrong on that issue.\n\nTo recruit more people, he promised that your caste was irrelevant in his school of meditation, and your \"rank\" was only dependant on how soon you joined him.\n\nAny accomplished beginner in here beats the real Buddha hands down for supernatural knowledge and magical abilities.\n\nYou can look at the feed and honestly see that.\n\nBut it's nice to know that not all Buddhism is nothing but social status seeking and lame closed eye meditation effects any woman can get in a bath surrounded by flowers and candles.\n\nThe Dzogchen subreddit banned me permanently, mostly for suggesting they could have Dzogchen, without the Buddhism.\n\nI was pretty much suggesting what you did in this post. That the magic is not married to the delusional religion.\n\nThat got me banned.\n\nThank goodness.  Buddhists are some of the angriest people we come up against in there.\n\nThey seem to feel entitled to some respect that makes no sense to me.\n\nIt's just another foreign religion some white guys imported to sell to the naive here.\n\nNot too long ago in fact.  Can't be more than 100 years since the intellectuals here began to spread it around.", "edited": 1705590258.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kifq9r4", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe Techno should consider adding this to the wiki page on Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, there never was a Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should chat with ChatGPT about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as there never was a Lao Tzu, the &amp;quot;creator&amp;quot; of Daoism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Chinese made him up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s common to do that in China, and not even considered wrong.

You&amp;#39;ll never get anywhere worth going, since most of reality is far beyond humanness and takes place outside this realm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to LEAVE &amp;quot;The Island of the Tonal&amp;quot;. There&amp;#39;s no way to learn anything significant until you escape it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which Buddhism never does. You can tell from their writings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And since dazzling magical insights happen 20 times a night for those practicing the real thing, every single night, once you reach the orange zone on our J curve you come to realize the ugly nature of believing in &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a marketing ploy which has a hidden promise of your own throne to sit on. Something which appeals to angry men.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, part of the process of actually learning the real thing is to realize how pointless such realizations are. It&amp;#39;s all about sending your awareness deeper and deeper into non-human realms.  To explore all we can in the dark sea of awareness, which is pretty much infinite.  Our world is only an extremely tiny patch in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you believe you have &amp;quot;achieved&amp;quot; anything you&amp;#39;ll stop working hard out of laziness, and start collecting donations from others so that you don&amp;#39;t have to work a real job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since there wasn&amp;#39;t an organized temple system in Asia when the Chinese first imported &amp;quot;Buddhism&amp;quot; along the silk road,  and thus no reliable place for marriages, funerals, community festivals, and counselors to talk to when there were problems in someone&amp;#39;s life, the Buddhist temple system spread over Asia like a plague.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very good in some ways, but extremely bad in others.  Such as their brutal behavior when opposing their religious enemies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They took over prostitution in most places, including child prostitution.  They even use that to blackmail businessmen in Tokyo to this day. The &amp;quot;Miko&amp;quot; are a common dirty joke topic in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan they tried to outlaw child prostitution a while back, but pressure from the Buddhist temple system led to making exceptions for 10 girls.  I never got to find out why, but likely those were needed to maintain political power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rising Buddhist crime syndicate led to serious corruption in governments there, as the Temple system bullied old Asian men into giving up valuable land, in exchange for a promise of heaven and a better re-incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using the valuable land, they got control over local governments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buddhism is in fact, simply evil.  It includes child slavery most places I&amp;#39;ve seen it in operation in Asia.  Where little boys given to the monks to do with as they please, become drummer boys in funeral processions, while dressed in saffron robes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see them beating drums as the funeral trucks go by in Taipei, often accompanied by teenage girls in bikinis dancing beside a huge picture of the wealthy dead Chinese guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The slave boys grow up to be toothpick chewing gangsters who run the cheap prostitution in the confessional booths around the temple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all other religions are also evil, if you look carefully at their history.  The Catholic church ran prostitution in Europe until venereal disease made it &amp;quot;immoral&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was fond of a book entitled, &amp;quot;The Sex Lives of the Popes&amp;quot;, which describes aborted fetuses lined up in the catacombs below the Pope&amp;#39;s palace, presumably from nuns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course we&amp;#39;ve all seen recently that the Dali Lama has an issue with little boys.  And seems to feel entitled to get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As evil goes, there&amp;#39;s even worse religions. Such as Islam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the Buddhist system is just a bit more successful in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And pretends to be intellectual and &amp;quot;proper&amp;quot;, when it&amp;#39;s nothing like that at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The original Buddha was popular mostly because he had a Gandhi like message that the caste system was false, and the Upanishads were wrong on that issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To recruit more people, he promised that your caste was irrelevant in his school of meditation, and your &amp;quot;rank&amp;quot; was only dependant on how soon you joined him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any accomplished beginner in here beats the real Buddha hands down for supernatural knowledge and magical abilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can look at the feed and honestly see that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s nice to know that not all Buddhism is nothing but social status seeking and lame closed eye meditation effects any woman can get in a bath surrounded by flowers and candles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Dzogchen subreddit banned me permanently, mostly for suggesting they could have Dzogchen, without the Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was pretty much suggesting what you did in this post. That the magic is not married to the delusional religion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That got me banned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank goodness.  Buddhists are some of the angriest people we come up against in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They seem to feel entitled to some respect that makes no sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just another foreign religion some white guys imported to sell to the naive here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago in fact.

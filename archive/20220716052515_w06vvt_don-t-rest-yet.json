So if you view that stream of claims, you&amp;#39;ll be deviated off into pretending yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t mean Ayahuasca isn&amp;#39;t helpful as medicine!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Einstein was conducting &amp;quot;thought experiments&amp;quot; using LSD.  They found it in his brain after he died (they saved his head....)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chinese use hallucinogens in traditional meditation.  Morning glory seeds for one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really nothing to do with sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I made a post last night which could explain this in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We seek to learn about &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to have vivid, crazy drug experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos gave that impression in his early books, but that might have been a trick cooked up by don Juan himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To create an &amp;quot;audience&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, I &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; that last night, while watching the emanations themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That we&amp;#39;d all been tricked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the words of Carlos returned to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;quot;I created the books to hook you.  Now you&amp;#39;re hooked and I&amp;#39;m right here.  Stop reading those!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t apply to anyone now, since Carlos is NOT here with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s worth understanding that in all likelihood, we&amp;#39;re pawns of don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who used &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, to create a 3rd path to sorcery knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the old seers &amp;quot;lone wolf&amp;quot; method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the lineages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;audience&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose &amp;quot;witness&amp;quot; too.  Might be worth looking up &amp;quot;witness&amp;quot; in the combined books and lecture notes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But some of the &amp;quot;audience members&amp;quot; will become huge fans, and participate in the story telling when there&amp;#39;s no new ones to be had.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve even counted how many! 1 in 100 become &amp;quot;active audience&amp;quot; people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect that&amp;#39;s our path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To learn &amp;quot;the mastery of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, through directly watching it as stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our own lives!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;quot;struggle&amp;quot; to make it work, is the key to the stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not popping a pill!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the struggle that teaches about &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This becomes FULLY visible at the end of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It even turns out, Carlos gave us a pass that works directly on the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cleargreen just never gave it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that wasn&amp;#39;t a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s something for the &amp;quot;Active Audience&amp;quot; to explore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boba Fett...

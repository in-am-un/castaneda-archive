There is SOOOO much info, it is very confusing. I wanted to jump into the work right away but couldn't make sense of all the lingo. So I had to pause on doing the work and read first, even though I didn't want to.\n\n[Here are the first three books in audio form on Spotify. ](https://spotify.link/nGlplI0W2xb). The list of books is in the wiki. I just finished the 4th one, \"Tales of Power\" (which I couldn't find on Spotify, but did on YouTube). I am REALLY glad I started listening before I started practicing because the knowledge starts coming to you. Things start to click in your head and you understand WHY you're doing the work. I would listen to a passage and sometimes repeat it 3 or 4 times just to really let it sink in. The stories in the book are tremendous.\n\nTo answer your question, all of this work is done to change your perception. From the moment of your birth, you have been conditioned to look at the world a certain way. The reason you're here, why all of us are here, is that you can feel that there is more to reality than what you can presently see. This work is here to show you how to do it. No one will ask you for money or charge you for training. You have to put in the effort yourself, but with consistency, it starts to pay off. \n\nBefore I started doing real darkroom practice, I decided to listen to the books with my eyemask on. It helped me train myself to keep my eyes open in the dark and focus my attention on the book being read. Little by little, I can stay awake longer and feel that I have more control of my attention. As I have followed along with the books, something will intrigue me and I'll use the subreddit to help me understand the concept more. Don't use it as a starting point, use it as a companion to the books at first. Now that I am more Adept, reading through the posts make more sense but I still have a LONG way to go. \n\n\nRead the books. Read the books.

There is SOOOO much info, it is very confusing. I wanted to jump into the work right away but couldn&amp;#39;t make sense of all the lingo. So I had to pause on doing the work and read first, even though I didn&amp;#39;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://spotify.link/nGlplI0W2xb\"&gt;Here are the first three books in audio form on Spotify. &lt;/a&gt;. The list of books is in the wiki. I just finished the 4th one, &amp;quot;Tales of Power&amp;quot; (which I couldn&amp;#39;t find on Spotify, but did on YouTube). I am REALLY glad I started listening before I started practicing because the knowledge starts coming to you. Things start to click in your head and you understand WHY you&amp;#39;re doing the work. I would listen to a passage and sometimes repeat it 3 or 4 times just to really let it sink in. The stories in the book are tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To answer your question, all of this work is done to change your perception. From the moment of your birth, you have been conditioned to look at the world a certain way. The reason you&amp;#39;re here, why all of us are here, is that you can feel that there is more to reality than what you can presently see. This work is here to show you how to do it. No one will ask you for money or charge you for training. You have to put in the effort yourself, but with consistency, it starts to pay off. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I started doing real darkroom practice, I decided to listen to the books with my eyemask on. It helped me train myself to keep my eyes open in the dark and focus my attention on the book being read. Little by little, I can stay awake longer and feel that I have more control of my attention. As I have followed along with the books, something will intrigue me and I&amp;#39;ll use the subreddit to help me understand the concept more. Don&amp;#39;t use it as a starting point, use it as a companion to the books at first. Now that I am more Adept, reading through the posts make more sense but I still have a LONG way to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Read the books. Read the books. Read the books. \nIt will make sense bit by bit and it&amp;#39;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11mrueg/can_somebody_simplify_the_darkroom_technique_for/jbn67ni/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1678428725.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_11mrueg", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbjliu8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1678373585.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11mrueg", "score": 13, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "You've made the classic mistake.\n\nDon't take this the wrong way, because everyone makes this mistake.\n\nAsian magical systems are greatly responsible for this misunderstanding, because they're all in it to steal money.

Google, or sorcery.\n\nBut either way, there's no \"winners\" out there.\n\nNor any that are \"wise\".\n\nThey're \"chicken coop\" wisdom.\n\nWisdom of the hens stuck in the chicken coop, waiting to be food.  And pecking anyone who tries to escape the coop, right on the head.\n\nNext time you're in a pet shop, go find the finches.\n\nSee if they've selected a \"victim\".\n\nWatch them casually eat his head, while he's still alive.\n\nThey peck it, it bleeds, they eat the scab.\n\nWelcome to the magic subreddits!\n\nIt's universal. That's one benefit of trying to recruit in magic subreddits.\n\nTo see that it's all the same old shit.\n\nA few people have control over a subreddit, and nothing can make them look bad, or you get banned.\n\nEven if it's obviously something they ought to be discussing, or at least, have the ability to explain.\n\nBut they won't.  \n\nChurch behavior is precisely the same.\n\nDid you all know, Christian ministers have virtually no knowledge of the bible?\n\nIt's true!\n\nI'm not sure most even believe it.\n\nJust to give you an example, ask a minister what \"uncovered his father's nakedness\" means.\n\nIt's in Leviticus!  They define it there!\n\nBut I have yet to meet a minister who knows the common sense meaning of it.\n\nSo when it says that Ham \"uncovered his father's nakedness\", it's referring to Leviticus.\n\nThe nakedness of Noah, was his wife.\n\nIt's a polite way of referring to marital affairs.\n\nShe was Ham's step mother.\n\nHam got Noah drunk, possibly drugged up his wife, and raped her.\n\nThe result was a child, Canaan.  Noah cursed him and sent him away.\n\nSo it ought to be obvious.\n\nBut look at this google result:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhat did it mean when Ham saw his father's nakedness?\r  \nHe became jealous of Noah's additional children born after the deluge, and began to view his father with enmity, and one day, when Noah lay drunk and naked in his tent, Ham saw him and sang a mocking incantation that rendered Noah temporarily sterile, as if castrated.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nChristianity is such a mess, that's the level of  understanding for their \"sacred texts\".\n\nIt doesn't even make sense, and implies Ham had magical powers.\n\nI can't think of any other obsession where people don't bother to learn about their obsession.\n\nYou could find people obsessed with little red wagons, and if you made a mistake describing the 1960s version of the Radio Flyer, you'd find a nerd in the group who could correct your mistake. And no hard feelings involved. It's just facts.\n\nBut not with religion.\n\nThe instant you try to ask about something, people start to turn nasty and sullen.

When I travel in the energy body, it's always early in the morning, on a weekend, when everyone is sleeping in, like a lazy Sunday, and I know I can really try to set-up dreaming without 'missing the day'. Even then, of course, reaching the energy body via dreaming is hit or miss. First, you must reach lucid dreaming, and from there you must intend to leave the lucid dream and wind up in the energy body back in your room, which doesn't always work. Which of course is the entire flaw of dreaming and why everyone in this sub recommends **Darkroom**.\n\nTo back that up, and to stay with the intent of this sub, I also don't recommend the dreaming path for anyone. I was dreaming like this before I found Carlos' books. If you're going to try to become a sorcerer, TRY TO BECOME ONE WHO CAN DO SORCERY AT WILL, EVERY TIME. Which means mastering **Darkroom**. But if you can't do sorcery at will, what do you really got? Just a bunch of tales of power that nobody really gives a shit about.\n\nAlso, as you may have picked up from the books, dreamers are moody as fuck. Seriously. I'm moody. I have to recap constantly to keep my dreaming moods from overtaking me into depression. Maybe I have that permanent dent in my shell from pulling it close so often (or maybe the dent was there first, which is why dreaming comes naturally), but I'm lucky with my partner.

You can go elsewhere and learn all the Nagualism you want, including the books.  But if you're curious WHY this sub is so \"intent on its own intent\", lets dive deeper:\n\nIt's indulgence.\n\nIt happens to every group, every time.  Without fail.  Self indulgence. \n\nDoes this sub need hundreds, or even thousands of people coming in and posting about their self-indulgent dreams, drug-fueled trips, meditations sessions, clogging the feed with bullshit 'tales of power'?  No, it would dirty the link to intent of the sub, which again, is darkroom.  So if you come here and start doing that, you'll get your post removed.  I've travelled in the double over a hundred times but I can't post about it, or I'll get attacked.  So for the most part I keep my mouth shut unless I reach a crossroads and really need some assistance, in which case I bite the bullet, relate my experience,  ask my question, and hope for some useful advice.  That's the price that comes with this sub.  You have to respect its intent, and take strides not to muddy it. \n\nIt can be frustrating, but it can also be amusing over time, watching dan or the mods or others go off on people who are clearly just bad players.   \n\nWhen you talk about freedom, I wonder what you think that means?  True freedom, is reducing self-importance, storing energy, attaining silence, and eventually reaching the energy body to travel through infinity.  All of those practices are discussed here.\n\nAnd of course, the ultimate freedom, if you believe it can be done, is at death, darting past the Eagle, crossing over into the energy body and essentially becoming an IOB.  That road is available to .000000000000001 of us who will ever practice.   If you want to increase those odds, you better figure out the intent of your own practice.  So don't hate on this sub because they've figure out their own intent and fight to keep it clean. \n\nLackadaisically reaching for Buddhism, or Kabbalah, or going a la carte and creating some generalized pastiche simply muddles the picture.  For me, the second I found Nagualism, it was like everything else was a fucking joke.  You don't need anything else.  Nagualism is a complete cognitive system that doesn't need to be added to, or 'fixed' or enhanced by some chakra bullshit.  If that chakra bullshit works for you, then why are you here?  And if you're here, why be so keen to bring in something that you haven't gotten to work for you? You can't have it both ways.  \n\nThe one thing I will say, is I wish there was more guidance for how to move in the energy body once you reach it, because that is where my practice resides.  However, if I'm being honest, I'm not sure anybody here is reaching the energy body anyway.  Dan's description of his darkroom practices do not align with anything that I experience in the double; I believe what darkroom teaches is 'seeing', and being able to open portals to other worlds, whether completely immersive, or simply appearing on your hand, or on the walls of your room.  However, my guess is, once you enter those worlds, you can then learn to reach the energy body, the same way I do when leaving a lucid dream and reaching it.  The difference?  Repeatability.  I cannot repeat my methods at will, thus their glaring flaw.  Darkroom, apparently, can be repeated at will, since it is done awake.  The counter argument is of course that by this sub's own admission, only a handful out of 7000+ might pull off darkroom successfully.   \n\nSo, hopefully, this clears up a little for you what's happening in this sub:  it's not \"weird\" like you say, it just has a very clean link to its own intent that you are bouncing off of.  And that intent was set by someone who, after spending  years dreaming, and hanging out with self-indulgent ego-fueled sorcery students, decided that Darkroom was the single best way to teach sorcery to the most people, effectively, without the muddling interference of people spewing their own tales of power and one-off experiences.  If you want to read about those, you can go to the lucid dreaming and astral projection subs, and if you want to a la carte piece together some other version of all this that you make up yourself, go ahead and visit all the various religious texts and websites. \n\nBut when you talk about the 'full philosophy' of the books, and you being someone who has read them all repeatedly, what can you possibly be talking about?  The books are all over the place, and I wonder if you could articulate that full philosophy even if you tried?

You can go elsewhere and learn all the Nagualism you want, including the books.  But if you&amp;#39;re curious WHY this sub is so &amp;quot;intent on its own intent&amp;quot;, lets dive deeper:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It happens to every group, every time.  Without fail.  Self indulgence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does this sub need hundreds, or even thousands of people coming in and posting about their self-indulgent dreams, drug-fueled trips, meditations sessions, clogging the feed with bullshit &amp;#39;tales of power&amp;#39;?  No, it would dirty the link to intent of the sub, which again, is darkroom.  So if you come here and start doing that, you&amp;#39;ll get your post removed.  I&amp;#39;ve travelled in the double over a hundred times but I can&amp;#39;t post about it, or I&amp;#39;ll get attacked.  So for the most part I keep my mouth shut unless I reach a crossroads and really need some assistance, in which case I bite the bullet, relate my experience,  ask my question, and hope for some useful advice.  That&amp;#39;s the price that comes with this sub.  You have to respect its intent, and take strides not to muddy it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can be frustrating, but it can also be amusing over time, watching dan or the mods or others go off on people who are clearly just bad players.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you talk about freedom, I wonder what you think that means?  True freedom, is reducing self-importance, storing energy, attaining silence, and eventually reaching the energy body to travel through infinity.  All of those practices are discussed here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, the ultimate freedom, if you believe it can be done, is at death, darting past the Eagle, crossing over into the energy body and essentially becoming an IOB.  That road is available to .000000000000001 of us who will ever practice.   If you want to increase those odds, you better figure out the intent of your own practice.  So don&amp;#39;t hate on this sub because they&amp;#39;ve figure out their own intent and fight to keep it clean. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lackadaisically reaching for Buddhism, or Kabbalah, or going a la carte and creating some generalized pastiche simply muddles the picture.  For me, the second I found Nagualism, it was like everything else was a fucking joke.  You don&amp;#39;t need anything else.  Nagualism is a complete cognitive system that doesn&amp;#39;t need to be added to, or &amp;#39;fixed&amp;#39; or enhanced by some chakra bullshit.  If that chakra bullshit works for you, then why are you here?  And if you&amp;#39;re here, why be so keen to bring in something that you haven&amp;#39;t gotten to work for you? You can&amp;#39;t have it both ways.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one thing I will say, is I wish there was more guidance for how to move in the energy body once you reach it, because that is where my practice resides.  However, if I&amp;#39;m being honest, I&amp;#39;m not sure anybody here is reaching the energy body anyway.  Dan&amp;#39;s description of his darkroom practices do not align with anything that I experience in the double; I believe what darkroom teaches is &amp;#39;seeing&amp;#39;, and being able to open portals to other worlds, whether completely immersive, or simply appearing on your hand, or on the walls of your room.  However, my guess is, once you enter those worlds, you can then learn to reach the energy body, the same way I do when leaving a lucid dream and reaching it.  The difference?  Repeatability.  I cannot repeat my methods at will, thus their glaring flaw.  Darkroom, apparently, can be repeated at will, since it is done awake.  The counter argument is of course that by this sub&amp;#39;s own admission, only a handful out of 7000+ might pull off darkroom successfully.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, hopefully, this clears up a little for you what&amp;#39;s happening in this sub:  it&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; like you say, it just has a very clean link to its own intent that you are bouncing off of.  And that intent was set by someone who, after spending  years dreaming, and hanging out with self-indulgent ego-fueled sorcery students, decided that Darkroom was the single best way to teach sorcery to the most people, effectively, without the muddling interference of people spewing their own tales of power and one-off experiences.  If you want to read about those, you can go to the lucid dreaming and astral projection subs, and if you want to a la carte piece together some other version of all this that you make up yourself, go ahead and visit all the various religious texts and websites. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you talk about the &amp;#39;full philosophy&amp;#39; of the books, and you being someone who has read them all repeatedly, what can you possibly be talking about?  The books are all over the place, and I wonder if you could articulate that full philosophy even if you tried?  Or, instead of trying to figure  that out, you could simply do what they&amp;#39;ve done here: distill all of that information down into one key piece of the puzzle: Zuleica&amp;#39;s teachings in the darkroom, and build from there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And by the way, the complimentary pieces to darkroom are discussed &lt;strong&gt;all the time&lt;/strong&gt; here, including but not limited to: stalking, recapitulation, silence, and tensegrity (magical passes).

Sprinkled all throughout.\n\nIt's basically just \"seeing\".\n\nBut we never connected the dots from \"seeing\", to \"the old seers\" and their bizarre magical abilities.\n\nSuch as the ability for two old seers to sit in a cave, visualize dream objects in the air, carefully matching one person's version to the other, and then to ultimately create a new, stable, phantom reality they can share with others.\n\nIt seems impossible, even when you can move your assemblage point to \"the shift below\".\n\nBecause any \"interest\" in the extreme magic of that region where your assemblage point has moved all the way down your back, causes it to move back up to the top.\n\nYou start to think of \"show biz\", and all the attention you can get, with your new found magical powers.\n\nThe only way to avoid that in \"the shift below\" is to shift your assemblage point far sideways at the same time, so that you're a bit \"confused\" and no longer think about writing your own book.\n\nBut that confusion of having your assemblage point shifted far sideways, to stabilize the magic of the \"shift below\", spoils your ability to experiment with it.\n\nAnd if you don't shift it, then paying too much attention to the magical sights makes them go away.\n\nThat's no longer true in \"Silent Knowledge\", where your assemblage point has changed sides on the body, and comes into alignment with that of your \"energy body\". Which will form all by itself, if you manage to start moving your assemblage point that far.\n\nTo do so REQUIRES that you get rid of that internal dialogue. ALL of it.\n\nAnd that's what drives the energy body away in the first place.\n\nSo that in Silent Knowledge, your energy body becomes as useful as Dr. Strange's Cloak.\n\nMaybe even a bit more powerful.\n\nI have to admit that the energy body is a bit more blurry than this picture shows, when it \"swarms\" away from your body. To which it clings to form the \"blue ball of energy\".\n\nBut it creates sharp detailed objects at times, so I suppose you could teach it to go \"EuroMagick\" for you, like this shows. Drawn by Dall-E artificial intelligence.\n\nI was surprised when it duplicated Dr. Strange himself, seeing as how they're deadly afraid of lawsuits. It refused the first try at drawing this for me.\n\nBut if I didn't get Dr. Strange himself, I'd probably have gotten Gandalf. Like the one it drew for building a phantom room from magical objects.\n\nI was kind of disappointed when Gandalf turned out to be having sex with Dumbledore, in one of the prequels.\n\nBut also slightly relieved, because that made the sexual antics of Carlos' inner circle look practically Catholic.\n\nNow where did Gandalf put that darned wand???\n\nCholita could tell you!\n\nAnd would...\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Jackpot!", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"56zm1qwf4djc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/56zm1qwf4djc1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0b7deb25dabb5d8d736b44dbe3e2b8f4e585e5b"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/56zm1qwf4djc1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=707d41188d889aadc5f030767375c1eb15489f87"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/56zm1qwf4djc1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0cf02d6f7d1a49fc1f96e5f4e977fb8953c393a"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/56zm1qwf4djc1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81f87296c28528a59693a3257e5ad6a16591194e"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/56zm1qwf4djc1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffdbeb0913b8dcfeecd0e4de0caaf35c57f69296"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/56zm1qwf4djc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b03c8eec4d729fdee90e63fbe82dc917f1b09874"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/56zm1qwf4djc1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcf8f3e5428fce8bc1a08ae72fef028f209e9ce5"}, "id": "56zm1qwf4djc1"}}, "name": "t3_1atvu3r", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 25, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 25, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/7GiqPcQ1AUCU1jLtc0R7-FqYEYB1xzBXBdn-bn6qaOI.jpg", "edited": 1708270264.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1708268043.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/56zm1qwf4djc1.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dcf8f3e5428fce8bc1a08ae72fef028f209e9ce5\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/56zm1qwf4djc1.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dcf8f3e5428fce8bc1a08ae72fef028f209e9ce5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;JACKPOT!&amp;quot; is what you&amp;#39;ll be saying to yourself, if you reach Silent Knowledge daily for months and begin to discover how it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We read all about that in the books.

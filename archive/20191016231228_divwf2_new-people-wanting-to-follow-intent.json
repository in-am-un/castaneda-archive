You're the victim of the day.\n\nStopping the world doesn\u2019t make you feel fine. \n\nIt\u2019s rather disturbing in fact.\n\nBut you get a sense of optimism, as you would from any important hobby if you\u2019d done something that requires advanced skills.\n\nThe \"path with heart\" is merely the chance to feel optimistic all the time.\n\nAnd being in heightened awareness makes you feel blissful, but you get used to it.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten into some drag down knock out arguments with Cholita, while in heightened awareness.  \n\nSo bliss doesn\u2019t even give you patience.  Zen masters are famous for being very poor  husbands.  Not only do they lose patience with their wives, but they feel entitled to chastise them as much as they want.  \n\nThey're enlightened!  So they're always right.\n\n\"The Nagual\" everyone wants back (the second attention's energy body) is rather creepy.  \n\nIt\u2019s not cozy, so if you think you\u2019re going to hug it, forget it.  It's inhuman.\n\nAll in all, I believe it's fair to say, sorcerers still suffer from the same little problems as other people. The sorcery doesn\u2019t fix their problems.\n\nIf they have an advantage, it\u2019s not being too lazy to fix theirs, and other people's, problems. \n\nIn silence, you can work like a Zen Monk initiate at the most horrible Monastery in Japan, where they literally work you to death.  \n\nAlso, if you are silent most of the time, your internal dialogue isn\u2019t stuck in a suffering loop.\n\nBut you\u2019ll still suffer. Cholita gives me absolute misery at times.  Two days ago she got angry in a distant shopping mall parking lot, and jumped into a car and took off.\n\nI have no idea who picked her up.  She just showed up at my home when I got back.\n\nIt messed me up energetically in such a painful way, I doubt non-sorcerers can even imagine it.  After a full day of suffering over it, it then took all night for my stomach muscles to relax.\n\nSo forget about being a saint.  \n\nRemember Carol Tigg's prayer to God, to give her endless suffering?\n\nThat's closer to sorcery, than sainthood is. \n\nWhen Carlos was finally dying, perhaps 2 weeks before it actually happened, he had the Chacmools lock us in at Dance Home, alone.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the excuse was, but in fact he wanted to talk to me.\n\nHe said he was dying, and no one believed him.\n\nI guess he wanted a witness to be able to tell people, yes, he really died. \n\nHe told me so himself.  \n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, somewhere slightly before that, he gave me the famous Kung Fu movie gag, a \"half a pear\".

You&amp;#39;re the victim of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stopping the world doesn\u2019t make you feel fine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s rather disturbing in fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you get a sense of optimism, as you would from any important hobby if you\u2019d done something that requires advanced skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;path with heart&amp;quot; is merely the chance to feel optimistic all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And being in heightened awareness makes you feel blissful, but you get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve gotten into some drag down knock out arguments with Cholita, while in heightened awareness.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So bliss doesn\u2019t even give you patience.  Zen masters are famous for being very poor  husbands.  Not only do they lose patience with their wives, but they feel entitled to chastise them as much as they want.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re enlightened!  So they&amp;#39;re always right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Nagual&amp;quot; everyone wants back (the second attention&amp;#39;s energy body) is rather creepy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not cozy, so if you think you\u2019re going to hug it, forget it.  It&amp;#39;s inhuman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, I believe it&amp;#39;s fair to say, sorcerers still suffer from the same little problems as other people. The sorcery doesn\u2019t fix their problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they have an advantage, it\u2019s not being too lazy to fix theirs, and other people&amp;#39;s, problems. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In silence, you can work like a Zen Monk initiate at the most horrible Monastery in Japan, where they literally work you to death.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if you are silent most of the time, your internal dialogue isn\u2019t stuck in a suffering loop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you\u2019ll still suffer. Cholita gives me absolute misery at times.  Two days ago she got angry in a distant shopping mall parking lot, and jumped into a car and took off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea who picked her up.  She just showed up at my home when I got back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It messed me up energetically in such a painful way, I doubt non-sorcerers can even imagine it.  After a full day of suffering over it, it then took all night for my stomach muscles to relax.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So forget about being a saint.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember Carol Tigg&amp;#39;s prayer to God, to give her endless suffering?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s closer to sorcery, than sainthood is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Carlos was finally dying, perhaps 2 weeks before it actually happened, he had the Chacmools lock us in at Dance Home, alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know what the excuse was, but in fact he wanted to talk to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said he was dying, and no one believed him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess he wanted a witness to be able to tell people, yes, he really died. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me so himself.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if that wasn&amp;#39;t enough, somewhere slightly before that, he gave me the famous Kung Fu movie gag, a &amp;quot;half a pear&amp;quot;. In Chinese, it implies a master and student being separated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He made a big deal out of presenting it to me at his Pandora Complex, and then I was told to go home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wanted to make sure the point would remain in my memory as a puzzling mystery I&amp;#39;d tell people, until someone Chinese heard about it and explained it to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He died.

Blank.  \n\nI\u2019m probably going to have to steal that!\n\nI\u2019m not clear on where you encountered one, but let\u2019s talk about inorganic beings being present in dreams.\n\nCarlos didn\u2019t really go into that much.  And even his last book, where he tells how to identify one by staring it down, doesn\u2019t make it clear if that\u2019s good for both waking, and dreaming encounters.\n\nYes, some of those dream characters, especially the persistent ones who want to push up against you,  are actually inorganic beings.  \n\nYour mom?  A childhood school teacher? An evil mix of your mom and a school teacher?\n\nAlmost surely inorganic beings, if they stick around a long time.\n\nI guess Carlos never mentioned that in classes, because it leads to all kinds of imaginary troubles in apprentices.  We have those lecture notes where he told one woman that her too long description of her dream meant it likely came from the liver.\n\nHe was doing a bit of stalking in those lecture notes. \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just her.  He almost surely got sick of listening to long explanations of the wonderful dream someone had last night, being surrounded by so many apprentices as he was.\n\nAny of you who try to teach lucid dreaming to friends will be familiar with the long accounts they come back with, of ordinary dreams.   \n\nThey miss the key point: lucidity.  That\u2019s the reason for looking at the hands.  Proof of lucidity.\n\nMaybe the long tales of ordinary dreams, is why Carlos put the kibosh on giving us more details about what\u2019s really present in our dreams.\n\nSince he never mentioned it, how do I know they\u2019re inorganic beings?\n\nBecause the darned things can follow you out into the waking world!\n\nThat pretty much qualifies for me.\n\nIn a dream, you might say, we\u2019ll, that\u2019s just like a video.  It\u2019s all coming from your mind.  So it\u2019s crazy to think some of the characters are real.\n\nBut when they follow you out and are standing there, with you awake now and sitting up on the bed in horror, that\u2019s definitely an \u201cinorganic being\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a being, with no organic body.  \n\nDoesn\u2019t have to be the little smoke, or the lizard ally or something so wonderful that us mere mortals will never encounter one.\n\nAnd the flow of allies between waking and dreaming goes both ways.\n\nCarlos allies have followed me into dreaming a number of times.\n\n It\u2019s always horribly frightening, and one wouldn\u2019t even think to use the word, \u201cblank\u201d to describe such an encounter.\n\nAnd yet, that\u2019s what they are, if you calm down and watch them without fear.\n\nSomeone in here coined the phrase (which I also stole), \u201clow energy inorganic being\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s all I suspect you\u2019ll find, until I find a way to share Carlos\u2019 allies with people who make good progress.  \n\nThat means, the ones you encounter will likely be a lot less scarier than the ones I\u2019ve seen.\n\nWhat advantage can you get from low energy inorganic beings in dreaming?\n\nJust hang out with them. They\u2019re presence stabilizes the dream.  \n\nThey want the energy released by your emotions.  \n\nYou want their dark energy.\n\nIt\u2019s a good arrangement.\n\nThe main problem you have then, is to retain your sense of purpose.\n\nYour lucidity will get messed up by interacting with them.  But it\u2019ll probably last longer than if you just went off on your own.\n\nSo the first time you become lucid and realize you\u2019ve been sitting next to someone and conversing with them for a while, but then you realize they never actually said anything, it was all you, just keep it going.  \n\nDon\u2019t get up and leave.  See what happens.\n\nBut if you wake up in a dream and are in some kind of hostile situation with a dreaming character, that\u2019s when it\u2019s a good idea to force them to change.\n\nThe technique Carlos gave was to stare at them, until they either go away (or turn into a pile of clothes perhaps), or they change into a bar of light.\n\nIt works! In both waking and dreaming.   I\u2019ve done it a few times.\n\nBut don\u2019t do that unless you\u2019re new to it, and merely want to see if it works. \n\nInstead, just stare until they start to mutate. Then keep your eye on them just enough so that they can\u2019t slip off, but don\u2019t stare anymore. Point your finger right at them and order them to change into whatever you like.\n\nOnce you learn to do that (it\u2019s actually easy), you can select a form that makes a good \u201ccompanion\u201d, for hunting energy.  \n\nI once ordered a troublesome dreaming character to change, giving it no suggestions as to what form it might take.\n\nIt changed into a 15 year old girl I encountered in Laguna Beach.  \n\nThere was an art exhibit on top of the roof of a restaurant. It consisted of teenagers with little booths, selling their art.\n\nSome of it was pretty good.  And there was a moody looking, post goth teenage girl around 15 years old, selling amazing pencil drawings of herself naked.\n\nI was impressed. What a good gimmick!\n\nExcept, if I\u2019d bought one, I\u2019d  have to worry about going to jail.\n\nThe inorganic seems to have found that image in my mind.  Or whatever they do. Maybe I projected it onto the inorganic.\n\nBut there she was in my dream.  \n\nShe obeyed and followed me around for a good half hour, but then I noticed, she was mutating over time.\n\nShe had a big scar on her cheek, which was sewn up with metal wires.  And she\u2019d done a costume change.\n\nI had to ask her to refresh her image.  Her appearance had become a little disturbing. \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I woke up.  I couldn\u2019t hold that dream, once I interrupted the flow.

These come from my memory of Carlos\u2019 books and his private classes.\n\n**Affirmations** from the world around us, told to Carlos almost immediately in his book sequence,  provides the knowledge that something is indeed watching us, and is interested in our doings.\n\nThat\u2019s *intent*.  Carlos was introduced to *intent* right off the bat.  And also to searching for colors in the darkness, when he was looking for his \"spot\".\n\nSo those who claim the books evolved, and Carlos added stuff he stole from elsewhere, ought to go back and read with some understanding.\n\nAs far as I can tell, nothing's changed from the first book, to the last one.  If anyone had used the first book or two to their full potential, they wouldn't have needed the rest.\n\n**Omens** are rather obvious.  I can't quite get excited over a squawking crow the way Europeans did back then (our crows look different than their ravens).  But this gives you the knowledge that *intent* can provide hints along the way.    It's not just for free fabulous prizes, or burdensome tasks.\n\n**Plucking** your \u201ccubic centimeter of chance\u201d teaches us to be on the lookout for opportunities given to us by *intent*.\n\nCarlos used to give out potential assignments to see if anyone took him up on it. Each time no one would, and when asked about it the next day he\u2019d say, \u201cIt\u2019s too late now\u201d.\n\nHe did that at least a few times, until we were always listening to see if we could pick up a new offer.\n\nThere was palpable frustration at not being able to take him up on his offers.\n\nSometimes it was because no one realized it was in fact an offer.  It wasn't obvious until he explained it to us the next day, and chastised us for not taking him up.\n\nBut eventually they got very specific.  Right in your eye specific!\n\nFor example, walk the 120 miles from Dance Home to San Diego, and start right now.\n\nNo one took him up on it. They had other obligations.\n\nI pulled out my credit card and told everyone not to worry.\n\nIt was pre-cellphone days. No uber, lift or airb&amp;b if you got into trouble.  But hotel rooms were present along the path.\n\nStill, no one agreed to come along.\n\nOne of the more attractive women, who hadn't yet cut her hair,  stood nearby and said apologetically, \"I have a husband.\"\n\nAnother nodded her head as she held it low in embarrassment.\n\n\"Boyfriend\", she mumbled.  \"I can't.\"\n\n(Boyfriends didn't like Carlos, as Cholita has explained to me.)\n\nNo men were to be found in that discussion.   They pranced off, as if they were going to plan something big on their own.\n\nBut they never did.\n\nI'll add that account to my understanding of male vs female practitioners.\n\nEveryone carries a bubble of perception with them, wherever they go. It's what makes them feel, \"normal\".\n\nSorcerers have no bubble (shields).  But normal people always do.\n\nThe women can take their bubble along, even for a 120 mile trek on foot,  if they're with someone they trust.\n\nTheir bubbles are just fine, thank you.  And expandable!\n\nThe men have a harder time.\n\n(bad puns in there somewhere).\n\nAnother point for the women!\n\nCarlos  finally started calling this process of accepting an assignment, \u201c**Jumping**\u201d.\n\nHe meant, you hear of an opportunity.  A chance to have a chance.  And you have to decide to take it, or decline it.\n\nOften the opportunity is too stupid to believe! You\u2019d have to be nuts to take it seriously.\n\nFor example, Cholita. My response to Cholita showing up homeless in my garage was, \u201cJust what I needed! A partner to test shared dreaming. Thank you *intent*!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t think, \u201cParanoid schizophrenics are the worst type of person to care for!  It\u2019s heartbreaking,  and leads to nervous breakdowns\u201d.\n\nInstead, I \u201cjumped\u201d.\n\nAnd now I have Cholita tossing my stuff out the car window while she rants about the blood in Washington and the rapists.\n\nBut she's also teaching me how to assemble dreams in my bedroom, not just other worlds.    Last night she almost gave me permission to pull her along.\n\nThat\u2019s following *intent*, as opposed to pursuing happiness.\n\nThe pursuit of happiness is a short-sighted endeavor.\n\nLet me put a stormtrooper spin on this, just in case I'm looking too much like an impeccable warrior.\n\nWhat was I thinking when I pulled out my credit card?  I was thinking, here's 2 of the hottest babes in the class, flirting with the idea of staying in hotel rooms with me for the next 2 or 3 days.  And their hair is uncut, so they aren't off limits.\n\nThat's ok!  You get to think things like that, so don't feel defiled. Seriously. Don't beat yourself up over the impeccable thing.\n\nAlso, people were frantic to be the first to take Carlos up on his offers to \"jump\", because it would get them lots of attention and face time, in Carlos' lectures.\n\nOne of the wayward women, who typically was hid from view for the most part, seems to have taken him up on an offer.\n\nRumors said she did, but only the women knew what actually went on...\n\nAnother point for the women?

I spent a lot of time wondering how man, before he had language, thoughts, survived. I was taking a shower and I was suddenly looking at a great ape, from a time period when we first learned language. I mentioned it in a prior post. The creature was very high energy, extremely animated and very much in the moment. It&amp;#39;s fur was short and reddish blonde in color.  It was very weird to see the difference between that creature and myself. I was wondering how we had changed so drastically over time and then I &amp;#39;heard&amp;#39; &amp;quot;we behaved&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took a while to wonder how I had seen that, something from the past.\nTime and space exist in this world/universe. The only answer that makes any sense is that my double showed it to me. It answered a question I had not even asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_divwf2", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/divwf2/new_people_wanting_to_follow_intent/fma9fvn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1585887315.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1585887315.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "flgzc8y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_flf0fit", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I can verify now, that beautiful women stir up energy.\n\nIf you take it as all sexual, it's not useful.

Look around, then stare at something, then look around again.    The dream is altered.  If you stare too long you'll either wake up, or be in a completely different dream.\n\nI'd say that this advice sounds nice, and gives someone \"something to do\".  That's the most important thing for learning dreaming. Interacting in it.  \n\nWhat you do isn't nearly as important as behaving as if it were real.\n\nBut if you look at your hands to \"renew\" the energy you need for dreaming, and it's not working as well as this implies, find something to smash. Or someone to push over.\n\nOr even shout, \"Hey, is there anyone here that wants to take me on!!??\"\n\nThe hands thing...  I wouldn\u2019t risk my dreaming time using that to renew the dream. A dream change is much better.\n\n&gt;It's usually ushered in by a dream that many of us have had at one time or another in which one is looking at oneself sleeping in bed.\n\nThis puts a lot of pressure on potential dreamers.  Geez the expectations those books create!\n\nDon\u2019t expect that!  More likely is that on occasion you\u2019ll  have  a hard time waking up, and bounce from dream to dream.   And some of those, especially after several bounces elsewhere, will be in your bedroom.\n\nYou\u2019ll have done what this says, except that it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll turn around to look at yourself. You\u2019ll be more worried about whether it\u2019s real or still a dream.\n\nAnd if you get sober enough in all that panic, to turn around and look, then great.  But you could have used that concentration to do any number of other interesting things.  And more than likely you will.\n\nSo be grateful for whatever you find.\n\n&gt;So, all in all, the procedure to get to the dreaming body is Impeccability in our daily life. G-180-1\n\nYea, but... \n\nThere\u2019s TV, movies, YouTube, Wine, Beer, partying with beautiful young women, dining in expensive restaurants, etc.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to become a monk.  \n\nIn fact, becoming a monk (in their own mind) did in a good portion of the private class students.\n\nI\u2019ve got an idea. Be an impeccable warrior monk, but as a stalking maneuver be a selfish bastard and do whatever the hell you want.\n\nIt\u2019s good practice in stalking!\n\nAs an aside, Cholita went through some old CDs she had, and found one she wanted me to rip.\n\nI couldn't help but pay very close attention, because she'd just demonstrated her belly dancing skills.

Look around, then stare at something, then look around again.    The dream is altered.  If you stare too long you&amp;#39;ll either wake up, or be in a completely different dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say that this advice sounds nice, and gives someone &amp;quot;something to do&amp;quot;.  That&amp;#39;s the most important thing for learning dreaming. Interacting in it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you do isn&amp;#39;t nearly as important as behaving as if it were real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you look at your hands to &amp;quot;renew&amp;quot; the energy you need for dreaming, and it&amp;#39;s not working as well as this implies, find something to smash. Or someone to push over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or even shout, &amp;quot;Hey, is there anyone here that wants to take me on!!??&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hands thing...  I wouldn\u2019t risk my dreaming time using that to renew the dream. A dream change is much better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s usually ushered in by a dream that many of us have had at one time or another in which one is looking at oneself sleeping in bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This puts a lot of pressure on potential dreamers.  Geez the expectations those books create!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t expect that!  More likely is that on occasion you\u2019ll  have  a hard time waking up, and bounce from dream to dream.   And some of those, especially after several bounces elsewhere, will be in your bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll have done what this says, except that it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll turn around to look at yourself. You\u2019ll be more worried about whether it\u2019s real or still a dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you get sober enough in all that panic, to turn around and look, then great.  But you could have used that concentration to do any number of other interesting things.  And more than likely you will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So be grateful for whatever you find.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, all in all, the procedure to get to the dreaming body is Impeccability in our daily life.

Like, what you mentioned. \n\nTo learn dreaming and to participate in the warriors way is abstract. Wanting a new refrigerator is not.\n\nUnless you need that new fridge in order to accomplish something else, which is abstract.\n\nOnce you have the abstract desire, you go outside and shout \"Intent!!!\" to the sky, to set it in motion.  \n\nIt\u2019s a good thing you have to do that too! Imagine if intent was reading our minds, and tried to help with any abstract thought we had.\n\nAre beautiful women abstract? If they were, I\u2019d be doomed.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a little shy about shouting \u201cIntent!!!\u201d in public, so I do it on the freeway when I go through the underpass. That doesn\u2019t seem to weaken the effect.\n\nAnd driving is a good time to practice silence, so you can be a \u201cfreeway warrior\u201d if you feel inclined.\n\nCarlos actually had us shout \u201cIntent!!!\u201d, so don\u2019t think it\u2019s just for psychological effect. There really seems to be some conscious force in the universe that wants to play the game with us. \n\nOr if there isn\u2019t, then it\u2019s a magnificent not-doing, and will work all the same. It could turn out in the long run, that our own Nagual is behind everything.\n\nSome in here have seen the amazing coincidences that happen once you engage intent. Plus you can learn to manifest objects with it! \n\nAnd no, so far they don\u2019t stick around for me. Forget the gold bars for now. But manifesting objects is still amazing.\n\nHow many times to shout Intent? Does more than 1 make it stronger?\n\nI would think not, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no harm if you want to shout it several times.\n\nThere was the time when Carlos made fun of one woman whom he claimed was out in the backyard at Pandora, shouting \u201cIntent!!!!\u201d all night like a cat in heat.\n\nMy guess: She shouted it a few times instead of 1, to get more attention. And Carlos was having a little trouble with her, but liked her.\n\nSo he exaggerated her into a story for the private class. She got praise and criticism at the same time.\n\nI think she\u2019s also the ant lady.\n\nNow that I mentioned that, go find some tiny ants, and lie naked in their path. Add some chaos to the mix, and you might please intent. It likes humour.\n\nFinding hands: You can borrow energy from someone who is enthusiastic, and tells you about it. That's good for a 1 nighter.\n\nIn other words, it's not useful, but it gives anyone interested a taste.\n\nIntent is like that. Sometimes it gives you a taste of something wonderful, and you think to yourself, \u201cI\u2019m all set now!\u201d\n\nBut you aren\u2019t. It was just a one time gift. You have to work for more.\n\nTo get dreaming, I can think of 2 methods that are workable (but not easy).\n\nYou can completely disrupt your life so that it\u2019s all jumbled up, and you aren\u2019t doing what you usually do.\n\nThat releases a little unused energy. As it turns out, we live off the energy of the position of our assemblage point.  When you learn to move it, you\u2019ll discover what that energy feels like.\n\nI have a theory that we die, because we use up all the positions we have access to. We get weaker and weaker as we age, because we\u2019ve almost used it all.\n\nAnd people who engage in more unusual activities seem to remain youthful longer. \n\nBut it\u2019s just my theory. Carlos never said so.\n\nSo aside from getting yourself tossed into jail, or some other method to completely disrupt your routines, you can try to mess with them gently.\n\nGo left instead of right. Have vanilla instead of chocolate. \n\nDon\u2019t try to get in the last word.\n\nAll of those will help a little. But silence is the best method that I know of. \n\nWhen your internal dialogue is reduced, you gain energy.\n\nThat gives you many more chances to find your hands in dreaming. \n\nDon\u2019t doubt that things will change if you learn to reduce that internal dialogue.\n\nI have a person writing to me who\u2019s pretty much a bad man. It\u2019s sort of hard to read what he thinks about things.\n\nBut I don\u2019t judge personalities, or I\u2019d just go sit in a corner and cry. I\u2019m autistic, so who am I to say what\u2019s ok behavior?\n\nFortunately, he learned to get silent and his bad personality changed. \n\nPretty soon I\u2019ll have to call him \u201cSaint Bob\u201d.\n\nAs a result, he got far more dreaming. He saved all the energy we use up, hating everyone and feeling sorry for ourselves all day.\n\nHe learned to get silent by sitting in a chair, trying to curtail his internal dialogue as best he could.\n\nMy advice on that is FORCE yourself silent, if you can manage that.\n\nIf you can\u2019t, then do it gently, but for a longer time. \n\nLike 1 hour the first time. You have to get over the idea that you\u2019re too precious to spend your time on such a senseless task. When you stop looking at the clock, you\u2019re almost there.\n\nThat\u2019s what he did. I had to listen to complaints about 20 minutes being so long at first.\n\nBut eventually he stopped watching the time. And he naturally got bored doing that, fell asleep, his head bobbed down, and he woke back up.\n\nI\u2019d alerted him to watch for the transition in the middle. That\u2019s where you want to be.\n\nHe repeated it over and over, until he found that place in the middle.\n\nThat\u2019s where dreaming is active while you are awake. It\u2019s the \u201csecond attention\u201d.\n\nIf you want dreaming, you need to learn what that is as fast as possible.\n\nLearn what the second attention is, and you\u2019ll also learn what the assemblage point is.\n\nMyself, I would have wanted to enter dreaming directly from that place.\n\nBut he just remained at that level. He seemed to enjoy just swimming in it.\n\nDespite not learning to do dreaming awake from there, by choice, he still got the benefit.\n\nIt activated many more chances to find his hands in dreaming.\n\nOnce you find your hands, you MUST learn to change dreams. Right away!\n\nDon\u2019t find your hands, then look around and say, \u201cThis is really cool! I\u2019m going to have to write a story about it, and tell all of my friends!\u201d\n\nIf you do, time is up. You\u2019ll wake up.\n\nInstead, if you find your hands you have to say, \u201cHoly Shit! I\u2019ve only got a few more seconds. I\u2019d better change dreams fast!\u201d\n\nI wrote about how to change dreams in many places. If you don\u2019t know any methods, let me know.\n\nBut you could sum up what you need to do in dreaming, by thinking about those coconut traps for monkeys.\n\nThey make a hole small enough that the monkey can just barely squeeze his hand in there. And they put rice in the coconut.\n\nThe monkey grabs the rice, but can\u2019t get his hand out. And he\u2019s too greedy to let go of the rice.\n\nYou have to be like that monkey in dreaming. Too stubborn to let go. \n\nOnce you learn to hold on and change dreams so that you have unlimited time, you\u2019ll eventually conquer the gates of dreaming.\n\nBut it takes a positive effort. You can\u2019t just wait around to find your hands. \n\nNo one seems to have ever done good at that. There\u2019s just no reason to expect our dull consciousness to wake up in a dream, unless we do something while awake to make it more alert and energetic.\n\nUnwarranted Depression and Anxiety are mostly a result of the internal dialogue. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a bio-chemical component, but our biology seems to regulate better when we get a taste of the Nagual once in a while.\n\nIf I go without gazing in darkness for too many days, I start to feel less than wonderful. I get fussy and uncomfortable.\n\nBut if I get a taste of the nagual at night, then I\u2019m high all day. I can even work continuously for many hours, like a Zen monk being hazed by a master.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even occur to me to feel sorry for myself, if I had that taste of the nagual, and maintain silence while working.\n\nYou\u2019ll get high from that as in, you just won the lottery and your old girlfriend is coming for a visit.\n\nThose highs are mental. They\u2019re caused by an idea in your mind.\n\nThe nagual is even more effective at producing that high. It\u2019s more than just an idea in your mind.\n\nConsuming too much time on YouTube?\n\nGot a good porn channel you\u2019d recommend? I just got internet at home, for Cholita. And I\u2019m amazed at what kids in junior high get to watch these days.\n\nBut don\u2019t cut out entertainment in order to be a \u201cwarrior\u201d! \n\nCholita got that idea from private classes. And she also cut out candy, coffee, alcohol, and shopping at reasonably priced grocery stores.\n\nShe\u2019s a Whole Foods saint!\n\nAnd yet, last night after filling 2 shopping carts,  she was shouting how much she despises me in the shopping mall parking lot. And cursing at passersby for stealing her stuff.\n\nBeing a \u201csaint\u201d didn\u2019t work out for her.\n\nJust watch the TV, eat the bad stuff, but practice. \n\nJust practice. \n\nThose things are only bad because they tend to use up all of our practice time.\n\nIf they don\u2019t, then they\u2019re fine.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_f428la5", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You start with intent by wanting something abstract. Like, what you mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To learn dreaming and to participate in the warriors way is abstract. Wanting a new refrigerator is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you need that new fridge in order to accomplish something else, which is abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have the abstract desire, you go outside and shout &amp;quot;Intent!!!&amp;quot; to the sky, to set it in motion.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a good thing you have to do that too! Imagine if intent was reading our minds, and tried to help with any abstract thought we had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are beautiful women abstract? If they were, I\u2019d be doomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve always been a little shy about shouting \u201cIntent!!!\u201d in public, so I do it on the freeway when I go through the underpass. That doesn\u2019t seem to weaken the effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And driving is a good time to practice silence, so you can be a \u201cfreeway warrior\u201d if you feel inclined.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos actually had us shout \u201cIntent!!!\u201d, so don\u2019t think it\u2019s just for psychological effect. There really seems to be some conscious force in the universe that wants to play the game with us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if there isn\u2019t, then it\u2019s a magnificent not-doing, and will work all the same. It could turn out in the long run, that our own Nagual is behind everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some in here have seen the amazing coincidences that happen once you engage intent. Plus you can learn to manifest objects with it! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no, so far they don\u2019t stick around for me. Forget the gold bars for now. But manifesting objects is still amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How many times to shout Intent? Does more than 1 make it stronger?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would think not, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no harm if you want to shout it several times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was the time when Carlos made fun of one woman whom he claimed was out in the backyard at Pandora, shouting \u201cIntent!!!!\u201d all night like a cat in heat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess: She shouted it a few times instead of 1, to get more attention. And Carlos was having a little trouble with her, but liked her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he exaggerated her into a story for the private class. She got praise and criticism at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think she\u2019s also the ant lady.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I mentioned that, go find some tiny ants, and lie naked in their path. Add some chaos to the mix, and you might please intent. It likes humour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finding hands: You can borrow energy from someone who is enthusiastic, and tells you about it. That&amp;#39;s good for a 1 nighter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, it&amp;#39;s not useful, but it gives anyone interested a taste.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent is like that. Sometimes it gives you a taste of something wonderful, and you think to yourself, \u201cI\u2019m all set now!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you aren\u2019t. It was just a one time gift. You have to work for more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To get dreaming, I can think of 2 methods that are workable (but not easy).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can completely disrupt your life so that it\u2019s all jumbled up, and you aren\u2019t doing what you usually do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That releases a little unused energy. As it turns out, we live off the energy of the position of our assemblage point.  When you learn to move it, you\u2019ll discover what that energy feels like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a theory that we die, because we use up all the positions we have access to. We get weaker and weaker as we age, because we\u2019ve almost used it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And people who engage in more unusual activities seem to remain youthful longer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it\u2019s just my theory. Carlos never said so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So aside from getting yourself tossed into jail, or some other method to completely disrupt your routines, you can try to mess with them gently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go left instead of right. Have vanilla instead of chocolate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t try to get in the last word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of those will help a little. But silence is the best method that I know of. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When your internal dialogue is reduced, you gain energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gives you many more chances to find your hands in dreaming. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don\u2019t doubt that things will change if you learn to reduce that internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a person writing to me who\u2019s pretty much a bad man. It\u2019s sort of hard to read what he thinks about things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I don\u2019t judge personalities, or I\u2019d just go sit in a corner and cry. I\u2019m autistic, so who am I to say what\u2019s ok behavior?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, he learned to get silent and his bad personality changed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty soon I\u2019ll have to call him \u201cSaint Bob\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, he got far more dreaming. He saved all the energy we use up, hating everyone and feeling sorry for ourselves all day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He learned to get silent by sitting in a chair, trying to curtail his internal dialogue as best he could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My advice on that is FORCE yourself silent, if you can manage that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can\u2019t, then do it gently, but for a longer time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like 1 hour the first time. You have to get over the idea that you\u2019re too precious to spend your time on such a senseless task. When you stop looking at the clock, you\u2019re almost there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s what he did. I had to listen to complaints about 20 minutes being so long at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But eventually he stopped watching the time. And he naturally got bored doing that, fell asleep, his head bobbed down, and he woke back up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d alerted him to watch for the transition in the middle. That\u2019s where you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He repeated it over and over, until he found that place in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s where dreaming is active while you are awake. It\u2019s the \u201csecond attention\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want dreaming, you need to learn what that is as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learn what the second attention is, and you\u2019ll also learn what the assemblage point is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myself, I would have wanted to enter dreaming directly from that place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he just remained at that level. He seemed to enjoy just swimming in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite not learning to do dreaming awake from there, by choice, he still got the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It activated many more chances to find his hands in dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you find your hands, you MUST learn to change dreams.

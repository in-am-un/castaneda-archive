It\u2019s possibly why he also taught it at workshops.  He was hoping people would use it.\n\nYou get a pole, about 1-2 inches in diameter, and put a pad on the end.  Just wrap some leather or strong cloth around the end, with some padding below it,  and tie it off with anything.  String, staples, whatever.  You just want a pad on one end.\n\nLength is up to you, but start out longer and then adjust.  Maybe 2.5 feet.\n\nSit cross legged on the floor and slump forward so that your forehead is on the padded part. Feet are more together than crossed, so that they could actually touch your forehead, if you could bend that low. You keep the stick between the feet, so that the shorter it gets, the closer your feet get to touching your forehead.\n\nForce yourself silent.  Eyes closed is how we did it.  But you could keep them open too. It just might be more difficult.\n\nThe stick keeps your head from slumping onto your chest and hurting when you're done.  Carlos taught us some exercises to help with that pain, but with the stick you don\u2019t need them.\n\nI used to think the stick just helped to focus the attention on what you are doing.  Similar to how he taught us to press stones and crystals between our fingers, while sitting in an armchair, forcing silence.\n\nBut the stick came after that instruction.\n\nYou can also put the pad under your chin for a bit, when you start out.  It's supposed to stimulate something.  I can't recall what.  I used to lay my chin on the end of a table if I didn\u2019t have the stick.\n\nBut the position of the legs is the key thing. It brings the connection between the second attention\u2019s assemblage point, located near your stomach, and the side of the calves, which are another source of perception and awareness.\n\nWith the second attention stimulated by the position of the legs, more is likely to happen when you force silence.\n\nYou\u2019re also in the final position of absorption of the body of the tonal, into the body of the nagual.  Presumably you can vanish in that situation, the way Emilito is said to have done in front of Taisha.\n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of the tonal and nagual terms because they\u2019re abused by me-too naguals.

The important thing was the manner in which the eyes, by being kept slightly crossed and unfocused (not looking at anything directly) kept a peripheral view of eveything on the arc that started at the tip of the feet and ended just above the horizon. He had insisted that if one kept one\u2019s unfocused eyes at that point just above the horizon, it was possible to notice, at once, an enormous number of features of the world in almost the total 180-degree range in front of the eyes, without being clear about them. He added that the eyes in that state were capable of picking out details which were too fleeting for normal vision, and this literally flooded the tonal (first attention), saturating it with information.\" \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you that the internal dialogue is what grounds us,\u201d don Juan said. \u201cThe world is such and such or so and so, only because we talk to ourselves about its being such and such or so and so.

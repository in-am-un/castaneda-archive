The head turning eliminates my concern about falling asleep, and remembering keeps you from blanking out in a non-beneficial way.\n\nTrue, you go \"inside\", something I consider bad for darkroom practices.\n\nBut this is recap! It's all about \"going inside\".\n\nI wish someone would \"specialize\" in this for a while.    I can't afford to.\n\nI'm trying to dive into the green furnace you see in the picture.\n\nThe Abstract.\n\nIt's the passage to the old sorcerers.  Our link, through intent, to them.\n\nOf course you can do that with less of a link, but once you've seen in there it becomes very alluring.\n\nSo let's look at this, from a darkroom gazer's point of view.\n\nYou find an IOB floating head. Or a VERY crusty puff of purple light.\n\nYou recapitulate such that they remain in your view, going back and forth, as in the ping-pong game. In this case, non-directionality is a help.\n\nAnd of course, I missed one example pic in that diagram. I didn't bother to show \"translocation\" during recapitulation, because you probably won't notice that with closed eyes.\n\nJust keep in mind, if you are doing it well, but with eyes open in perfect darkness, translocation is constant, and IOB caves are common.\n\nLikely you'll end up recapitulating in another world. Or at least, another world will be projected all around you.\n\nI recommend you try to brightened up the hypno-head or crusty puff before you use it,  by blowing into it, and inhaling it into you, as you move it out and in.\n\nRemember, we can learn to levitate objects by pushing and pulling on inorganic beings.\n\nI don't know why, but they like that sort of thing.\n\nThe speed at which it brightens up is a little disappointing, but don't let that cause you to give up.\n\nIf you move your hand in and out 10 times and it isn't brighter, but you can still see it, even barely, go ahead and use that.\n\nBut if you hit the jackpot, your IOB manifestation will get what you are about to do, and even come up with a funny new outfit, to make it more entertaining.\n\nThat's what Fancy came up with.  Speak easy times???\n\nHey, Fancy!  I'm not that old.\n\nFancy also could not help but try to scare me a bit. \n\nShe used the old, \"Oh look! My eye is dead and rotting\",  trick.\n\nI must admit (don't tell Fancy), it didn't have any effect. Except maybe it went even better with all the black mascara. \n\nBut I did exclaim, \"Oh, so scary Fancy!  That's wonderful!!!\"\n\nBe sure to talk to your IOB.  It helps.\n\nAs you practice this form of recap, the second attention comes out and you can visually see the scenes.\n\nThe right ones?  I have no idea.  We'll need  a specialist for that.\n\nBut if you can see the scene, please don't analyze it and say to yourself, \"Hey, this is not my beautiful house!  This is not my beautiful wife.\"\n\nJust go with it.  We're really trying to make it to the double.  That's where the real fun happens.\n\nOnce you make it to the double, you might just find intent.\n\nAnd that's the jackpot!\n\nSo if you can visually see the scene, you have the second attention out.\n\nWatching ANYTHING coming from the second attention, while silent, will move the assemblage point.\n\nBut if you are trying to remember, as you do in recap, that's close enough.  Your assemblage point will still shift, but perhaps a bit sideways, more often than you'd like.\n\nIf you start flashing between watching the dream, and being inside (in very fast flashes), good job!\n\nYou moved the assemblage point even further down.\n\nAt some point, the double will materialize next to you, the same way it does in the darkroom.\n\nI used to have it take over my hand, in cases where I was too stupid to notice I was no longer in my own room.\n\nIt never flipped me off for being so stupid I didn't notice I had translocated, but it did like to point rudely at things.\n\nNow here's the problem.\n\nEnergy.\n\nYou don't have enough.  That's the whole point of recap, and if you're practicing this version of it, you haven't done enough yet.  \n\nTo get your energy back that is.\n\nYou'll blank out, enter a dream without lucidity, or forget what even happened.\n\nThat's where darkroom gazing is useful. Walking around, eyes open, you learn to \"take it easy\" when dealing with magic, and you feel as if it's \"perfectly ordinary\".\n\nLast night I was raining down second attention water onto my floor, so I could splash it around with my fingers and find \"Mystery\", my IOB who likes the floor.  He likes to stay under the bed, but the water splashes lure him out. \n\nIt's like an led laser spot luring you cat from under the bed.\n\nExcept, IOBs don't learn it's pointless to chase the shiny red dot.\n\nThe way your cat quickly does.\n\nOr at least, Mystery wants me to believe that for now.  It's a game he plays.\n\nMaybe he's hiding down there, because Fancy likes to be on top.\n\nAt one point I realized, how come I have to stick my hand up into a  yellow raincloud, to get the water to run down to the floor?\n\nIt's nice pandiculation, but how come I can't just make it rise up from below.\n\nI realized, that's what \"Gift to Malibu\" was all about.  Here and there.  Practicing up and down with your gaze.\n\nNow, I have no idea what that means, but I did manage to get 3 inches of water all over my bedroom floor, instead of  the 5 I can get from a yellow cloud.\n\nTry it yourself. Bend your back sharply, without breaking anything, and look as high up as you can.  Even rolls the eyes back.\n\nLook for the \"yellow clouds\".  I can't imagine you won't find them fairly soon.  But the assemblage point has to be in \"brilliant colors and jet black swirls\" mode.\n\nTo go from not having enough energy to move on from entering the scenes,  to being able to connect to past sorcerers lives, may be just a matter of looking inside that furnace of the abstract, without becoming lost.\n\nEnergy.  Each step seems to require more energy.\n\nBut you don't have to get that by flickering sunlight into your eyes for hours each day.\n\nOr even watching the sun go up or down, the way La Catalina did, to get energy.\n\nI believe you can simply build it up by nightly darkroom gazing, without even thinking about what you are doing.\n\nI knew a man who liked to lift heavy weights.  He was going for a certain physical \"look\".\n\n(gay, gay, gay he was).\n\nThen he got a summer job on a farm.\n\nAfterwards he told me, that worked better than lifting weights and he didn't even realize it was building up his muscles.\n\nHe was just helping on a farm.  \n\nI could only picture bails of hay and pitchforks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Accelerated Recapitulation", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Recapitulation"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"qf0t5rs0u5d61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qf0t5rs0u5d61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24844ecde82e1c23b9a5812a3e924c161c1d0574"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qf0t5rs0u5d61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efde5ff7543b8737b63ec3812fe9367e35ca30a4"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qf0t5rs0u5d61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7518ede28359d4601d94eb828b429796ef6df681"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qf0t5rs0u5d61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7432ae32f23eb84925dc0dea06e4ef1397584a46"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qf0t5rs0u5d61.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c87d5274fa17fccdb50f80243c7403ea8383fa2a"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qf0t5rs0u5d61.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed0dac8c2d8160ded291c2d7471257188a648aa5"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qf0t5rs0u5d61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93f16fcb5c3c43b5aa033c3000469439858f4475"}, "id": "qf0t5rs0u5d61"}}, "name": "t3_l3me39", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Recapitulation", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/zh5vtwsyw0PKXY1UBhRC6kq_oWx9teL_9Jg0ImG47VE.jpg", "edited": 1611444862.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1611441757.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qf0t5rs0u5d61.jpg?width=2048&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=93f16fcb5c3c43b5aa033c3000469439858f4475\"&gt;Recapitulation is a \\&amp;quot;Complete Path\\&amp;quot;, as long as you heed the Assemblage Point position.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m calling this a &amp;quot;darkroom game&amp;quot; because it&amp;#39;s basically just ping pong recapitulation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it works like a charm!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the good news is, you can close your eyes if you like.

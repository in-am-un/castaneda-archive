Is that assumption valid?\n\nIntuitively, based on the little I do know about these two concepts gleaned from this subreddit and from the first 5 books (which I am still reading through now) I would assume that I am a stalker, just because of how alien I feel towards the world I have suddenly found myself roaming about. To others, my life path looks ugly, aimless, without conviction. For a while this was true, but today, its only because the life I am living inside of my is so rich and demanding of my attention, that its like I have to do a system shutdown and boot up my \"Social/\"yes dear, I am listening and concerned\" OS in order to interact with the world. That OS is quite energy intensive and drains me extremely fast, so I retreat to the confines of the self, where I can roam free, free to work out the constant problems I feel I need to work out in my head. If I can somehow learn to take the MASSIVE amount of energy I spend daily on rumination, looping, and analyzing my body and mind for discomfort then magnifying it with zero effort or capacity to change it on my part, I know with 100% certainty that if I can find a way to break that energy free (this is what I assume moving the assemblage point is perhaps), and reapply it to that which I intend, my power as a sorceror will be something that the whole world will tremble at. I do not want the whole world to tremble, but if that were my will, if I were to find success in moving the AP,  I say that only to express the fact that if I wanted that, they would. There is a power locked deep inside of me perhaps unlike anything the world has ever known. This is more likely me misinterpeting the energy. Its probably just what I (not the world) has ever known.   \n\n\nIt often seems like in order to fit in with the pack even for a moment, I  often have to observe others when they think they are not being observed, taking note of human social behaviors in their natural form, and take note so that I can replicate them at a later time when I need to fit the same social puzzle piece as that which the energy I observe in others would unlock.  I cannot NOT do this, at least not if I want to \"safely\" navigate the world of 3D social interaction. Its like I have to observe them to determine what the normies consider acceptable, normal behavior. Otherwise my totally unique nature manifests itself in ways that 9/10 people will despise for reasons I cannot know. Its like my energy refuses to connect to anyone I dont see as being totally void of cultural conditioning. If I can predict your political ideaology, your values, and your fears without you ever even speaking to me, I simply cannot engage with you in an authentic capacity. Its like my body won't let me. Because of this, I assume they see me as aloof, selfish, lost, shy, etc. I am none of these things yet I know that technically, I guess I am. There are a rare few however, those last 1/10th, who can meet me where I am with authenticity and legitimate, effortless engagement. They are almost always older, almost always gentle (feminine), and almost always know me despite my not sharing my past. Its weird. Its not like I know that they know me through their verbally communicating that but it stems from something deeper.

I can see that I have one foot in the nagual, and one here in 3D, which from what I have learned, is a dangerous place to remain for long. I believe this is why I am so easily destabilized, because I am standing on a boundary, rather than on the lands that boundary divides.\n\nIs this stalking?

All of us are connected to intent but we lose our way getting stuck in the BS of the world; the connection becomes sullied and unreliable. Being a sorcerer seer then implies mastery of intent, your command is the eagle's command. With complete mastery of intent, you can do anything from exploring the infinite realms out there in infinity to changing to a different timeline on Earth to exploring the 600 alternative copies of yourself and living their lives in their respective realities. The concept of intent is similar to the Force in Star Wars. Intent, The Force, is an impersonal superintelligent force that is completely neutral. It helps the dark side just as much as the light side; it obeys the command of those who have a strong and reliable connecting link. \n\t\nDarkroom is the most recommended practice here because it's the most expeditious in producing real magic in the shortest amount of time. Recap is great too but to really do it correctly, you must do it for 3+ hours a day, which pretty much nobody in here does. Most here do varying amounts of recap in order to lessen the pull of irritable memories and to recall the energy lost in those events. So it's a good idea to do recap on the things that are bothering you presently such as that annoying coworker or asshole who cut you off in line; things that occupy your normal awareness and prevent silence. Later on recap becomes absolutely necessary to become a true seer. \n\t\nTo start darkroom, you will need at least a minimum of silence practice, otherwise you'll just waste your 6 hours. It's recommended to first get familiar with the feel of silence and to practice reducing the sheer amount of thoughts that constantly echo through your head. While full silence is preferred in the long run, you can start your silence practice but first getting into the habit of eliminating all \"me\" thoughts. \"Me\" thoughts are like thoughts like \"why did so and so get a raise but I didn\u2019t?\" \"I need to clean my room, I'm so lazy!\" or \"I'm a super special human being with extra energy. Why won't others agree with me and recognize my prowess?\" You must seek to eliminate these thoughts from your mind the moment you become aware you are having them. Other, no \"me\" thoughts are okay. These can be mental imagery of the sky, birds, etc or the feel of the wind, the feel of all of your muscles as you do sports or other exercises. This leads me to the second thing you must practice, tensegrity. Take some time to learn doing a few tensegrity forms. They are not only magical in nature but also have the practical function of keeping you awake in the darkroom. They also give you more energy and cause the darkroom effects to become way more vivid. Focus your awareness of the feel of each of the movements, the feel of your muscles and the flow between the movements, the smoothness. Next, you must dedicate hours every single day to this practice or you will get weak results. You must be consistent in your struggles with silence in the darkroom every single day, even on bad days (you will have many many bad days). Intent will notice and give you real gifts! I received an intent gift, a red zone preview after practicing for maybe 2 weeks consistently but it took me months of practice later on to get anywhere close to that. For me, progress was slow because I was lazy and inconsistent in the beginning. \n\t\nSo in conclusion, do darkroom, a little recap, learn some tensegrity, force silence the best you can, and keep consistent.

Nobody here wants to police this place, it's just that the intent of the original Olmec sorcerers is so faint that trying to practice this along with 10 other religions/systems will only lead to weak results - instead of giving you quick results if you stick with the sub only, intent will assume you want to progress in 10 other things at the same time and you'll just get mediocre results from being spread too thin.

My father mentioned to me at the time, that Carlos had visited her as she was dying in bed.  He had a story to tell about what Carlos said, but I forgot it.\n\nI maybe even worked with Carlos earlier. Digging up Luiseno Indian Artifacts with the UC system.   But I was only 9, and wouldn't have noticed that much.\n\nMy father was  likely having an affair with the long time companion of Carlos, \"Joanie\".  A UC anthropologist groupie.  My father was an anthropologist for UCR.  \n\nAt least, Carlos seemed to believe that was true when he pulled a prank on me, and forced us to shake hands.\n\nMy father was instrumental in setting up the printing presses of Morongo Reservation where Carlos first went to find don Juan, and ran into a friend of mine Ruby. \n\nThe witch at Morongo back then. She pointed him elsewhere.  \n\nI ran into Carlos and the witches again in the 1970s.  Almost surely saw that famous picture of Taisha doing Karate being taken.  At least, I saw her being photographed that year, with that background.  And Carlos likely standing in the same room.\n\nPracticed Shotokan with Taisha under Nishiyama in Los Angeles.\n\nAnd a companion, either Florinda or Carol. It's been too long.\n\nWent to the Budokan on the same plane with Taisha, for that famous tournament where she got angry and rang the gong.\n\nBut we also have Jadey and Cholita helping.  Also direct students of Carlos.\n\nCholita was helpful to Carlos in importing art from Mexico.  Selling off the lineages assets most likely.

My father mentioned to me at the time, that Carlos had visited her as she was dying in bed.  He had a story to tell about what Carlos said, but I forgot it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I maybe even worked with Carlos earlier. Digging up Luiseno Indian Artifacts with the UC system.   But I was only 9, and wouldn&amp;#39;t have noticed that much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father was  likely having an affair with the long time companion of Carlos, &amp;quot;Joanie&amp;quot;.  A UC anthropologist groupie.  My father was an anthropologist for UCR.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, Carlos seemed to believe that was true when he pulled a prank on me, and forced us to shake hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My father was instrumental in setting up the printing presses of Morongo Reservation where Carlos first went to find don Juan, and ran into a friend of mine Ruby. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The witch at Morongo back then. She pointed him elsewhere.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran into Carlos and the witches again in the 1970s.  Almost surely saw that famous picture of Taisha doing Karate being taken.  At least, I saw her being photographed that year, with that background.  And Carlos likely standing in the same room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Practiced Shotokan with Taisha under Nishiyama in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a companion, either Florinda or Carol. It&amp;#39;s been too long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Went to the Budokan on the same plane with Taisha, for that famous tournament where she got angry and rang the gong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we also have Jadey and Cholita helping.  Also direct students of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita was helpful to Carlos in importing art from Mexico.  Selling off the lineages assets most likely. I suspect she knows some of the apprentices of don Juan, who came up here to be around Carlos.  Maybe even Soledad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the rest from private classes are lost now.   Gave up.

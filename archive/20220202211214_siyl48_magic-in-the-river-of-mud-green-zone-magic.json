They're weren't as long, weren't as \"epic\", and were not presented in teaching form, with instructions.\n\nThey were basically \"sales pitches\" for the Buddha, or some mysterious Daoist living in the mountains, drinking morning dew and eating sunshine.\n\nNone of those stories told you the \"how to\".\n\nSo what's the point anyway, without a \"how to\"?\n\nBeats me, but people love that sort of thing.\n\nThen they gave out some terribly worn out \"almost magic\" techniques, like meditation using mantras and contemplation, and people saw a \"tiny\" bit of magic.\n\nSometimes.  And only talented people.\n\nYou'd think after hundreds of years of nothing, or even after sitting on your butt practicing your \"magic\" techniques for decades, you'd wake up and say, \"Hey!!!  There NO MAGIC in this magic.\"\n\nBut people don't.  Because the so called \"magic\" is filling another need.\n\nGreed, attention seeking.\n\n\"Indulging in being a Guru\" as don Juan put it.\n\nDoes anyone really believe, after reading about don Juan, that someone with that kind of magical power would sit around on a little throne, listening to monks chant?\n\nIt makes NO SENSE.\n\nBut they do it.  And they'll even lynch  you, if you try to offer them the real thing.\n\nOddly, I've become an expert who's never existed in all of human history, on crap magic.\n\nAnd what motivates it.  And what prevents real magic.\n\nIt's the internet.  I go from \"magic\" to magic on the net, and try to wake some of the people up by pointing them to our pictures.\n\nIt ought to be that they go there, see the pics, their jaw drops, and then we can have a discussion.\n\nI fancy they'll say, \"Your making it up!\"\n\nSo I'll point out, although I draw the most pictures, there are some in there by others. It's just hard to draw like that, and why should they?  They don't care if someone else learns.\n\nThe only reason I do it, is because Carlos lamented to me that he'd failed, and no one believed him.\n\nHe said the same to another original student we have in here.\n\nI just want to \"undo\" the part where no one believed him.\n\nSo I do what he did.\n\nHe made pictures!   Every book, a cool illustration of real magic.  And he also produced other materials, outside the books.  Like the poster of \"The Wall\", which is now lost.\n\nAnd the covers of the videos.  What the heck is going on there, with those eggs floating around some weird planet of the sharp spiked branches?\n\nHe was portraying something you can easily learn to see for yourself, trying to get people interested in working harder.\n\nThat's what I do.\n\nSo on seeing those, you'd expect a conversation to take place.\n\nBut it never does!\n\nWhy?\n\nTwo reasons.\n\nPeople don't want magic. They want attention.  And they can only get the tastiest kind of \"juicy\" attention from the highest organization.  Like the Buddhist Church system.\n\nWhat better endorsement could you get, for having your own \"magic\".\n\nExcept, the truth is, they don't have any.\n\nNor do the Daoists, or anyone else you can name.\n\nWith a few exceptions I won't go into.  Because even though they potentially DO have magic, they never do in real practice.\n\nYou'll have to figure out what those other systems are, so I don't tempt anyone to waste their time.\n\nBesides, any magic out there is based on the type we have.\n\nThere are only a few categories of REAL magic.  None known that aren't contained in the type we practice.\n\nAnd the type we practice is pre agriculture, pre money, and before any reason anyone could have  had, to lie about it and make stuff up.\n\nIt was just primitive man, running around looking for food, and discovering the real world on their own.\n\nAnd spirits.\n\nIf they had made up stuff, their friends would have realized it and chastised them.\n\nThey'd get no attention by lying.\n\nBut after money was created, agriculture allowed people to live in small rooms in cities, THEN there was plenty of reason to lie and seduce others with pretend magic.\n\nThat's what we have now.\n\nBut why do the pretend magic people, like Dzogchen folks, get so upset when you try to help them out.\n\nIt's that green zone on the J curve.\n\nIf you put in any real effort, you will get there quickly.  If it takes a week, you just aren't trying to be silent hard enough.  Excellent would be if it only took 3 days.\n\nBut once you get there, you'll start to understand why the world has become deluded.\n\nGreen zone magic is easy to get.  It can be \"extended\" with horizontal shifts of the assemblage point, and it seems like it would lead to coolness, if you kept at it.\n\nExcept, that's the big misunderstanding people have.  Truth is, YOU CANNOT LEARN MAGIC.\n\nAll you can do is move the assemblage point, and magic becomes visible.\n\nBut JUST the magic available, at that position on the assemblage point.\n\nTo explain this so as to convince a new person, would take too long.  But I'll use an analogy, and also the explanation given to me by the Devil's Weed Entity.\n\nYou remember that weirdo from the books!  The entity behind the talking lizards.\n\nHe used to follow Cholita the witch around my home, scurrying along like a weird lizard with 1 inch long toe nails.  Carlos lent him to us, just before he died.\n\nThe Allies have been the majority of the teaching for sorcerers, for many thousands of  years.\n\nAfter decades of Devil's Weed and Little smoke scaring the hell out of me once in a while, I finally realized what was going on and was no longer afraid of them.\n\nBut still I'd walk into my living room, and there was a really weird lizard making scratching noises on my oak floors.\n\nI'd go to the back yard to complain to Cholita, who would be bent over in a very provocative position, digging in her garden.\n\nI'd point to the lizard to tell her, and in it's place I'd see a squirrel.\n\n\"Cholita, a squirrel got in!  Could you please keep the back door shut?!\", I'd ask her.\n\nI walked back to see if I should grab the squirrel, only to find, it was begging for food.\n\nThat's how weird sorcery eventually gets.  If it surprises anyone, it's only because so much time has gone by, with no one actually trying to learn sorcery.  To learn sorcery, you have to force that internal dialogue off.  And that  hurts!\n\nSo no one did. They decided to do what all Buddhists, Daoists, and Hindus so.\n\nGo for the attention.  Pretend to be a guru.  \"Earn your way up in the system\".\n\nWhy work hard to learn magic, if you can just get an organization to declare you to have it, and then people will admire and obey you?\n\nWe get bad men who come in here, make up advanced experiences, and try to use bullying and anger to force us to leave them alone, so they can \"join in on the attention\".\n\nThis place is like honey to flies, for bad men.\n\nTruth is, no one really wants magic.  They want something else. \n\nAnd to make the most money, an organization has to figure out what they want and give it to them.\n\nSlowly.  With workshop fees, donations, gifts to the Church, and so on.\n\nIt's not profitable to tell them, \"Shut off that little voice in your head, and then come back to talk to me.\"\n\nThey never will.\n\nSo the \"systems\" cheat people by claiming to have magic, telling stories about the Saints of their phony line of magic men. And then just to make sure it tricks everyone, they give out some worn out old technique they don't really even understand.\n\nMeditation.\n\nMeditation will virtually never get you past the green zone on that J curve.  In some very rare cases, a person might change his meditation into internal silence all by himself, and get a little red zone magic to happen.    And certainly with drugs you can get down to the red zone.\n\nDaoists still grow opium poppies to this day, which they mix with wine in order to experience, \"The Dao\".\n\nBut without the support of the advice from thousands of  years of unbroken REAL magical learning, which the Olmec possessed, it's hopeless for them to get anywhere useful.\n\nHere's the analogy, and then the advice from Devil's Weed entity.    \n\nWho Cholita brought over for a visit yesterday.\n\nCholita's found a new home somewhere.  Someone has decided to take care of her.\n\nThe analogy:\n\nThere's a religion based on  a giant breakfast muffin, with nuts.  It's the all seeing muffin of goodness.\n\nOf course no one will ever see the muffin for real. But after obsessing over it, they'll surely dream about it once in a while.   And then to flatter themselves, they'll run to their friends  shouting, \"I'VE SEEN THE MUFFIN!!!\"\n\nAdded to that, the \"Muffin monks\" sprinkle some crushed nuts around the temple grounds,  and if a student gets doubtful they walk him around the temple grounds, and \"accidentally stumble\" on some sacretd nut fragments.  \n\n\"See?!!!\" they say.  The Muffin loves us.\n\nOddly, it works.\n\nBut I suppose Minx, the inorganic being's version,  is easier to follow.\n\nIf not a little weirder.\n\nI renamed Devil's Weed entity Minx, mostly because I don't like him.  He always sides with Cholita, and even told me so once.\n\nI got this explanation because Cholita came to visit yesterday, filled the house with dark energy, and I saw a chance to go back and forth between the tonal, and the double.\n\nYou can do it too, but that's for another time.\n\nI was in a shared dream, and Minx was walking around pretending to be human.\n\nI kept trying to see his face, to find out if he was doing the Irish boy imitation Cholita likes.\n\nI commented that he hadn't gotten the face right and he turned to look at me. His face was then covered in a black ski mask, so that no features at all were present.\n\nKeep in mind, this was awake.  Not asleep.  And fully sober. We don't use drugs in here.  Unless someone is having fun on a long weekend.\n\nBut my assemblage point was far into the orange zone on that J curve.\n\nMinx ripped his face off, including the black hood, and dropped it into my hands.\n\nI could see everything you'd expect to find under his \"face\".   \n\n\nIt was quite gruesome.\n\nBut that's what inorganic beings do.\n\nHe started to give me a lecture on the green zone.\n\nI would have been distrustful of the entire thing, except the lecture was so good I had to pay attention. It made perfect sense.\n\nOne day you'll get one too, and realize you have to \"flatten\" the story to tell it.  But all the details are true. It's just that the real thing comes with \"visual aids\" floating in the air.  So it's more like one of those TV show memories, where the hero is telling other people about something that happened to him, and the show flashes back to his memories as little scenes.  It's a re-run in a TV Show.\n\nI'll continue in the next comment...", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Magic in the River of Mud (Green Zone magic)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"s1o6mrvs2hf81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s1o6mrvs2hf81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=515fc572b0f46753ba3a9cfe853918f08b3b57bc"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s1o6mrvs2hf81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f4c04e9c82a9c70793f1b6312ed935e98f118e1"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s1o6mrvs2hf81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bec0b9a1729be5c4e83161c8a3f10f69fcff326e"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s1o6mrvs2hf81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e93bac5464ecb3803604814e493449016683412"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s1o6mrvs2hf81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0fc7a57a07ef4770d7ddae65e7d6e62ceb518fc"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s1o6mrvs2hf81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08cb1f4b4b0c6145f07e67fc0905cd34a26a9730"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/s1o6mrvs2hf81.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d17852fa41de61871ba440363d342cde38a60110"}, "id": "s1o6mrvs2hf81"}}, "name": "t3_siyl48", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/srKhFDZ8j467_HxvmJq2DOOPA77oy4MxDt4CByjdYm4.jpg", "edited": 1643836757.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1643832734.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/s1o6mrvs2hf81.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d17852fa41de61871ba440363d342cde38a60110\"&gt;Inorganic Being Explanation Of Green Zone Magic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose we have beginners in here, and it&amp;#39;s not a good idea to talk too much about what happens past the pink zone on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just TOO MUCH.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t recall that far back, absolutely no one in the world of magic and shamanism believed the books of Carlos when they first came out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, the books made them look bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No one can do that!&amp;quot;  At least, that was their belief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A strange belief however, because all of the magical &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot; are based around stories like those in the books.

With workshop fees, donations, gifts to the Church, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not profitable to tell them, &amp;quot;Shut off that little voice in your head, and then come back to talk to me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They never will.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot; cheat people by claiming to have magic, telling stories about the Saints of their phony line of magic men. And then just to make sure it tricks everyone, they give out some worn out old technique they don&amp;#39;t really even understand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meditation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meditation will virtually never get you past the green zone on that J curve.  In some very rare cases, a person might change his meditation into internal silence all by himself, and get a little red zone magic to happen.    And certainly with drugs you can get down to the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daoists still grow opium poppies to this day, which they mix with wine in order to experience, &amp;quot;The Dao&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But without the support of the advice from thousands of  years of unbroken REAL magical learning, which the Olmec possessed, it&amp;#39;s hopeless for them to get anywhere useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the analogy, and then the advice from Devil&amp;#39;s Weed entity.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who Cholita brought over for a visit yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s found a new home somewhere.  Someone has decided to take care of her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The analogy:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a religion based on  a giant breakfast muffin, with nuts.  It&amp;#39;s the all seeing muffin of goodness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course no one will ever see the muffin for real. But after obsessing over it, they&amp;#39;ll surely dream about it once in a while.   And then to flatter themselves, they&amp;#39;ll run to their friends  shouting, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;VE SEEN THE MUFFIN!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Added to that, the &amp;quot;Muffin monks&amp;quot; sprinkle some crushed nuts around the temple grounds,  and if a student gets doubtful they walk him around the temple grounds, and &amp;quot;accidentally stumble&amp;quot; on some sacretd nut fragments.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;See?!!!&amp;quot; they say.  The Muffin loves us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oddly, it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I suppose Minx, the inorganic being&amp;#39;s version,  is easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not a little weirder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I renamed Devil&amp;#39;s Weed entity Minx, mostly because I don&amp;#39;t like him.  He always sides with Cholita, and even told me so once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got this explanation because Cholita came to visit yesterday, filled the house with dark energy, and I saw a chance to go back and forth between the tonal, and the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can do it too, but that&amp;#39;s for another time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in a shared dream, and Minx was walking around pretending to be human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept trying to see his face, to find out if he was doing the Irish boy imitation Cholita likes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I commented that he hadn&amp;#39;t gotten the face right and he turned to look at me. His face was then covered in a black ski mask, so that no features at all were present.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, this was awake.  Not asleep.  And fully sober. We don&amp;#39;t use drugs in here.  Unless someone is having fun on a long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my assemblage point was far into the orange zone on that J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx ripped his face off, including the black hood, and dropped it into my hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could see everything you&amp;#39;d expect to find under his &amp;quot;face&amp;quot;.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was quite gruesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s what inorganic beings do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He started to give me a lecture on the green zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would have been distrustful of the entire thing, except the lecture was so good I had to pay attention. It made perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day you&amp;#39;ll get one too, and realize you have to &amp;quot;flatten&amp;quot; the story to tell it.  But all the details are true. It&amp;#39;s just that the real thing comes with &amp;quot;visual aids&amp;quot; floating in the air.  So it&amp;#39;s more like one of those TV show memories, where the hero is telling other people about something that happened to him, and the show flashes back to his memories as little scenes.  It&amp;#39;s a re-run in a TV Show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll continue in the next comment...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "14394d18-6006-11ea-b6bf-0e2e5ff77301", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "siyl48", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 71, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/siyl48/magic_in_the_river_of_mud_green_zone_magic/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/siyl48/magic_in_the_river_of_mud_green_zone_magic/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1643832734.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hvgds0k", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hvga3ru", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I suppose Soledad must be dead by now, and it's Hollywood just using the books for material?\n\nBut then is Beningo also dead?\n\nCould would only be 94 now.

Including their \"wise teachings\".\n\nBut the Olmec discovered, that's only a fraction of reality.\n\nSo they went exploring outside the island of the tonal.\n\nThey saw it as a vast dark sea of awareness, most of it completely unexplored.\n\nThey soon discovered, the vehicle to explore it is to remove your awareness from all things on the island of the tonal.  \"The Spirit\" doesn't like that, so he refocuses you on the next most available thing.  \n\nYou're a probe.  Stop probing, and he'll move you to another location to get you started again.\n\nBut the internal dialogue keeps reminding you of those items on the Island of the Tonal.  \n\nSo you never manage to move away from the world that lacks magic, so you can grow and progress along the \"path with heart\".\n\nThe path where you grow in magical powers.\n\nEach internal dialogue \"reminder\"  using words, focuses your awareness back there.  On the blue line of the J curve.\n\nAnd the \"range\" our awareness can focus along the J curve, is only a circle a few inches in diameter.\n\nSo if you think, \"Hamburger\", you can't travel further away from the island of the tonal than 6 inches.  Meaning, your glow of awareness cannot shine on what's past that.\n\nI hope you can all intuit, that false narratives in  your mind, lies told by the \"systems\" out there, are all designed to hold you at the blue line.\n\nI won't list them, because that's like taking a child's toy doll away from them.\n\nSuffice it to say, you've been brainwashed by the Buddha.\n\nOr Lao Tsu.\n\nOr by crazy Hindu \"sages\".\n\nBut that  6 inch stretch is enough to get you to the green line on the J curve. \n\nFrom the blue.\n\nThere you have \"meditation magic\".  Visions, sensations of bliss, feelings of falling, and, fortunately, spirits.\n\nSpirits just barely become visible on the green line.\n\nYou could of course breeze past that green line towards the red, if you could just remove that talking voice in your head.\n\nBut it  hurts.\n\nAnd when people see green zone magic, they believe they've hit the jackpot!\n\nThey've finally got some magic going.\n\nDoesn't bother them that they have to keep their eyes closed. And they don't notice, they can never go further, because there are 2 \"exits\" from the green zone.\n\nBack up to the blue line, or off into sleep. With your eyes closed, doing your lame meditation technique, you're sure to fall asleep.\n\nIn Sleep they dream of even more magic, and so the \"self-flattery\" is very alluring.\n\nAnd with a few good \"Tales of the Green Zone\", combined with delusional dreams misrepresented as more magic, they have all they need to get what they really wanted.\n\nAttention, fame and cash from other people.\n\nOnce they have a tiny bit of green zone magic, and if they have obeyed and given all donations to their church, they gain a little status in their \"system\".\n\nThe head Dali Lama for their little group, often  just a bad Russian man, notices them, flatters them, and decides they'd do well, in his little \"organization\".\n\nThey can smell the promotions coming!\n\nAnd so the green zone functions as it's supposed to.\n\nA filter to remove dangerous magic, and preserve only that which is \"safe\" for blue zone inhabitants.\n\nMagic that's merely \"amusing\", but which keeps you on the Island of the Tonal.\n\nBut how do their techniques to produce green magic work?\n\nAll the same.  They don't \"remove\" the internal dialogue, as you need to do to move all the way along the J curve.  Or to put it more simply, they don't allow you to remove your attention from whatever you are perceiving.\n\nYou have to be silent to do that.\n\nBut they do let you stretch it a bit, to get a look \"down below\".\n\nThe techniques include anything which \"disturbs\", or \"disrupts\" the internal dialogue, removing it from it's habitual routine of going around in circles in  your mind.\n\nI favor the TM mantra, \"Aing...\".  Just repeat it over and over, and you'll slide down to the green zone.  Just avoid fantasizing, which is a long term interruption of the manta.\n\nRepeat only that, and you'll see all the available green zone magic.\n\nBut you can also \"distract\" the internal dialogue.  By contemplation of a topic, so you think only about bible verses, or visualizing a golden Buddha on your head.\n\nOr you can ponder a \"puzzle\". A \"Koan\".  That has the added benefit of appealing to angry men, who want to \"prove themselves\" by figuring out the unfathomable puzzle, to prove their superiority.\n\nYou can try to \"grasp the Dao\".  Another angry male lure.\n\nYou can chant, listen to a drum beat, or dance in odd ways that block out external stimuli and allow you to interrupt the steady flow of the internal dialogues musings about the world.\n\nSufi Dance can do it.\n\nThe Mennonites (see Beetlejuice) do it by \"ecstatic prayer\", thrashing about on the floor shouting, \"I have DEMONS running all through me\".\n\nAnd you can also manipulate other people into the green zone!  If you're a sorcerer that is.\n\nIntense fear cause our internal dialogue to temporarily stop, while we try to figure out if we have to run for our lives.\n\nEmbarrassment interrupts it.  Don Juan was fond of telling Carlos his zipper was down and he had an obvious erection.\n\nYou can dream up your own ways, it's really not hard.\n\nSome we call, \"not-doings\", or \"gazing\".\n\nYou just have to interrupt, distract, or replace the internal dialogue, and you can slide down to the green zone.\n\nBut to get to the red, you have to make the internal dialogue \"intermittent\".\n\nIt has to shut off a while, continuously.   I'd say 2 minutes, which you can repeat over and over between \"mistakes\", would do the job.\n\nYou can mess up, but it needs to be gone enough that you lose sight of blue zone things.  That's the key to it all. Withdraw your awareness and it moves to a new location.\n\nTo move it down the bottom and up the front of the body, you have to stop it for **sustained** periods.\n\nTo get to the pink zone it has to be mostly gone, most of the time.\n\nFor the deep orange zone, where magic is so amazing you no longer need anyone to tell you about it, you need complete silence.\n\nFor long periods of time like 30 minutes straight.\n\nIn handing me his face in such a gruesome fashion, Minx had actually given me a ball of dark energy, which he then used to give me his lecture.\n\nBut dark energy is like oil, which can allow the assemblage point to slide when it ought to encounter resistance.\n\nIt can be moved by the situation, and not just through internal silence.\n\nHis lecture on the green zone continued even further, but the rest was lost as soon as I returned from the shared dream, to practicing darkroom.\n\nMost gone, in seconds.", "edited": 1643838589.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hvbqp6c", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;continued from the main post...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The green zone is a buffer between &amp;quot;Accepted reality&amp;quot; (the blue zone), and the frightening, insane magic of the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its&amp;#39; an &amp;quot;excuse&amp;quot; for when weird things seep into our awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without it, we&amp;#39;d check ourselves into a mental hospital whenever our assemblage point slipped down too far due to traumatic circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any red zone magic that might be available, is &amp;quot;tested&amp;quot; in the green zone first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t possibly leave the green zone, without at least some internal silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to at least reduce the internal dialogue, to get to the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because every single word you think, is coming from the blue zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;Island of the Tonal&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything you know about, everything you can read about, talk about, or even think about, is part of that Island of the Tonal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Including by the way,  God, Heaven, Angels, Demons, the Buddha, Lao Tsu, and Yogananda.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All just more items on the Island of the Tonal.

You don't normally notice those, because your gaze causes the puff to orient your way, with any \"hijacked awareness\" stuck to the back side.\n\nAs I was squishing the puff, to make sure there were intense yellow sparkles in the middle,   I noticed a manifestation up in the air.\n\nI cast the ball through the tunnel,  and gazed deeply to try to see scenery on the other end.\n\nBut all I saw was Fancy, looking back at me from a huge distance.\n\nI turned my gaze to the weird stuff forming in the air, and made a mental note.\n\nIt's a dream bubble.\n\nBut it's also a magical object.\n\nIt's a \"malformed magical object with dream passages in it\".\n\nSort of like my tunnel.\n\nIt hadn't occurred to me that dream bubbles and magical objects, two things I put in my map to Silent Knowledge, are sort of \"squishy\".\n\nOne can be the other.\n\nI wasn't happy with that. I like orderly steps.\n\nA voice began to tell a story about the niece of the Wuwonians.\n\nI looked around for \"the storyteller\", but I had fallen into the story as if it were a dream.\n\nI was watching it. And it seemed to be trying to explain what I had been wondering about.\n\nAs the story went, the Wuwonians are great religious leaders on their world, but their religion is a fraud.\n\nThey're given to ritualized intending. Magic summoned by repeated actions, designed to lead to an expected result.\n\nThey don't like to have to practice only in secret. They want to practice all the time.\n\nSo using humor and their pretend religion which teaches people to be \"superior\", they pulled the rug over everyone's eyes.\n\nMaking the entire world blind to their weird ritual behavior.\n\nExcept their niece.\n\nShe used to hang out, trying to memorize their weird movements.\n\nBut being a child she wasn't very worried about being \"accurate\".\n\nShe wanted to know what was going on in general.\n\nAnd was willing to fake the movements, as long as they fit with what she understood to be the process.\n\nShe came to an odd understanding.  She believed that the magic was from spirits, and the Wuwonians were \"enchanted\" by powerful beings.\n\nWho had granted them the wish that all of their movements would produce the magic they sought.\n\nThe key seemed to be seeing stuff in darkness.\n\nShe watched them many times as they seemed to be perfecting their \"darkness skills\".\n\nThe Wuwonians are \"all the time\" practitioners, but she had focused on the darkness activities, because they were secretive and she was unsure of her own abilities.\n\nWhen she wasn't with her Uncles observing, she was at home in the dark, staring for colors.\n\nShe had no problem finding some, but she always fell asleep.\n\nIt took her weeks to learn not to fall asleep, and to only view the colors in the darkness.  And with her eyes open.\n\nWhen she finally had that ability, she tried to remember some of their movements.\n\nBut she had never paid attention to the exact details.\n\nSo she assumed, now that she had the colors, the spirits had bewitched her too.\n\nShe raised her hand, and snapped her fingers.\n\nA few feet away to the right, a sparkle formed.\n\nIt looked a little like a fireworks sparkle, breaking off from a lager display.\n\nIt lasted only an instant, and she wasn't even sure she saw it.\n\nBut she continued under the belief that the spirits would finally figure out what she intended, and make it more real.\n\nOver time she gained more and more ability to use her snapping fingers to accomplish specific tasks.\n\nA simple snap produced a sparkle.\n\nA snap done when the hand was moving slowly, produced a flash.\n\nShe could see the geometric shape of the flash!   Usually they seemed to have 4 sides.\n\nShe tried to find the \"orientation\" by snapping and moving her hand in various ways, until she began to believe she could ultimately figure out this mystery.\n\nShe got the idea to form a much larger sparkle,  and then open it's rectangular shape like a door to another world.\n\nHer uncles had told stories about that.\n\nShe tried snapping her fingers repeatedly in the air, to try to make a bigger \"flash\".\n\nA weird spirit materialized.\n\nShe had been playing with visible magic so long that she accidentally summoned \"Silent Knowledge\".\n\nHer assemblage point had moved all along the J curve, into alignment with that of her double.\n\nBut none of that was obvious, because she hadn't learned to build an energy body.\n\nShe had unwittingly followed the path most witches take.  Just try and see what works!\n\nExcept she started from the knowledge of her Uncles, so the results were more dramatic than usual.\n\nHer weird little spirit friend was born of Silent Knowledge.\n\nIt became a conduit for teaching her.\n\nHanging out with her spirit, she received so much instruction that it was perfectly normal for her to reside for hours in full on Silent Knowledge.\n\nExcept she only thought she had gained her own spirit assistant.\n\nShe had no knowledge of the dreaming double, or of inorganic beings.\n\nHer \"spirit\" had no real awareness behind it, other than her own.\n\nBut with access to all of the knowledge of mankind, it seemed to be absolutely real.\n\nShe ultimately learned how to make it fully visible, even to other people.\n\nOr how to just let it remain as a voice in the background, telling her things that interested her.\n\nWhen she wanted it to be \"more real\" she could glance down, close her eyes, and send telepathic messages to it, to urge it to \"take form\".\n\nBut in reality, she was visualizing her double helping out.\n\nHer energy body would take over the Silent Knowledge Entity when she \"willed it to\".\n\nShe also had some contact with inorganic beings, but because she had taken the path of a witch she didn't understand.\n\nShe believed those were just another form of \"snap sparkle\", which came into being because of her actions.  She had in fact already used \"snap magic\" to materialize smally toys and real looking things.  Not on demand, but she knew that can happen too.\n\nSo she mistook inorganic beings for those.  The IOBs could never form a good connection to her, and so she got largely left alone by them.  Except in her dreams.\n\nShe had created an \"incomplete doing\".\n\nThe act of looking for colors in darkness was a \"not-doing\", until she saw some.\n\nThen it became a \"second attention doing\", which could move her assemblage point.\n\nBut along the way two anomalies appeared. And her \"doing\" did not include those in it's explanations.  She had a faulty belief system.\n\nShe confused 3 things, with one thing.\n\nSKEs, the double, and inorganic beings.\n\nIt's a common mistake for witches.\n\nAnd they usually don't care.\n\n\"Not making mistakes\" is a male obsession.  From a female point of view, it only slows them down.\n\nThis is one of the reasons that organized magical systems, like Buddhism, waste their best resource.\n\nWomen.\n\nThey design a profit making system which needs males to motivate the donations, and treats women as if they were not rational enough to describe the system the way it must be described to be \"correct\".\n\nSo while her \"doing\" was faulty, having been created mostly from her playful nature, the aspects of it she understood worked very well.\n\nShe was a witch.  A plague on male sorcerers, because she made it obvious they were dull despite their belief in their superior \"understanding\".\n\nOne day she used her \"snap magic\" in the presence of her SKE, to form a door to the Wuwonians.\n\nShe simply wanted to show them her SKE, so she snapped a door into existence.\n\nTo her uncle's house.\n\nBoth her and her SKE stepped through the door, to find startled Wuwonians on the other end.\n\nIn the middle of something else.\n\nThey were horrified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Silent Knowledge Entities in Witchcraft (Familiar Spirits)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silent Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"k2g3oyw0a2091": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k2g3oyw0a2091.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=189388525aa9ef1ff997d50cfa3f3c5e990a5ca8"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k2g3oyw0a2091.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58f7a21eaf24282723b55058526e4c9d8176af96"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k2g3oyw0a2091.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=402a4b7a42ce8654ca30485e1525bfda29e24021"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k2g3oyw0a2091.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86b08974890ddf321e0c7211549d6298d2263a9c"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k2g3oyw0a2091.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee1110fa7c3445b139d7b4ca341b9d76e4ac5503"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k2g3oyw0a2091.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62fb08bce2e34069619d56e21d65e3a00d16c8c3"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 2048, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/k2g3oyw0a2091.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c7d031ca7625d76cb1f6162038fcb957ba09dc4"}, "id": "k2g3oyw0a2091"}}, "name": "t3_urq2dm", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silent Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/rdBe4uWcPwjLGjzFHgSq5_4YJEQA-kC_Rn-R_DWGVVU.jpg", "edited": 1652817994.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1652804315.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/k2g3oyw0a2091.png?width=2048&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8c7d031ca7625d76cb1f6162038fcb957ba09dc4\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/k2g3oyw0a2091.png?width=2048&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8c7d031ca7625d76cb1f6162038fcb957ba09dc4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one is from the advanced subreddit, where it explains how to accidentally pee your pants in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best not to bring that over here, although it&amp;#39;s unknown if anyone will actually do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I&amp;#39;ll just tell the story of the little Wuwonian witch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came to view the story when I pressed some odd colors I found in the darkness into a ball to send through my 6000 mile tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had somehow lost 6 hours of time leading up to that, and didn&amp;#39;t realize it was nearly morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My IOB Fancy was around, and seemed to be implying I was goofing off and we ought to have gotten started much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I had no idea what time it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to turbo charge her by scooping up yellow puffs, which can be found under the purple ones, if you are willing to accept &amp;quot;dirty puffs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to brush the &amp;quot;purple dust&amp;quot;

A plague on male sorcerers, because she made it obvious they were dull despite their belief in their superior &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day she used her &amp;quot;snap magic&amp;quot; in the presence of her SKE, to form a door to the Wuwonians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She simply wanted to show them her SKE, so she snapped a door into existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To her uncle&amp;#39;s house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both her and her SKE stepped through the door, to find startled Wuwonians on the other end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the middle of something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were horrified.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "7e6deba4-a617-11ec-90b9-2a099f759379", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "urq2dm", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 4, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/urq2dm/silent_knowledge_entities_in_witchcraft_familiar/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/urq2dm/silent_knowledge_entities_in_witchcraft_familiar/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1652804315.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ia2kogv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i9zzwy3", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Nope.\n\nThis is a special situation.

You\u2019re never supposed to say it out loud.\n\nMe writing it here is a big TM sin.  However, it\u2019s on Wikipedia anyway.  You can\u2019t keep secrets like that anymore.\n\nWhile sitting in a chair with eyes closed, you repeat the mantra over and over in your mind, at a normal speed.  \n\nFor 20 minutes. Then stop the mantra and just relax 2 minutes, before you stand up.\n\nThe mantra rate can be what you like, but don\u2019t do it frantically.\n\nMaybe 1.5 seconds apart. \n\nLike this:  Aing\u2026.   Aing\u2026.  Aing\u2026\n\n You don't force any thoughts out, but if you notice them you try to gently return to the mantra.\n\nLater, maybe after you can feel \"bliss\", you can add Patanjali's sutras.\n\nThe way you do that is to meditate yourself into a state of bliss, then be silent (finally make the effort to shut off that internal dialogue). \n\nThen you repeat one of Patanjali's formulas such as:\n\n\"Pole Star\"\n\nAnd return to silence.\n\nIf you get it to work (I did), you find yourself watching a vision of stars flying by, as you travel out into the universe.\n\nThere\u2019s also my favorite:\n\n\u201cInner Lights\u201d.\n\nThat produces a vision of the colors you can see in darkness.\n\nOf course, all you're doing is interrupting the internal dialogue, with a pleasant sound in your mind to replace it.\n\nThey sell \u201cadvanced\u201d techniques. Chopra even sells them.\n\nThey are:  \n1 Aing\n\n2 Aing nama\n\n3 Shri Aing nama\n\n4, 5, 6 = $$$$$$$  \n\nTranslated they mean:  \n\n\nGod,  \nGod I am,  \nGreat God I am.\nMy charge card is maxed out.\n\n\nStick with the simple one. I find the rest embarrassing.\n\nAnd the sutra (Patanjali\u2019s formula) is merely a way to summon the intent of something, which works if you are silent.\n\nTM is much easier than forcing silence.\n\nThe way it really works is, your internal dialogue reduces enough to let your assemblage point drift, and you get all kinds of odd effects as it moves and releases energy.\n\nSome possible effects include visions, colors, muscles twitching, a feeling your mind is moving down to your stomach, a giant flash of light that seems like an explosion, and of course, you can fall asleep but remain lucid.\n\nYou can even find yourself looking at the room, with your eyes closed!\n\nIf you read my \"Simple Silence Technique\" you can figure out what to do with those effects.  How to exploit them to learn sorcery.\n\nUnfortunately, the TM people are brainwashed, similar to how the Zen people are brainwashed.\n\nSo they almost never reach \"enlightenment\", whatever that is.  \n\nAnd if they do, they\u2019re shunned. You\u2019re only allowed to make that claim if you fit into the money making organization correctly.\n\nWorse, you get to make that claim if you fit in and do your time, even if you aren\u2019t actually enlightened.\n\nThey always need someone to run the next temple, to increase profits.\n\nBoth techniques (Zen and TM) have been \"de-clawed\", to keep peace among the practitioners, so one person can handle more devotees and earn more cash.\n\nImagine if you had 100 students and you encouraged them to pursue sorcery using their technique.  \n\nYou\u2019d go out of your mind trying to handle all of them.\n\nEven I have students who freak out and quit, despite me saying soothing things.\n\nIt\u2019s that scary when sorcery starts to work.\n\nMyself, if I open the closet and find a corpse staring back at me, I\u2019m a happy camper.\n\nA black figure chasing me at night?\n\nI just stop and ask him not to hide. Can\u2019t we be friends?\n\nBut a lot of people will freak out over such things.\n\nSo TM and Zen are \u201cde-clawed\u201d, by telling people to ignore things.  If you ignore them, they don\u2019t develop to their potential.\n\nThat way, one teacher can manage 500 students\n\nZen practitioners will even get angry if you remind them of the cooler stuff they\u2019re missing out on.  They\u2019re too snobby for such childish things.\n\nThe TM people know about the cooler stuff, but if you describe it they won\u2019t believe you.\n\nTheir knowledge level is so low that Maharishi, the one who introduced the technique in the 60s,  once had a vision of a giant caterpillar surrounding the world, and strangling it.\n\nHe said war was imminent, and ordered his followers to gather in larger groups, to meditate and prevent the disaster.\n\nOf course, to gather in the larger groups they had to pay for a workshop.\n\nHis followers thought that vision was amazing, and he was so highly evolved!   They have some sort of hierarchy of consciousness, and they decided he must be at the 3rd of 4th level of enlightenment because of that vision.\n\nI can\u2019t recall which level it was.  But I was pleased they just didn\u2019t declare him a 10th degree black belt, the way martial arts schools are like to do when they don\u2019t have an organization behind them.\n\nActually, visions like Maharishi\u2019s are a dime a dozen in the sorcery world. It\u2019s not even a particularly interesting one. \n\nIf I saw a giant caterpillar surrounding the earth last night, I\u2019d have used it as an excuse to get out a Starbucks Espresso Double Shot can, guzzle it, and walk to where I could do a little more tensegrity to get better visions.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t declare war.\n\nBut Zen is the most insidious at confusing followers.  I\u2019m most familiar with how it kidnaps people, because of all the martial arts I\u2019ve studied. And they kidnapped my brother.\n\nThey have a sort of Zen aesthetics, with white furniture, white sand with lines in it, crudely drawn ink paintings, bad archery (high school students are better than Zen masters), and plants that have been tortured to form pleasing shapes.\n\nThe Zen archery is supposed to be cool because it manages to invoke the cerebellum, without thought. So the arrow seems to shoot by itself.\n\nBut frankly, someone extremely good at baseball has a lot more cool automatic body movements going on during a game.\n\nSo does anyone good at free-sparing.\n\nMy favorite Zen activity is tea ceremony. Zen for women!\n\nAnd for 14 year old girls.\n\nWealthy Japanese businessmen just can\u2019t get enough of those ultra-profound, Zen aesthetic tea ceremonies.\n\nAvailable for a reasonable fee, at the larger Buddhist temples in Japan. \n\nThey even have raunchy jokes about the temple girls, just so that you understand what they\u2019re really there for.\n\nZen substitutes symbols for the real thing, while claiming to do the opposite.\n\nAnd the symbols blind them to what\u2019s really happening.\n\nThe problem for me is, some Zen masters really are enlightened.\n\nAnd they say really cool stuff!\n\nBut it\u2019s stuff that\u2019s obvious to someone who can shut off their internal dialogue.\n\nThey merely aren\u2019t insane anymore, and by comparison to everyone else they seem wise.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell you their technique, because it varies by master.  \n\nBut essentially, they learn to be silent, through unnecessary hazing and unnecessarily vague instructions. \n\nTorture is sometimes included. Endless menial labor, sleep deprivation, calorie reduction.\n\nIf they\u2019re lucky, they have a nervous breakdown, but fall into silence due to all the meditation.\n\nThey stop learning after that.  They\u2019re arrived!\n\nFor years I\u2019ve had the theory that Carlos was counting on the nervous breakdown effect. \n\nThat some of his followers would have nervous breakdowns. \n\nNervous breakdown = strong and semi-permanent movement of the assemblage point to a new \u201cemergency\u201d position.\n\nThat produces an alternate personality.\n\nBut my thought was, instead of the \u201cemergency position\u201d of the assemblage point, they\u2019d fall into a \u201csweet spot\u201d that Carlos created in private class.\n\nThey\u2019d reach heightened awareness, as a result of what would otherwise be a very bad thing.\n\nSo far it hasn\u2019t happened to my knowledge.\n\nI supposed the Dzogchen Buddhists are as close to us as anything. They don\u2019t stop learning.\n\nThe problem there is, they\u2019ve been taught the mythology of rebirth as if it were an absolute fact.\n\nSo they\u2019re required to ignore some experiences, and emphasize others.\n\nThey aren't blinded, but they have one arm tied behind their backs.", "edited": 1581895205.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fhv2y6d", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh boy!

All you see is formed by intent.\n\nThink of it as, \"The Force\" from Star Wars.\n\nThey took that from Castaneda's books.  Listen to the \"Last Jedi\", where Luke explains the force.\n\nThat's pretty close to a good explanation of *intent*.\n\nIt takes the random energy that humans can perceive, and bundles it into useful groups.\n\nLike our world.\n\nBut it responds to your commands. That's what sorcery is, learning how to use it.  \n\nCommand is a bad word there, but once you learn the rules, you can in fact command it.\n\nThe rules are, whatever you want it to do has to be for some abstract purpose. And even better if it\u2019s funny. Or extremely daring.\n\nMy best guess is that intent likes it when something we request uplifts us.  \n\nLike a parent giving in to the candy a child wants them to buy, because the child plans to surprise his best friend with it.\n\nIntent works on many levels.  Because it\u2019s everything, then anything in particular will seem like a way to manipulate it.\n\nAnd you might wonder, if you can manipulate it one way, why can you also manipulate it another, and get a different result?\n\nThat\u2019s sort of like the love affair we all have with intent. It\u2019s been watching us since we were born, trying to help us out, with it\u2019s own goals in mind too.\n\nIf you get silent in darkness, you can summon things using intent. \n\nAnything you like!  It will materialize in front of you.\n\nYou can also use intent to transport yourself, or to watch people at a distance.\n\nIf you become completely silent for 3 hours, and along the way identify what's in your mind that keeps bringing back that internal dialogue, and get rid of that, you're right at the door to signaling to intent that you want to change worlds.\n\nThe thing that\u2019s driving the internal dialogue will likely be \u201cimages\u201d in the mind.\n\nA teacher frowning at you in elementary school, when you weren\u2019t in the wrong.\n\nHow awkward your legs were, when you first asked that girl out.\n\nAn image of that overdue electricity bill.\n\nThat, \"I should have said THIS to him!\", kind of regret, except it's boiled down to an image at that point.\n\nEven without words, our attention focuses on this world.\n\nAs long as it\u2019s focused on this world, that\u2019s where we remain.\n\nGet rid of those images too.\n\nAt this point, magic will fill the air.  Fairies, orbs, rainbows.\n\nAll the most wonderful things that still remain in your mind will be there.\n\nBut without the hard images, you can ride on any one of them to get that to manifest more solidly.\n\nThis isn\u2019t what we\u2019re after when we want to know the ultimate about intent.\n\nThose magical things in the air are mostly where I stop. I\u2019m interested in practical magic right now, to help out my friends.  \n\nEspecially Cholita.  It's doubtful she'll live much longer unless I can figure out how to help her.  And she might kill me. She threatens often.\n\nBut to learn the deepest secrets of intent (at least at my level of sorcery), you have to find out what\u2019s liking what it sees, and not liking other things.\n\nYou have to go beyond magic.\n\nAnd a warning: You'll be sitting up on the bed when you take this final step. It's too risky to do it standing.\n\nWalking around in the dark during the first 2 stages is very good.  You can't fall asleep.\n\nBut you probably don't want to stop the world, while standing up.  Who knows what happens?\n\nYou'll have to go sit. Sitting up on the bed is bad because you'll go unconscious.  \n\nYou'll be in HEAVEN. It's everything people hype up Asian \"Enlightenment\" to be.\n\nAnd what do real people, in the real world do, when they're in Heaven?\n\nThey don't grab a staff and go looking for people to save.\n\nThey take a nap.\n\nSo if you find yourself nearly unconscious, slap your cheek.\n\nAs hard as you can, without leaving a bruise.\n\nAnd slap the other one too.  Enlightenment warrants at least a little piousness.\n\n(A Catholic joke).\n\nNow you're ready to get rid of the last traces of this world.\n\nIt\u2019s not an image in your mind. \n\nIt\u2019s not the internal dialogue.\n\nIt\u2019s a little man. \n\nCarlos might have joked, \"A little Bishop\".\n\nA guy who approves or rejects what\u2019s perceived.\n\nHe was likely built by your mom, but your dad and siblings might have had a hand in his creation.\n\nHe's your concept of \"self\", who is constantly looking for happiness, and rejecting what he believes will cause pain.\n\nHe has absolute control.  \n\nAnd he\u2019s tired of it. Very tired.\n\nBut he can\u2019t rest until you die. He has to watch every word, every sound, every sight and feeling.\n\nAnd stop the ones that are not allowed.  Otherwise, you'd drift off to God knows where.\n\nHe won't let you perceive anything outside this chicken coop we've been born into.\n\nNo problem!  \n\nTell him to take a coffee break. Get rid of him too.  But don't  have the ultimate battle and get rid of him completely.  Just tell him to take a break.\n\nHe\u2019ll actually be relieved.\n\nThen the world simply ends. It stops.\n\nYou find yourself in one of 2 places.  Or at least, I haven\u2019t seen more.\n\nOne is a blank world, of yellow color.\n\nOne is infinity. You\u2019re watching strands of glowing light, yellow or white or amber.  It\u2019s impossible at the time to look at them too closely to figure out the precise color.\n\nDon Juan called them, \"emanations\".\n\nEach one gives off a feeling.  A unique feeling.  Combine hundreds of them together, and you get a toothbrush.\n\nCombine billions together, and you get a whole world you can live in.  In fact, you already have a copy of yourself there.\n\nWe're cast into life as strings of people.  Like the beads on a chain.\n\nWe can switch to another bead at any time, if we can get silent, and have enough energy to retain consciousness.\n\nExcept, the new world is very different from this one.  Parts of it make no sense at all.\n\nStill, you know what to do there.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to combine those lines of light, or do anything at all.\n\nIntent binds them together for you, creating a bundle, and offers them as a gift, right in front of you.\n\nYou either enter, or you don\u2019t.  To enter, you only glance inside.  Turn your head that direction, and look inside.\n\nYou find yourself in another world, already having been there for as long as you can remember.\n\nBut if it hasn't been too long, you can \"turn\" your head back, and return to the view of the emanations.\n\nIt's unlikely, but if you succeed at that, and haven't read all of Carlos' books, be warned. Don't turn back and forth too many times.  Twice is fine. More than that can be hazardous.\n\nAs to getting silent during Tensegrity, we have no one here who has learned to do that.\n\nOr if they have, they aren't talking about it. Some of Carlos' apprentices chose to be \"ghosts\".\n\nI pretend they don't exist, but Cholita says they're out there.\n\nTo learn silence, I used a chair with my eyes closed, and then a darkened room with them open.\n\nOnce I\u2019m silent, I can in fact do tensegrity in silence.\n\nBut I\u2019d hate to be the one forging the path to do that from scratch.\n\nIf you can pull that off, it\u2019ll be a huge gain for this subreddit.\nI guess it\u2019s like this.\n\nIf your dad gave you $1 million dollars, and you used it for good, do you really deserve any credit?\n\nThat\u2019s my situation.\n\nIf you learn to get silent while doing tensegrity, without any other methods, you earned your $1 million.\n\nCarlos never earned his. Don Juan gave him the $1 million.\n\nI\u2019d go for the chair if you want to be silent.  \n\nIf it\u2019s too hard, learn TM. I\u2019ll guide you on how to modify that technique.\n\nI actually met Maharishi. Unfortunately, he became senile in the end and his taxi cab brother tried to take over the \"family business\".\n\nHe was the reason Hippies handed each other flowers.  He was the opposite end of Carlos Castaneda. Both created the cultural change that started in the 60s.  \n\nAlong with Bear of course.  I dated his daughter. Sort of.  She'd like to come live with me I suspect, except for Cholita being there.\n\nCarlos might have designed Cholita to capture inorganic beings, and save me from too much influence.  But surely he sent her to me, so I'd remain celibate.\n\nEdited eight times for Chinese luck", "edited": 1581816021.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fhqs2ct", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intent&lt;/em&gt; is everything.

Fairies, orbs, rainbows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All the most wonderful things that still remain in your mind will be there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But without the hard images, you can ride on any one of them to get that to manifest more solidly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn\u2019t what we\u2019re after when we want to know the ultimate about intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those magical things in the air are mostly where I stop. I\u2019m interested in practical magic right now, to help out my friends.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially Cholita.  It&amp;#39;s doubtful she&amp;#39;ll live much longer unless I can figure out how to help her.  And she might kill me. She threatens often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to learn the deepest secrets of intent (at least at my level of sorcery), you have to find out what\u2019s liking what it sees, and not liking other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to go beyond magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a warning: You&amp;#39;ll be sitting up on the bed when you take this final step. It&amp;#39;s too risky to do it standing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Walking around in the dark during the first 2 stages is very good.  You can&amp;#39;t fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you probably don&amp;#39;t want to stop the world, while standing up.  Who knows what happens?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll have to go sit. Sitting up on the bed is bad because you&amp;#39;ll go unconscious.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be in HEAVEN. It&amp;#39;s everything people hype up Asian &amp;quot;Enlightenment&amp;quot; to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what do real people, in the real world do, when they&amp;#39;re in Heaven?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t grab a staff and go looking for people to save.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They take a nap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you find yourself nearly unconscious, slap your cheek.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As hard as you can, without leaving a bruise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And slap the other one too.  Enlightenment warrants at least a little piousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(A Catholic joke).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now you&amp;#39;re ready to get rid of the last traces of this world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not an image in your mind. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a little man. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos might have joked, &amp;quot;A little Bishop&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A guy who approves or rejects what\u2019s perceived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was likely built by your mom, but your dad and siblings might have had a hand in his creation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s your concept of &amp;quot;self&amp;quot;, who is constantly looking for happiness, and rejecting what he believes will cause pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has absolute control.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he\u2019s tired of it. Very tired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he can\u2019t rest until you die. He has to watch every word, every sound, every sight and feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And stop the ones that are not allowed.  Otherwise, you&amp;#39;d drift off to God knows where.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He won&amp;#39;t let you perceive anything outside this chicken coop we&amp;#39;ve been born into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No problem!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tell him to take a coffee break. Get rid of him too.  But don&amp;#39;t  have the ultimate battle and get rid of him completely.  Just tell him to take a break.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019ll actually be relieved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the world simply ends. It stops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You find yourself in one of 2 places.  Or at least, I haven\u2019t seen more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One is a blank world, of yellow color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One is infinity. You\u2019re watching strands of glowing light, yellow or white or amber.  It\u2019s impossible at the time to look at them too closely to figure out the precise color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan called them, &amp;quot;emanations&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each one gives off a feeling.  A unique feeling.  Combine hundreds of them together, and you get a toothbrush.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Combine billions together, and you get a whole world you can live in.  In fact, you already have a copy of yourself there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re cast into life as strings of people.  Like the beads on a chain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can switch to another bead at any time, if we can get silent, and have enough energy to retain consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, the new world is very different from this one.  Parts of it make no sense at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, you know what to do there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don\u2019t have to combine those lines of light, or do anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent binds them together for you, creating a bundle, and offers them as a gift, right in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You either enter, or you don\u2019t.  To enter, you only glance inside.  Turn your head that direction, and look inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You find yourself in another world, already having been there for as long as you can remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if it hasn&amp;#39;t been too long, you can &amp;quot;turn&amp;quot; your head back, and return to the view of the emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s unlikely, but if you succeed at that, and haven&amp;#39;t read all of Carlos&amp;#39; books, be warned. Don&amp;#39;t turn back and forth too many times.  Twice is fine. More than that can be hazardous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As to getting silent during Tensegrity, we have no one here who has learned to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if they have, they aren&amp;#39;t talking about it. Some of Carlos&amp;#39; apprentices chose to be &amp;quot;ghosts&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pretend they don&amp;#39;t exist, but Cholita says they&amp;#39;re out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To learn silence, I used a chair with my eyes closed, and then a darkened room with them open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I\u2019m silent, I can in fact do tensegrity in silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I\u2019d hate to be the one forging the path to do that from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can pull that off, it\u2019ll be a huge gain for this subreddit.\nI guess it\u2019s like this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your dad gave you $1 million dollars, and you used it for good, do you really deserve any credit?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s my situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you learn to get silent while doing tensegrity, without any other methods, you earned your $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos never earned his. Don Juan gave him the $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d go for the chair if you want to be silent.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it\u2019s too hard, learn TM. I\u2019ll guide you on how to modify that technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I actually met Maharishi. Unfortunately, he became senile in the end and his taxi cab brother tried to take over the &amp;quot;family business&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was the reason Hippies handed each other flowers.  He was the opposite end of Carlos Castaneda. Both created the cultural change that started in the 60s.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along with Bear of course.  I dated his daughter. Sort of.  She&amp;#39;d like to come live with me I suspect, except for Cholita being there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos might have designed Cholita to capture inorganic beings, and save me from too much influence.  But surely he sent her to me, so I&amp;#39;d remain celibate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited eight times for Chinese luck&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null,

I get the door slammed in my face, or they back off slowly like I'm a homeless guy.\n\nBut if they'd take my advice, their reflexes would be 3 times faster, and it would be far easier to learn blocking techniques so well, that they're automatic and without thought.\n\nIf you ever got good at sparing, it was because you picked up a few \"automatic\" blocking moves.\n\nLet me talk about \"increasing awareness\".\n\nAt first, that'll be really hard to notice. If you're lucky, you can feel at least something.\n\nYou'll associate it with an \"exercise high\".\n\nThat's what you want. You want to actively feel for things that are concrete. Results that are hard to explain.\n\nTingling sensations are fantastic if you can get those.  And when you \"pour\" stuff you scoop up over yourself, just remember that eventually you'll be able to literally see what you're pouring.  So don't be afraid to pretend you can feel it, with an \"oohhhh, that feels so good\" type of attitude.\n\nI'm usually against pretending, but in the case of Tensegrity, it can help if you focus your attention on the effects that might be possible, and not just the details of the movement.\n\nTingling, exercise high, odd colors, invisible insects swishing past your feet, sensations of heat or cold.   A feeling that your hand is passing through a cobweb.\n\nAll those are possible.  Cholita and I once spent an evening at the beach, trying to follow one of those cobwebs to it's end.\n\nI also once assembled a great band of emanations, right in front of me, during a workshop.\n\nImagine an infinitely wide surface composed of lines of yellow light, stretching up in front of you at a 45 degree angle, going right through the roof and heading out into space so far you can't see the end of it.\n\nAs you gaze at it, it tries to pull you along and you have to stop looking for fear of falling over.\n\nLater, if you learn to get silent and enter heightened awareness (Zen enlightenment, but a temporary version), you'll really find out what the tensegrity is for.\n\nMy particular technique is done at night, so I can have the feeling all day the next day.\n\nYou'll be in heaven when you wake up in the morning. It is after all, the same as enlightenment. And you'll find that the descriptions of that state are accurate.\n\nBut as you sit at your desk in the office,  staring at the internet instead of working, you'll slowly loose it.\n\nThe incredible high will go away, and you'll be your old fussy, miserable self-again.\n\nMiserable compared to being enlightened that is.\n\nHere's where the big surprise comes in.\n\nJust go hide somewhere and do a few tensegrity moves, and the high comes back.\n\nYou can figure out which one works fastest, but usually it's a matter of which one can you get away with doing, before someone notices.\n\nBe prepared for real magic if you keep this up.  And your friends won't like it.\n\nEdited.", "edited": 1581713550.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fhmgeti", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;.

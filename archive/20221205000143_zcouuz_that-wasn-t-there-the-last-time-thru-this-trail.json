We are NOT studying shamanism, we're try to become \"seers\". Not at all the same.\n\nWhat we see in the Native American tribes these days is almost 100% ordinary shamanism. Rituals and drugs, with some poor knowledge of spirits, but not enough to shake their hand in person and ride around on them like Pikachu, the way the old seers could do.\n\nShamanism is largely fake, and not really worth learning if you have 55\" TVs for $115 on Amazon and 10 lifetimes of streaming media, filled with shows about magic.\n\nWe were invaded by Native Americans last year!\n\nBy the evil followers of that fraud Tata Kachora, who were worried that when he died, they couldn't take over his \"franchise\".  He claimed to be the fat stupid copy of \"the real don Juan\".\n\nThey attacked by lying to Techno about some kind of \"debate\" they'd set up with me, and then flooded us with posts of what they believed to be a rebuttal of what we do here.\n\nVideos they found on \"real shamans\".\n\nIt was all HORRIBLY lame if not \"genuine\".\n\nBut, some lineages survived from the time of the Olmecs.  Nearly all that's left is pretending (Shamanism). But there are still some lineages hiding out, and they're buddies with the head shamans at various tribes.

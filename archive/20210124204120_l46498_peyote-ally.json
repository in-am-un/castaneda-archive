Come on, tell me. Is that you, Fancy? Where&amp;#39;s Bob?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then she does a spectacular Fancy style look, and I exclaim &amp;quot;Yes! It&amp;#39;s you Fancy!!!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think she gets energy from that kind of interaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it would be nice if they all had unique smells to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good as nametags that would be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of peyote, I order 3 peyote plants for Cholita, from Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vietnam vets retired there, and many were Castaneda fans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This guy has various &amp;quot;strains&amp;quot;, and is on a mission to distribute them all over the world, so that if they are overharvested in the wild, they aren&amp;#39;t lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe I counted 10 strains on the pages I saw.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/l46498/peyoteally/gkmx1f4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1611523980.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_l46498", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gkpzjej", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gkpqzon", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;And Fairy chased Dan for some weeks,\n\nDecades, I'm afraid to say.

(&lt;em&gt;Mescalito&lt;/em&gt; can take many forms, and can be friendly or decidedly unfriendly, depending on whether he accepts you.) In Castaneda\u2019s first encounter, the dog &lt;em&gt;played&lt;/em&gt; with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dog approached and drank from a pan of water. (But don Juan kept later insisting, \u201cIt was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a dog!\u201d) Suddenly, Castaneda saw the dog become transparent. \u201cThe water was a shiny, viscous liquid. I saw it going down the dog\u2019s throat into his body. I saw it flowing evenly through his entire length and then shooting out through each one of the hairs. I saw the iridescent fluid traveling along the length of each individual hair and then projecting out of the hairs to form a long, white, silky mane.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s Little Smoke/Humito, aka Cholita&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Minx&amp;#39; (Psilocybe Mexicana) &amp;amp; Dan&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Fairy&amp;#39; (Datura/Jimsonweed) that are still hanging around. The inorganics that Carlos reached through those specific plants that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should be added that Fairy was the nagual Julian&amp;#39;s ally:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The devil&amp;#39;s weed was my benefactor&amp;#39;s ally  (Julian) TDJ,56) She distorts men. She gives them a taste of power too soon without fortifying their hearts and makes them  domineering and unpredictable. She makes them weak in the middle of their great power. There is a way to overcome it, but not to avoid it. Whoever becomes the weed&amp;#39;s ally must pay that price.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While Minx/Humito was don Juan&amp;#39;s, favored because they were easier to handle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy is helping &lt;a href=\"/u/Juann2323\"&gt;u/Juann2323&lt;/a&gt; now, and anyone else who can muster it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/l46498/peyoteally/gkpdfqh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1611581224.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_l46498", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}]

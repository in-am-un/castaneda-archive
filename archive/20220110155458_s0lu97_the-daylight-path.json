And also at the live stars.\n\nIt does pretty much work the same. There's just more distractions.  I prefer homogeneous surfaces, to help with that.\n\nAnd Juann's right, it's much harder to see brilliant puffs.\n\nBut I got to this point with stalking, and seeing puffs in daylight for weeks.\n\nThey were blue instead of purple, and looked like they were made out of dust bunnies from under the bed.\n\nNot as solid looking.  Mostly they looked like fibers.\n\nThey seemed to match Daniel Ingrams descriptions better than what one sees doing darkroom.\n\nIf you keep playing on this path, you come to realize it's all about the double.\n\nEverything is the double.\n\nThe puffs are pieces of him.  We redeploy it to the center using Tensegrity, in order to build our energy body.  Which ends up stuck to your torso, and becomes easily visible.  You end up with the double attached to your body, like those Olmec statues.\n\nThe IOBs probably only manifest on pieces of him.  By the way, that Olmec figurine showing a werejaguar using an inorganic being cat like form for a magic carpet, is likely showing why the IOBs like to play with us.\n\nThe IOBs are slow.  They like our energy, because they become faster.\n\nWhich is why that Pikachu looking IOB in the figuring has a big smile on his face.  Instead of rising on a weak puff of the double, it has the whole double right there, and is now a super speed transport.\n\nI suspect that their ability to reach out to us, from the center of the universe, is likely more related to the double, than their own abilities.\n\nMaybe the double and the iobs meet each other half way?  Both reach out?\n\nAt any rate, they're likely just \"borrowing\" a potential body when they show up in the darkroom.\n\nSo when you interreact with them enough to have them return daily, its possible you simply \"lent\" a puff to them for permanent usage.  Which implies, just because they can manifest for you, your friend won't necessarily be able to perceive them, because he needs to reassign a puff of  his own, for that interface.\n\nThey don't need enough \"puff chi\" for you to miss it.  They just need some connection, and I do believe it's through that puff energy which is merely the double, dispersed to the edges of your luminous shell.\n\nI'm not convinced there's any of him outside our shell!  \n\nHe can project himself all the way across the  universe, but my bet is, he's still inside the shell, the same as our Tonal. It's his glow of awareness that projects, not actually him?\n\nSome of  the passes manipulate the energy of the double in front of you, and then at the end you scoop it into you.\n\n\"Affection for the Energy Body\".\n\nDoing that pass while you can literally see the puffs form a head, shoulders, hips, and legs, introduces a new level of \"creepiness\" into the dark room.\n\nThe word \"creepy\" implies something bad, but in fact it's the coveted state where a tingle starts at  your toes, and ripples up your body and spine, until the top of your head has the tingle.  And goosebumps form all along the way.\n\nIt means, the assemblage point is now easily movable.\n\nIf you hear a snap or pop in the neck, you can indeed get the double to come out at that point.\n\nLast week I got sucked outside bundling, into raw dark sea.  I had formed a phantom room, and Fancy helped me \"cut\" a window in it.  A window to outside that phantom room.\n\nNot to outside my bedroom.  There's a distinction.\n\nPortals in  your bedroom lead \"somewhere\".  \n\nThis one led nowhere. It was \"null space\".\n\nA swarm of beings was  out there, trying to push into my phantom room.    A good 20 had already managed to come in and make themselves visible.\n\nI found myself literally leaning through my solid bedroom wall, as real as anything, and the swarm was sucking on me, to pull me outside.\n\nOne of my inorganic beings grabbed my leg, to stop me from being sucked out of the room.  It was probably Fancy.\n\nI heard a snap in my neck, and my double flew out into the midst of the visitors.\n\nThat's all they wanted.   \n\n\nTo say hi.\n\nSo those of you expecting that the goal of darkroom is more and more vivid sights, that's all true.\n\nAnd being able to switch to your double, and leave the dark room physically, is also nice.\n\nAs is silent knowledge!  Although silent knowledge is very distracting.\n\nThose are all still not really the goal.\n\nIt's the double.  To integrate him better, with your tonal.\n\nCarlos told us in Silent Knowledge, but it's easy to overlook that.  He said, \"the double becomes visible\".\n\nThat statement has a lot more meaning than you'd notice from a normal point of view.\n\nWhen you get the double to be a little more obvious in your darkroom (or daytime gazing) he sort of takes over a higher percentage of your tonal.\n\nOr at the very least, in order to see the coolest stuff in the darkroom, you need his eyes.\n\nOnce you have to  use his eyes to do what you are doing (far orange zone, where Silent Knowledge takes over),  you are \"walking a mile in his shoes\" so to speak.\n\nIt produces a change in how you feel about darkroom.\n\nInstead of \"putting in your time\", you change to just hanging out where you like to hang out, and observing the sights.\n\nYou're where you want to be, instead of where you have to be.\n\nI suppose it's the same as if you decide to learn to play the trumpet.\n\nAt first, you put in 30 minutes a day because if you don't, the junior high school band teacher will be on your back.\n\nBut at some point you actually enjoy playing it, and a complete change happens.\n\nYou end up playing in a jazz band that has no where to actually play for the public,  and you start eating soggy sandwiches from the liquor store, next to the cans of mixed drinks.\n\nJust kidding...  But not completely.\n\nWhat happens if you \"hang out\" in your double is, you notice how to navigate silence, and feel the movement of the assemblage point.\n\nSo that during the day, instead of fighting to remove your internal dialogue, you can \"swim\" in being almost silent, looking for sensations that indicate you're succeeding.\n\nYou walk around being slightly pushed back and forth in an invisible lake that has slow ripples.\n\nYou find yourself \"feeling silence\" instead of forcing  it.\n\nI guess Carlos would say, you got \"saturated\".\n\nOnce you are saturated with the search for silence, and can feel results even during the day, results that come naturally, you begin to notice the abstract in the environment.\n\nThere's \"the abstract\" even in daylight!\n\nIf you find a \"patch\" of the abstract, it's consistently in the direction you were looking when you detected it, and it's connected to something there.\n\nIt can push you back to a very remote memory of something extremely pleasant, but impossible to describe or explain.\n\nSuch as, the homeless woman laying in a little pile of dirty clothes next to the  used car dealership where no one ever picks up the trash,  causes you to plunge into a memory of the beach, and an amazing breeze that was blowing over you at 5 years old, creating a feeling that magic is everywhere.\n\nWhen you feel that for a while, it expands into a bubble and  you realize.\n\nYou really do need to keep recapitulating...", "edited": 1641828996.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hs2m1gk", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Cholita gone, I&amp;#39;ve had a chance to do a little gazing in daylight.

Doing 2-6 hours a day of it.\n\nBut as for doing it again,  yes as time goes by, you have to.\n\nBut it's even better if you can reach \"Silent Knowledge\" and do it using that.  So I'd recommend, if you did a good job, why not learn to get silent next?\n\nMy hard efforts at recap are possibly why I'm able to do waking dreaming more easily than others.  But mostly it's because I put in the time to learn to be silent, as both don Juan and Carlos insisted you must.\n\nAlso, always read ALL of the books.\n\nDidn't you notice that your recap is not much like Carlos wrote about it?\n\nEverything in the books works exactly as written, including crazy magic.\n\nRecap is supposed to be INTENSELY magical.\n\nGoing back in time to relive past events. \n\nGoing back in time to relive other people's events.\n\nIf there's no magic going on, you aren't doing it right.\n\nInorganic beings come to visit and try to implant false memories.\n\nThey'll even open up a tunnel to their world, while you are in the middle of recap.\n\nThe same tunnel Carol Tiggs pushed me into, and another workshop person, when she did her demonstrations of magic under pressure from Carlos.\n\nYour double comes out if you are doing recap correctly, and you find yourself on the other side of the house when you thought you were doing recap elsewhere.\n\nYou were!  You just activated your double. You're in 2 places in your home.\n\nYou can even share dreaming with someone else, and view each other's recapped past events live.   As if you were both really there.\n\nBut best of all, when you can move your assemblage point to where Carlos told us to move it in his last 5 publications (Especially \"Readers of Infinity\"),  recap becomes FULLY visible.\n\nYou see fibers of yellowish, orange or white light, connecting your torso to events far out in space.\n\nRight in front of you.\n\nThose are the fibers of awareness you have stuck in past events, which you inhale while doing recap.\n\nAnd there are some from other people, stuck in you.\n\nYou literally, visibly see those being sucked back to you, or blown out with your breath if they were from someone else.\n\nOnce those are visible you can focus on one, and see a video of that memory playing in the distance.\n\nLike on the cover of Wheel of time, where the old seer has summoned a view of the phases of  the moon, in the sky.\n\nThat's \"Silent Knowledge\"!\n\nAnd it works just like that book cover.\n\nYou can zoom that in with your gaze, and just watch the past events play like an entertaining TV show.\n\nNo more struggle to remember.\n\nBut if you want to remember deliberately, you can enter into any of the scenes as if you were back in time living there.\n\nAnd float up into the air 50-100 feet, so you can get a view of that place where the event took place. You'll find 10 times more memories that way.\n\nRecap should be intensely magical, or it indicates you aren't doing it long enough for your assemblage point to move that far (2 hours is ideal), or that you're sitting there fantasizing, instead of only remembering the past events.\n\nBest if you can get fully silent so there isn't even any internal dialogue to speak of.  Just what's needed to \"straighten out a list\" of events.\n\nI'm afraid, no one seems to be doing recap properly as defined in the books and publications of Carlos.\n\nThey ignore the magic part and just pretend.\n\nMy guess? They're only doing 30 minutes at a time, and aren't even able to stop fantasizing in their mind, because they never put in the effort to learn to be silent.\n\nIt still works though.  To increase your energy.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is, this subreddit exists because neither Miles nor Reni were teaching anything that produced real magic for their customers.\n\nOtherwise we wouldn't bother to work so  hard in here, for free.\n\nThe reputation of Carlos sunk deep into the toilet, with everyone claiming he was  a fraud.\n\nWhen in fact everything else out there is the fraud.\n\nHe had the only real magic around!\n\nBut neither Reni or Miles protected his reputation.\n\nI don't know why.  Maybe Carol insisted they not change anything, in anticipation of one of the many \"factions\" Carlos created, becoming active.\n\nCarlos had \"contingency plans\" all over the place.\n\nSo we're stuck doing that for now.  Trying to teach people to follow the instructions Carlos gave them.\n\nIn my case, Carlos released his Allies to a private class and they started pestering me for decades until they finally blackmailed me to come here and help fix this horrible situation.\n\nJust want you to know where you are. \n\nPeople were wondering why you wandered into here.\n\nThe students of Miles and Reni don't seem to care at all about making the magic work.\n\nSo this place tends to upset them.\n\nThey've focused on attention seeking with Cleargreen or Miles, instead of on magic.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j47xupj", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll certainly get back more energy to use for dreaming if you do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started an excessive recap a year or two before Carlos let me into private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He even referred to it to shame some women who weren&amp;#39;t putting much effort into that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finished it 2 years into classes.

As if you were both really there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But best of all, when you can move your assemblage point to where Carlos told us to move it in his last 5 publications (Especially &amp;quot;Readers of Infinity&amp;quot;),  recap becomes FULLY visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see fibers of yellowish, orange or white light, connecting your torso to events far out in space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are the fibers of awareness you have stuck in past events, which you inhale while doing recap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there are some from other people, stuck in you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You literally, visibly see those being sucked back to you, or blown out with your breath if they were from someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once those are visible you can focus on one, and see a video of that memory playing in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like on the cover of Wheel of time, where the old seer has summoned a view of the phases of  the moon, in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Silent Knowledge&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it works just like that book cover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can zoom that in with your gaze, and just watch the past events play like an entertaining TV show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No more struggle to remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you want to remember deliberately, you can enter into any of the scenes as if you were back in time living there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And float up into the air 50-100 feet, so you can get a view of that place where the event took place. You&amp;#39;ll find 10 times more memories that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recap should be intensely magical, or it indicates you aren&amp;#39;t doing it long enough for your assemblage point to move that far (2 hours is ideal), or that you&amp;#39;re sitting there fantasizing, instead of only remembering the past events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best if you can get fully silent so there isn&amp;#39;t even any internal dialogue to speak of.  Just what&amp;#39;s needed to &amp;quot;straighten out a list&amp;quot; of events.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid, no one seems to be doing recap properly as defined in the books and publications of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They ignore the magic part and just pretend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess? They&amp;#39;re only doing 30 minutes at a time, and aren&amp;#39;t even able to stop fantasizing in their mind, because they never put in the effort to learn to be silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It still works though.  To increase your energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the fact of the matter is, this subreddit exists because neither Miles nor Reni were teaching anything that produced real magic for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise we wouldn&amp;#39;t bother to work so  hard in here, for free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reputation of Carlos sunk deep into the toilet, with everyone claiming he was  a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When in fact everything else out there is the fraud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had the only real magic around!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But neither Reni or Miles protected his reputation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why.  Maybe Carol insisted they not change anything, in anticipation of one of the many &amp;quot;factions&amp;quot; Carlos created, becoming active.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos had &amp;quot;contingency plans&amp;quot; all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#39;re stuck doing that for now.  Trying to teach people to follow the instructions Carlos gave them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case, Carlos released his Allies to a private class and they started pestering me for decades until they finally blackmailed me to come here and help fix this horrible situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just want you to know where you are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People were wondering why you wandered into here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The students of Miles and Reni don&amp;#39;t seem to care at all about making the magic work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this place tends to upset them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ve focused on attention seeking with Cleargreen or Miles, instead of on magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_10ab8ze", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/10ab8ze/bad_players_at_being_energy/j47xupj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1673640258.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1673640258.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j47tr8c", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "coyyotl55", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j47mivm", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_c1z7e3wm", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I found I needed another round of recap, based on things Carlos said in workshop/interview, can't remember exactly.

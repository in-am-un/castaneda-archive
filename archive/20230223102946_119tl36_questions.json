You have to teach yourself.\n\nNo one in the history of our sorcery has ever taught an adult individual.\n\nBut that's a complex topic.\n\nUnfortunately, even Carlos failed to teach any individuals.\n\nIt's just not how our sorcery came to be.\n\nNow, my personal advice?\n\nMust do Life Saver Pass.\n\nMust do Mashing Energy pass.\n\nGood to do Running Man series\n\nGood to do \"Stellar Hatch\" so that you bring down some alien energy to mix in with your own.\n\nGood to do \"Affection for the Energy body\", so that your double starts to help you out while practicing.\n\nAnd then pick 2 more.\n\nThe \"series\" stores magic.\n\nAny tensegrity form, long or individual movement, \"stores intent\".\n\nMeaning magic starts to happen more and more, each day you do it.\n\nIt \"stores\" into the form.\n\nBut when you have a \"series\" of forms, you can accomplish complex tasks.\n\nI use around 6 to erect a phantom train station in my darkroom, complete with scenery all around me, and a connection to the ley lines of the earth.\n\nAll fully visible.\n\nInside there I get visitors.  Cholita looked in to see what was up last night.\n\nSo the individual forms teach you what happens if you do them, with no internal dialogue.\n\nMagic.\n\nBut having a set of  them that you do every night, lets you do just about anything.\n\nYou could cause a magic carpet to materialize on the floor, step on, and fly through the ceiling to go look around your city.\n\nI'm not kidding.  That's what sorcery can do.\n\nJust make sure you don't fall into the \"Chi Gung Delusion\".\n\nChi Gung is absolute nonsense, made up to steal money from the naive.\n\nBut even in China they don't take it seriously. It's old people morning exercise, and a chance to get together and chat about grandkids in local parks.\n\nSome very bad western men saw it, and decided to misrepresent it and sell it to stupid westerners.\n\nIt doesn't actually do anything.\n\nBut it makes people feel like you can do special movements, and those work like \"vitamins\".\n\nOr make you stronger.  Or give you more \"chi energy\", as if that were going to produce any effect.\n\nIt never does.\n\nThe Tensegrity also can fall into that delusion, and you'll get next to nothing from it.\n\nThat's also proven over the last 27 years since Carlos was teaching it.\n\nThis week we saw some Russians bemoaning the loss of their group practice leader, who they claimed could \"move their assemblage point\".\n\nMeaning, they got a sense of something in their mind, doing it around that person.\n\nBut people get the same out of con artists.  Or with hypnotists. Or religious leaders.\n\nWhat we want is MAGIC IN YOUR FACE.  As amazing as any movie special effects.\n\nDon't fall into the \"vitamin\" trap thinking Tensegrity is going to work without you actually figuring out how to make that happen.\n\nSilence is how  that happens.\n\nOf course there's alternatives to what I said.  Juann does it in full sunlight, and now that he knows how to move his assemblage point, possibly doesn't even have to do the tensegrity, if there's too many people around.", "edited": 1677258682.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j9uec7b", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleargreen has videos #1, 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With descriptions and then the passes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a pointer to those in the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you say &amp;quot;dreaming&amp;quot;, you worry me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Read around a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men who took the &amp;quot;dreaming&amp;quot; path all failed.

You have to teach yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one in the history of our sorcery has ever taught an adult individual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s a complex topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even Carlos failed to teach any individuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just not how our sorcery came to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, my personal advice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Must do Life Saver Pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Must do Mashing Energy pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good to do Running Man series&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good to do &amp;quot;Stellar Hatch&amp;quot; so that you bring down some alien energy to mix in with your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good to do &amp;quot;Affection for the Energy body&amp;quot;, so that your double starts to help you out while practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then pick 2 more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;series&amp;quot; stores magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any tensegrity form, long or individual movement, &amp;quot;stores intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning magic starts to happen more and more, each day you do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It &amp;quot;stores&amp;quot; into the form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you have a &amp;quot;series&amp;quot; of forms, you can accomplish complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use around 6 to erect a phantom train station in my darkroom, complete with scenery all around me, and a connection to the ley lines of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All fully visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside there I get visitors.  Cholita looked in to see what was up last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the individual forms teach you what happens if you do them, with no internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But having a set of  them that you do every night, lets you do just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could cause a magic carpet to materialize on the floor, step on, and fly through the ceiling to go look around your city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not kidding.  That&amp;#39;s what sorcery can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just make sure you don&amp;#39;t fall into the &amp;quot;Chi Gung Delusion&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chi Gung is absolute nonsense, made up to steal money from the naive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even in China they don&amp;#39;t take it seriously. It&amp;#39;s old people morning exercise, and a chance to get together and chat about grandkids in local parks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some very bad western men saw it, and decided to misrepresent it and sell it to stupid westerners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t actually do anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it makes people feel like you can do special movements, and those work like &amp;quot;vitamins&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or make you stronger.  Or give you more &amp;quot;chi energy&amp;quot;, as if that were going to produce any effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It never does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tensegrity also can fall into that delusion, and you&amp;#39;ll get next to nothing from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s also proven over the last 27 years since Carlos was teaching it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This week we saw some Russians bemoaning the loss of their group practice leader, who they claimed could &amp;quot;move their assemblage point&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, they got a sense of something in their mind, doing it around that person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But people get the same out of con artists.  Or with hypnotists. Or religious leaders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we want is MAGIC IN YOUR FACE.  As amazing as any movie special effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t fall into the &amp;quot;vitamin&amp;quot; trap thinking Tensegrity is going to work without you actually figuring out how to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence is how  that happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course there&amp;#39;s alternatives to what I said.  Juann does it in full sunlight, and now that he knows how to move his assemblage point, possibly doesn&amp;#39;t even have to do the tensegrity, if there&amp;#39;s too many people around.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_119tl36", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/119tl36/questions/j9uec7b/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1677258397.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1677258397.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j9ua1yv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "BabboSRL2626", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j9tvhpx", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_v2qce07i", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Sorry again, what magical passes do you advise me to do as a beginner particularly interested in dreaming?

Or in the books, \"Dreaming Awake\".\n\nYou see the pictures!\n\nMost of the dreaming in the books, is awake. Not asleep.\n\nWaking dreaming is far better than sleeping dreaming.\n\nSo what usually happens is, men who take the path you're proposing lie their butts off to get attention.\n\nAnd start taking any dream they can remember as a success.\n\nThey come here and make pests of themselves, and I have to stop them and become subject to a giant tantrum.\n\nThey become GIANT obstacles to our community.\n\nWe even get other bad men \"interviewing\" such fakers on youtube.\n\nFor their \"great dreaming abilities\".  Of which they have absolutely none.\n\nAnd in fact, they never followed those instructions in \"Art of Dreaming\" at all.\n\nFound their hands maybe 4 times over 5 years, then after that they just lied.\n\nBecause everyone else does.\n\nBesides, you're misreading the books.  Did you read all of them?\n\nThere's 17 publications.\n\nCarlos was practicing the right way of walking many hours a week, don Juan was slapping him on the back and pulling him into waking dreaming, and endless other things were being done to \"teach\" him.\n\nWhile he was doing art of dreaming techniques.\n\nThat dreaming thing was just a small part of his activity, and NOT a path to learn sorcery.\n\nIt is not.\n\nYou didn't read well.\n\nOr if you did read all of the books, you weren't thinking it through.\n\nLet me think up an analogy...\n\nYou work on a farm. Tossing huge bails of hay all day long.\n\nAnd that old tractor the farm has is so bad, you have to pull it out of the dirt twice a day, using just your muscles.\n\nPlus there's endless calves to pick up and put back in their stalls.\n\nHeavy work all day long!\n\nYou go to the gym too!\n\nAt the gym some scrawny guy asks how you got to be so strong and muscular?\n\nYou point him to the weight machines and tell him those help.\n\nNot mentioning, you WORK ON A FARM ALL DAY LONG.\n\nHowever, not to disappoint you.\n\nI put a HUGE effort into that path.\n\nBut I was also doing all the other things Carlos told us to do.  All of them.\n\nAnd I got so good at what you want to learn, that I could wake up in my dreams 6 times a night.\n\nI could stay in them for 12 hours on rare occasions.  But always several hours.\n\nSo instead of 10 seconds, which is typical, I could spend 2 hours at least every single night, inside dreams experimenting and following the instructions from that book.\n\nI found the scouts, battled with them, learned to dissolve them with my gaze, and chased them from mountain to mountain.  Until finally they took me to their world.\n\nSo I could learn from them.\n\nJust as in the books.\n\nThen I learned to go to sleep inside dreams, 3 levels deep.\n\nNot dreamt I did that!\n\nNot misinterpreted a wacky nightmare.\n\nI consciously woke up, found my hands to prove I was fully ready to follow instructions, and then I did exactly what Carlos told us in that book.\n\nUntil eventually I got so far in dreams in dreams, that I couldn't wake up!\n\nI'd panic at wakeup #10 where I was absolutely sure I'd escaped, and even took a shower and drove halfway to work.\n\nOnly to find the streets were covered in weird beasts.\n\nSo I was still asleep.\n\nI eventually learned how to \"wake up\", but never did I \"wake up in the real copy of my room\".\n\nI gained some dreaming skills, but that path is mostly just a trick if you ask me.\n\nBecause using darkroom you can bring your double right into the room, and see it sitting there on the edge of the bed.\n\nOr it will superimpose itself over you, and you have 3 arms now!\n\nLike Pablito in eagle's gift or second ring, with his 3rd hand trying to attack Carlos.\n\nI get visits from witches. The real thing!  In waking dreams.\n\nOne leads me to walk right through the solid walls if she comes to visit.\n\nI spend hours each night with my 3 allies.\n\nCarlos lent us his when he died.\n\nThe \"Art of Dreaming\" path never works for anyone.  Everyone has failed trying to do that.\n\nBecause in fact NO ONE HAS EVER learned that way.\n\nWho?  When?\n\nThe Olmecs (\"old seers\") were given very young children to teach.\n\nThe \"new seers\" had entire lineages, with 15 members helping each apprentice in many ways, not to mention \"the nagual's blow\".\n\nNO ONE has ever learned by that dreaming path. It's only a pipe dream.\n\nIf you want to try, I'd be happy to help.\n\nBut you won't be able to find your hands more than once a month.\n\nIf even that.\n\nTo master that path, you need 3 years of finding your hands 2 times a night or more.\n\nWhy bother?  That's a lot more work than our darkroom using Tensegrity to lure out your double.\n\nBut I'd be tickled pink if you got serious.\n\nFor me it's sort of like, having a big crush on the cute coffee shop girl.\n\nBut being too old to do anything about it.\n\nSo I'd love to know someone who got to date her.\n\nAnd be happy to tell him what I learned about her, if that might help.", "edited": 1677184854.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_j9pg1qx", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to stop in the dream, realize it&amp;#39;s a dream, and look at your hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any more details than that you don&amp;#39;t need, because they won&amp;#39;t help you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bitch!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typical is that on hearing of it, people can do it once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then never again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone who works extremely hard (silence your mind as you lay waiting to sleep, with the intention of seeing dream visions and walking right into dreaming from laying there) might get to have one per month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s jack shit!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do 3 hours every single day without fail, of waking dreaming.

Until finally they took me to their world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I could learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I learned to go to sleep inside dreams, 3 levels deep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not dreamt I did that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not misinterpreted a wacky nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I consciously woke up, found my hands to prove I was fully ready to follow instructions, and then I did exactly what Carlos told us in that book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until eventually I got so far in dreams in dreams, that I couldn&amp;#39;t wake up!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d panic at wakeup #10 where I was absolutely sure I&amp;#39;d escaped, and even took a shower and drove halfway to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only to find the streets were covered in weird beasts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I was still asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I eventually learned how to &amp;quot;wake up&amp;quot;, but never did I &amp;quot;wake up in the real copy of my room&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gained some dreaming skills, but that path is mostly just a trick if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because using darkroom you can bring your double right into the room, and see it sitting there on the edge of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or it will superimpose itself over you, and you have 3 arms now!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Pablito in eagle&amp;#39;s gift or second ring, with his 3rd hand trying to attack Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get visits from witches. The real thing!  In waking dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One leads me to walk right through the solid walls if she comes to visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spend hours each night with my 3 allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos lent us his when he died.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Art of Dreaming&amp;quot; path never works for anyone.  Everyone has failed trying to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because in fact NO ONE HAS EVER learned that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who?  When?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Olmecs (&amp;quot;old seers&amp;quot;) were given very young children to teach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;new seers&amp;quot; had entire lineages, with 15 members helping each apprentice in many ways, not to mention &amp;quot;the nagual&amp;#39;s blow&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NO ONE has ever learned by that dreaming path. It&amp;#39;s only a pipe dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to try, I&amp;#39;d be happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you won&amp;#39;t be able to find your hands more than once a month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If even that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To master that path, you need 3 years of finding your hands 2 times a night or more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why bother?  That&amp;#39;s a lot more work than our darkroom using Tensegrity to lure out your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;d be tickled pink if you got serious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me it&amp;#39;s sort of like, having a big crush on the cute coffee shop girl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But being too old to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;d love to know someone who got to date her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And be happy to tell him what I learned about her, if that might help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/119tl36/questions/j9pg1qx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1677172494.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_119tl36", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j9t0moq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "BabboSRL2626", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1677233312.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j9o3kk8", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_v2qce07i", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "No, I am not a woman.

People go around jumping on one leg to get to the 7-11 for a Slurpee and chips, and pretend to be making sorcery progress.\n\nThey do that for decades in some cases!  Because really, they have no actual interest in learning sorcery.\n\nNot-doings were only useful in the books when don Juan and group were using the nagual's blow in the background, to teach apprentices.\n\nWhose assemblage points had traveled all over, unknown to them, and were very flexible. Just had a tiny \"crust\" on the top they had to overcome, to see visible magic.\n\nAnd the apprentices were also working their butts off, to learn to be silent.  The efforts of Carlos to learn silence are legendary!  And he was doing that from the very day in the books, that don Juan told him to.\n\nWithout that, the effect of a not-doing is too tiny to have any noticeable benefit.\n\nThey light up emanations in the dark sea, which are normally not used.\n\nThat gives a very very tiny chance that if you are silent and the assemblage point drifts, you can make it drift to a seldom used skimming of emanations, and perceive something \"weird\".\n\nIf you gaze at the weirdness, you can move it further.\n\nBut on their own, they're just wishful thinking.\n\nThat of course doesn't really apply to women.\n\nBecause they can move their assemblage points without doing all the hard work of darkroom.\n\nSo that anything which gives them confidence, and maybe anything that lights up seldom used emanations, might be enough for them to move their assemblage points dramatically.\n\nI just don't like to encourage that type of thinking, because the inverse is also true.\n\nIf you convince women that even the smallest thing like a not-doing can help them, and it doesn't, they get the feeling this is all pretending.\n\nAnd what they need more than anything else, is confidence.\n\nNot for \"weird stuff to happen\". Women are swimming in weirdness all of their lives.\n\nAlso, if women go directly into dreaming using the womb as a focus, the not-doings have a residual effect on the obsessions of their double.  A positive effect in that they disrupt the routines of the double.\n\nWith his routines disrupted, even a small amount of rationality brought in from the Tonal awareness has a chance to guide his actions that night.\n\nFrom a male perspective, not-doings are like buying flowers for your grumpy wife, before you go out together.\n\nDoesn't work on Cholita. She'll fashion the flower vase into a dagger, and position it under your heart, below the bed.

People go around jumping on one leg to get to the 7-11 for a Slurpee and chips, and pretend to be making sorcery progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They do that for decades in some cases!  Because really, they have no actual interest in learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not-doings were only useful in the books when don Juan and group were using the nagual&amp;#39;s blow in the background, to teach apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whose assemblage points had traveled all over, unknown to them, and were very flexible. Just had a tiny &amp;quot;crust&amp;quot; on the top they had to overcome, to see visible magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the apprentices were also working their butts off, to learn to be silent.  The efforts of Carlos to learn silence are legendary!  And he was doing that from the very day in the books, that don Juan told him to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without that, the effect of a not-doing is too tiny to have any noticeable benefit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They light up emanations in the dark sea, which are normally not used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gives a very very tiny chance that if you are silent and the assemblage point drifts, you can make it drift to a seldom used skimming of emanations, and perceive something &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you gaze at the weirdness, you can move it further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But on their own, they&amp;#39;re just wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That of course doesn&amp;#39;t really apply to women.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they can move their assemblage points without doing all the hard work of darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that anything which gives them confidence, and maybe anything that lights up seldom used emanations, might be enough for them to move their assemblage points dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t like to encourage that type of thinking, because the inverse is also true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you convince women that even the smallest thing like a not-doing can help them, and it doesn&amp;#39;t, they get the feeling this is all pretending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what they need more than anything else, is confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not for &amp;quot;weird stuff to happen&amp;quot;. Women are swimming in weirdness all of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if women go directly into dreaming using the womb as a focus, the not-doings have a residual effect on the obsessions of their double.

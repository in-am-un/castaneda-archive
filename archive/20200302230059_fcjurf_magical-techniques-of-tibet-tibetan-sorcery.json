I've found Tibetan Buddhism a bit tough to get into for Westerners, specifically due to the Tibetan language itself being heavily used (naturally) most texts.\n\n*Magical Techniques of Tibet by J.H. Brennan* is a rather good introduction for us non-Buddhist/non-Tibetans. Here are some passages from the prologue:\n\n\"Tibetan Buddhists believe your solid-seeming world is an illusion. Like the heroes of the movie The Matrix, a small number of them work hard to break through the illusion to the reality beyond, and some have high hopes that all of humanity will eventually realize the way things really are. They are also aware, from bitter personal experience, that simply believing the world to be unreal is not enough to change anything. Rigorous effort and yogic training are both required to break down the conditioning that holds us in our natural matrix.\n\nMost intriguing of all, Tibetan philosophers have tackled one of the most difficult questions to arise out of the doctrines of Buddhism: if all is illusion, what is the point of morality and correct behavior? Their answer is twofold. First, experience shows that correct behavior and morality are important in escaping the illusion. Secondly, those of us who remain locked in the unreal world of *sangsara* have no option but to obey its rules, just as those who failed to recognize the matrix for what it was were forced to function  within its rigid program. While the illusion is maintained, we have the choice of generating positive karma and consequently improving the quality of our future life.\n\nTibetan sorcerers go one step further. Like the characters in The Matrix, they prefer the illusory world to the reality beyond, but study its mechanics in order to perform miracles. In essence, they believe that if our world is the product of mind, then control of the mind must lead to control of our environment; what is made by mind can be changed by mind.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Over centuries of isolation, this unique culture investigated the mysteries of mind and magic to a degree never before attempted. Only the civilization of ancient Egypt came close to the understanding and insight developed in Tibet. Tibet was the magical capital of our planet.\n\nTibet underwent a profound change with the Chinese invasion of 1950. Until then, an astonishing 25 percent of the population was fully occupied with spiritual pursuits. But the monasteries dispatched no missionaries and for centuries the number of foreign visitors who reached Tibet was minuscule. (Just before the Second World War, there were only six Europeans in the entire country.) Tibet kept its secrets to itself.\n\nWhen the People's Liberation Army marched across the border, the situation changed. Communist China agreed with Karl Marx that religion is the opiate of the people. The new masters of Tibet saw the monasteries not as repositories of spiritual wisdom but as parasites supported by the sweat of ignorance and set about closing them down. Many of those who had previously devoted their lives to an investigation of spiritual realities became forced labor for the new regime. China replaced the old religion with its own philosophy of materialism and did everything it could to break the back of traditional Tibetan culture.\n\nThis development, ugly and brutal though it was, had one positive aspect. While a long dark night settled over Tibet itself, the seeds of Tibetan spirituality began, for the first time in centuries, to be broadcast more widely. Centers of Tibetan culture were established by monastic refugees in America, Britain, Europe, and Ireland. Tibetan masters began to write their own books and explain the spiritual work and insights of their native country. Their teaching has been widely welcomed.\n\nBut if Tibetan spirituality is spreading, the same cannot be said for Tibetan magic. This body of techniques, based partly on Buddhist practice and partly on shamanic Bon (the aboriginal religion of Tibet), has scarcely been investigated by Western occultists. This is a pity because Tibetan magic, which in many of its aspects links seamlessly with Tibetan mysticism, has a great deal to teach the esoteric community of the West.\"\n\nFrom the epilogue:\n\n\"How seriously should we take all this? The idea that magic works because life is an illusion runs contrary to the whole thrust of Western religious thought and almost all the Western-based philosophies. But it does receive support from one unexpected quarter: the world of physics.\n\n...physicists eventually realized the entire solid, physical universe was made from nothing. This is a chilling discovery. The ultimate bedrock of manifestation, which, of course, includes your physical body and mine, is a void filled with quantum foam made up of particles that emerge briefly from nothingness before disappearing again. Furthermore, whether anything exists at all is a question of probability rather than certainty.\n\n...This means your mind, the human mind, or possibly just mind without qualification, is actively involved in the universe as a whole. It actually influences certain events at the quantum level. The outcome is that physicists have begun to postulate a basic unity of phenomena, the sort of oneness that mystics claim to be the ultimate reality.\n\nPut all this together and what do you get? You get a phenomenal world that looks wonderfully solid but is ultimately an illusion created by the random motion of tiny bits of mystery that emerge from the void and return to the void in a perpetual dance influenced by the action of mind. That sounds suspiciously like Tibetan mysticism to me.\"", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Magical Techniques of Tibet (Tibetan Sorcery)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Buddhism"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"g27gugyun4l41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 55, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g27gugyun4l41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=220ed5466ce3281c6c686a05e7fb6739f50e05e3"}, {"y": 111, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g27gugyun4l41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6ce99e50405050d9ddf04d08122258eddf17948"}, {"y": 165, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g27gugyun4l41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b01dd171a7191fba75ac3abcf986834ea43a708"}], "s": {"y": 258, "x": 500, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/g27gugyun4l41.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a575e1ed48d3a4f3d773c28f94b67a4272e309a1"}, "id": "g27gugyun4l41"}}, "name": "t3_fcjurf", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 19, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Buddhism", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 19, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9VM3ebd40PBaYep_8KEdvYtJvrjUjBFPhycWnxLR9LU.jpg", "edited": 1583533264.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1583186459.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/g27gugyun4l41.jpg?width=500&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a575e1ed48d3a4f3d773c28f94b67a4272e309a1\"&gt;Milarepa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PDF link:  &lt;a href=\"https://kupdf.net/download/brennan-magical-techniques-of-tibet-pdf_5afb1d7de2b6f574403bcae0_pdf\"&gt;https://kupdf.net/download/brennan-magical-techniques-of-tibet-pdf_5afb1d7de2b6f574403bcae0_pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s been mention of the Tibetan Dzogchen tradition on the subreddit recently.

All my abhorrence about this shitty  world and my grief about this fascinating magical being becoming a worthless pretender -a flyer among flyers- cannot move my ass one inch towards the task that frees me.  Something tells me it needs something to be done before getting to the dark room.

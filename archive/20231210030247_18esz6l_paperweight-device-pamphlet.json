Where you sit there with closed eyes and pretend that when you doze off out of boredom and inactivity,  and have a little dream you can remember, it's a success.  Which you can go brag about to your like minded friends.\n\nVadim likely just gave little dream naps a new name. \n\nReality surfing.\n\nSame trick Monroe used.  And the good news is, Monroe's assistant (likely more guilty than Monroe since he scammed the CIA too) is feeling the heat these days.\n\nHe's got \"interviews\" on Youtube with him complaining about people criticizing him too harshly lately. \n\nWith what's likely Monroe's greedy daughter doing the interviewing.\n\nGive men a chance to lie and pretend to have magical powers, and you'll find plenty who will go along with that.\n\nThey're actually just looking for a low cost endorsement for their own franchise.\n\nWe get those too:  Endorsement shoppers.\n\nTony Karim was an endorsement shopper.  Which is why we lost him to that obvious fraud the Dali Lama.\n\nEven real \"Zen Masters\" will tell you the Dali Lama is a total fraud! \n\nI've seen them do that to their monks.\n\nBut there's ALWAYS a money making scheme behind any \"spirituality\".\n\nCarlos once asked us how the ENTIRE world could be so uniformly brainwashed???\n\nThinking we'd see how impossible that is, without some outside force causing it.\n\nWith not a single human being escaping the blue line reality delusions.  Not even on an isolated island, practicing their 6000 year old Islander magic passed down from the Austronesians.\n\nSure, isolated humans in isolated cultures have their own scams for stealing money based on pretending magic. Even if they're only scamming the village.\n\nAnd foreign bad guys go looking for that kind of thing.\n\nSomething exotic enough to give outsiders \"hope\".\n\nSo they can import it and cash in themselves.\n\nBut all essentially the same thing.  And void of any significant magical content.\n\nA pyramid scheme of sorts.\n\nOnce you start navigating the dark sea and realize being human is only a tiny bit of the entire thing, and that human obsessions are the very things which prevent free exploration of all of it, you can understand why Carlos was mystified that EVERYONE is stuck at that position of the assemblage point.\n\nBut until you \"see it with your own eyes\", meaning you're gazing at an entire reality for which you can't even find one single suitable word so that you could explain it to someone the next day, you realize how universally hooked we are on the blue line self-absorbed \"meanings\".\n\nI posted a quote the other day from Clara, explaining why the non-human unknown was better for sorcerers to explore.\n\nBecause you have no feelings about the things there.\n\nIt's one of the rare places such a comment is made in the books, that I know of.\n\nBecause it's a somewhat depressing thought for people who crave human attention.\n\nWhich points out a serious flaw in this subreddit.\n\nBut there isn't much we can do about it.\n\nPeople need \"ushers\" at first.\n\nSomeone to go along with them, into the non-human realms.\n\nNot so much for their success, but for their peace of mind.\n\nWe don't have anyone that powerful yet.\n\nCould be, it's those like Cholita who are crazy that could pull it off.\n\nI \"experimented\" on Cholita last night and handed her a pile of cash.\n\nA graduation gift in some ways.  She claimed I had kidnapped her for years, but then some outside older person told her how to test that theory, and she followed instructions a while back.\n\nDiscovering she wasn't being held hostage at all. And I was happy to help her move back to Mexico to live with a sister, wherever she liked.\n\nA well designed plan Cholita didn't come up with. Whoever the older person was, they knew that if she asked just to have me help her move back to Mexico, with no one to protect her, I'd say no.\n\nBut to move in with a sister, of course!\n\nThe goal is for her to get better, not escape somewhere.\n\nShe'll outlive me by 20 years or more, so she has to resolve her homelessness issue.\n\nI was worried the money I gave her last night was enough for her to get herself into big trouble for a few months. If she was still inclined to run away.\n\nI was pleased that she turned it down.  Took a $100 bill from the stack, after feeling how large it was.\n\nThen refused the rest saying she had to get a job and earn her own money.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kcsmqm4", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I surely don&amp;#39;t want to read anything he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That would be like reading Dexter&amp;#39;s diary...

And the good news is, Monroe&amp;#39;s assistant (likely more guilty than Monroe since he scammed the CIA too) is feeling the heat these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s got &amp;quot;interviews&amp;quot; on Youtube with him complaining about people criticizing him too harshly lately. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With what&amp;#39;s likely Monroe&amp;#39;s greedy daughter doing the interviewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Give men a chance to lie and pretend to have magical powers, and you&amp;#39;ll find plenty who will go along with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re actually just looking for a low cost endorsement for their own franchise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We get those too:  Endorsement shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tony Karim was an endorsement shopper.  Which is why we lost him to that obvious fraud the Dali Lama.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even real &amp;quot;Zen Masters&amp;quot; will tell you the Dali Lama is a total fraud! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen them do that to their monks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s ALWAYS a money making scheme behind any &amp;quot;spirituality&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos once asked us how the ENTIRE world could be so uniformly brainwashed???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thinking we&amp;#39;d see how impossible that is, without some outside force causing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With not a single human being escaping the blue line reality delusions.  Not even on an isolated island, practicing their 6000 year old Islander magic passed down from the Austronesians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, isolated humans in isolated cultures have their own scams for stealing money based on pretending magic. Even if they&amp;#39;re only scamming the village.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And foreign bad guys go looking for that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something exotic enough to give outsiders &amp;quot;hope&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they can import it and cash in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But all essentially the same thing.  And void of any significant magical content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A pyramid scheme of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you start navigating the dark sea and realize being human is only a tiny bit of the entire thing, and that human obsessions are the very things which prevent free exploration of all of it, you can understand why Carlos was mystified that EVERYONE is stuck at that position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But until you &amp;quot;see it with your own eyes&amp;quot;, meaning you&amp;#39;re gazing at an entire reality for which you can&amp;#39;t even find one single suitable word so that you could explain it to someone the next day, you realize how universally hooked we are on the blue line self-absorbed &amp;quot;meanings&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I posted a quote the other day from Clara, explaining why the non-human unknown was better for sorcerers to explore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you have no feelings about the things there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s one of the rare places such a comment is made in the books, that I know of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s a somewhat depressing thought for people who crave human attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which points out a serious flaw in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there isn&amp;#39;t much we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People need &amp;quot;ushers&amp;quot; at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone to go along with them, into the non-human realms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not so much for their success, but for their peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have anyone that powerful yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could be, it&amp;#39;s those like Cholita who are crazy that could pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &amp;quot;experimented&amp;quot; on Cholita last night and handed her a pile of cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A graduation gift in some ways.  She claimed I had kidnapped her for years, but then some outside older person told her how to test that theory, and she followed instructions a while back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Discovering she wasn&amp;#39;t being held hostage at all. And I was happy to help her move back to Mexico to live with a sister, wherever she liked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A well designed plan Cholita didn&amp;#39;t come up with. Whoever the older person was, they knew that if she asked just to have me help her move back to Mexico, with no one to protect her, I&amp;#39;d say no.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to move in with a sister, of course!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goal is for her to get better, not escape somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;ll outlive me by 20 years or more, so she has to resolve her homelessness issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was worried the money I gave her last night was enough for her to get herself into big trouble for a few months. If she was still inclined to run away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was pleased that she turned it down.  Took a $100 bill from the stack, after feeling how large it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then refused the rest saying she had to get a job and earn her own money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_18esz6l", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/18esz6l/paperweight_device_pamphlet/kcsmqm4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1702232854.0, "media_metadata": {"aig6khzoai5c1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 72, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/aig6khzoai5c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=385e2f5bf8b38fba6f4e6e12f51fdafc4e7e6d8f"}, {"y": 144, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/aig6khzoai5c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34ca289d33dc376024e906b49c214d548415fecd"}, {"y": 213, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/aig6khzoai5c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3ed4650224b05839143da7ab0fe7df40724ad8f"}, {"y": 426, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/aig6khzoai5c1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=accbc6265509fd47d89866bf467d7aceffb12edf"}, {"y": 640, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/aig6khzoai5c1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4b5b34fc1726fcb094a8480512bb1f31b29acbd"}, {"y": 720, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/aig6khzoai5c1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12de4f0f7280357dcc4ea6963559970bde144451"}], "s": {"y": 778, "x": 1167, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/aig6khzoai5c1.png?width=1167&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89922efdeab503b15a5f0d4ce511fb610d02124d"}, "id": "aig6khzoai5c1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1702232854.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 12}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kcs5d66", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "sleepy_boy_369", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kcs4797", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_df0e2vjg", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I believe he coined reality surfing I\u2019ve only heard it in relation to him", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_kcs5d66", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe he coined reality surfing I\u2019ve only heard it in relation to him&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_18esz6l", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/18esz6l/paperweight_device_pamphlet/kcs5d66/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1702226090.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1702226090.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "kcs4797", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1702225616.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_kcqwvrm", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I warned others about this very bad man.

For me, it&amp;#39;s a matter of terminology. I suppose one could say, in the parlance of this sub, that my assemblage point is at a different location than the one you&amp;#39;re ascribing to me. Indeed, it must be, given that I&amp;#39;ve personally witnessed the Rolling Force in action multiple times, starting before I was school age, and nevertheless survived: such a thing does not leave one unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose it is unfortunate, however, that you take issue with my choice of terms, because though we are both discussing a quality of perception which predates the language we&amp;#39;re communicating with, the liklihood of me independently encountering the sorcerer&amp;#39;s world appears to be unworthy of consideration. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, as you yourself alluded, convincing others of the veracity of our knowledge is not germane to the responsibility of possessing such knowledge, leaving me able to do naught but continue to pursue understanding in the manner such opportunities present themselves to me, and so I thank you for your invitation to join your path, but respectfully decline, as mine, it seems, leads a different way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wholeheartedly wish you well, for I am always glad to meet people of knowledge, whatever their stripe. May your journey be fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_t0imo6", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/t0imo6/communicating_with_rocks/hybjig3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1645751126.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1645751126.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hyb8r8l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hyanrnf", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "You just don't know enough about sorcery.\n\nYour pre-life memories are cyclic beings, who live right now.\n\nWe all have around 600 of them.\n\nYou can learn to switch over to them on demand, rather than wait for a meditation \"accident\".\n\nOnce you do, you realize the past life thing makes no sense at all.\n\nOn the other hand, no one who believes in those, ever acquires the sort of ability needed to leap through their solid wall, into a cyclic being copy.\n\nSo they never exhibit the knowledge they claim to have.\n\nI think it's just bad dreams, and they're involved in self-flattery.\n\nBut suit yourself!

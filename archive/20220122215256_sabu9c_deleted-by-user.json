This is not manifestation- it's just dreaming.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A properly bridged object is a real, three dimensional physical object where people in the base position of the assemblage point can see and experience it.

That's why it's a Bridge- a tool to help one connect between waking and dreaming reality.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-The first secret: Use your body! Your body can already bridge between worlds. So when you find a power object while Dreaming, grab it and hold onto it for dear life while returning your assemblage point to baseline! You need an active energy body for this so that grabbing the object in the second attention with your energy body actually translates into physically holding it as your assemblage point reverts back to blue baseline.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;KEEP HOLDING IT.

Give it \"relationships\"- personal history for objects!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-Second secret: to bridge an object with the waking world, it must be energy-generating. In other words it can't merely be a figment of your imagination or dreaming mind. It must have it's own sovereign energy and Intent holding it in existence. Theoretically you could manifest a non energy-generating figment of your own mind, but it would require TREMENDOUS personal energy, which most humans simply don't have.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So, what is the best and most available energy generating object we have at our disposal?

What I've found is that a large inorganic being of the 'higher order'- the ones that fiercely sizzle and crackle as Don Juan described in the Art of Dreaming- is enough energy to manifest approximately a piece of metal the size of a pinto bean.

But did you know they work?!](https://preview.redd.it/qcikh8xiozt41.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6c4e82de100cd9f85d3d49298de7eb6b8693741)\n\nPart 1:\n\nLast night, my little Fairy entity showed up.\n\nAnd I complained to her. How come she never talks?\n\nI explained to her, we could be such good friends if we could communicate!  She could scout for me, and bring back cool things. Or I would gladly do that for her.\n\nShe was just a head, perhaps a little shoulders, floating on a massive purple cloud of bright light, to my right.\n\nPreviously I had been using the tensegrity move to \"transfer dreaming energy\".\n\nIt seems to have worked.\n\nAfter complaining to her I felt a little worried, so I carefully watched her expression. She hasn\u2019t been herself since Cholita.\n\nHer mouth was open a little in a perfect circle,  but she wasn\u2019t angry.\n\nShe looked puzzled.\n\nShe seemed to be trying to understand what I wanted.\n\nShe  shrank to the size of a quarter and disappeared into the mist.\n\nI had my left hand cupped and pointed up because I had planned on scooping some of that massive purple light over there, to compress into a chi ball.\n\nWith her gone I turned back to look at my hand.\n\nShe was standing right on my left hand, in perfect form. I haven\u2019t seen her in 3D like that for a long time.  She turned around for me to show that she was fully solid.\n\nShe turned to her left, and I saw a bit of a dreaming scene behind her.  She leaned her head to emphasize to me, she wanted to show me that.\n\nI had a sudden shock. Why hadn\u2019t I thought of that!\n\nAnd I realized, she had her ways of teaching and it wasn\u2019t my place to complain.\n\nShe had just taught me to use a crystal ball, and she didn\u2019t need to talk in order to do that.\n\nBut of course, we all already know how to use a crystal ball.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t, just watch Wizard of Oz.\n\nFirst, you put on your gypsy outfit to set the mood.\n\nPlace the ball on a little stand on a small round table with chairs up close, so \u201ccustomers\u201d can see too.\n\nYou ask or think your question, gaze into the ball, and a dreaming scene materializes. The answer is in there.\n\nOr, you make up the answer, using what you\u2019ve figured out about the customer.\n\nI\u2019m afraid to say, as easy as it is to **really** learn to use a crystal ball, likely no one does it.\n\nFor men it requires absolute silence. You have to be able to materialize a dream inside the ball.\n\nWhile not all that difficult, it\u2019s impossible if you can\u2019t get silent.\n\nFor women, it requires lots of gazing. Pointless gazing that doesn\u2019t get them what they really want.\n\nThe men are inept, the women not interested.\n\nIf it weren't so, I suppose we'd all know that sorcery is real.\n\nIf women want to use a crystal ball, they\u2019ll just use their intuition to give their customers the answers most helpful to them. Not dreaming visions.\n\nOne dirty little secret of witches is, they become witches to save work. To make things easier.\n\nIt's pretty hard to convince them to practice sorcery.\n\nBut can you really get answers inside the crystal ball?\n\nSure.\n\nCarlos did it all the time.\n\nCheck out the cover of his Tensegrity book.\n\nIt\u2019s a hand, with a dreaming scene superimposed on it.\n\nRecent posts have mentioned what Carlos wrote about \u201cThe Wall\u201d.  Namely, you can project it onto any flat surface, even your hand.\n\nBut I'll tell you how to summon it.\n\nThe Wall is a flat representation of your second attention.\n\nYou can summon it with silence in darkness, first playing with colors, then look for fine lines, and see the lines on the wall.\n\nWatching the lines on the wall will pull your assemblage point to the right place.\n\nThe wall is for divination. You keep a question in mind, return to silence, and the answer will materialize on the wall.\n\nCarlos liked to read text.\n\nBut I prefer to view it as a desktop app, with lots of animations.\n\nThe animations are tiny dreams, which contain information relevant to your problem.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, an inorganic being comes along and sits on top of the wall, to supervise the animations.\n\nOf course, its main purpose is to be so amazing to see, that you don\u2019t interfere with the little animations which are going to combine to find your answer. It's hard to think of book deals with an inorganic being watching you.\n\nPeople tend to be a little paranoid of the inorganics.\n\nBut they aren\u2019t always in control. Sometimes, they\u2019re just there to help you keep your assemblage point where you need it to be.\n\n\"The wall\" isn\u2019t only for being in front of you. You can surround yourself with it.\n\nUsing this, you can transport your entire bed to another world.\n\nSometimes, you can even get off the bed and look around.\n\nBut Carlos\u2019 favorite use of the wall was to project it onto his hand.\n\nIn class, it often looked like he was reading crib notes.\n\nBut I could never see any actual writing.\n\nInstead, we know now, he was reading text from \u201cThe Wall\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to get the wall to form on my hand, but so far it hasn\u2019t worked.\n\nAnd so, with my little Fairy suggesting that I can confine dreaming scenes to my hand, I was quite anxious to test that out.\n\nThat\u2019s every bit as fun!\n\nI\u2019ve already learned, through absolute silence, to intercept dreams of people sleeping nearby. You simply gaze around the room, with the dreaming fog present, find a detail, and keep watching that.\n\nThe location of the detail in your room determines where that dreaming scene will materialize.\n\nIt\u2019s typically confined to a few feet in diameter, and so you can have more than one running at the same time.\n\nMy first idea was to scoop a dreaming scene into my hand, the same way you can scoop colors.\n\nI slowly turned my head left and right, looking for a sharp detail in the darkness.\n\nBut after the first sweep I noticed that an intense purple blob was sitting on my right hand.\n\nIt\u2019s a common sight.  Even people not interested in sorcery see it and write about it on the net.\n\nIt rotates very slowly, like a yin/yang symbol, with jet blackness eating up the intense purple as it spins, the purple continuously regenerating.\n\nBut here it was in my hand. I\u2019d never scooped up one of those before.\n\nThe one in my hand was a turbo variety. It had the purple, but it was being replaced by  yellow.\n\nIf there was any black, it was burning around the edges.\n\nUsually purple blobs of light in darkness are diffuse.\n\nBut the yin/yang variety are defined by the sharpness of their edges.\n\nI used to think that purple spinning \"whorl\" was simply a function of the eye, and how it constantly tries to balance the colors we are viewing.\n\nBut here it was on my hand.  I guess that idea is disproven.\n\nAnd even more unusual, it wasn\u2019t rotating. It was spinning, like the earth.\n\nIt was like a baseball on my hand, rotating counterclockwise.  I was watching the sides of it, as they passed by.\n\nI saw the face of my little fairy. She had a totally blank expression, as if it weren\u2019t really her. It was just a dream of her face.\n\nI watched as her nose rotated into view, with her pale white face and blank expression.\n\nI could see her ears rotate away, as the ball slowly spun.\n\nI watched that a few times.  I had a woman's head, spinning slowly on my hand. It was about 3 inches tall.\n\nI tried to get excited at the sheer spookiness, and how real it looked.\n\nBut I was silent.  I couldn't get worked up.\n\nThe back of her head seemed to have been taken over by the purple sworl, but her face looked normal.\n\nAfter a few turns I raised up my left hand, to try to do it without help.\n\nI lowered the right.\n\nI gazed into the center of it,  right at the depression in the upturned palm. I intended to materialize a dream there.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize, I shouldn\u2019t be able to see my palm in that darkness.\n\nA dreaming scene bubbled up like black oil oozing out of the ground.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t much. A woman was trying to sleep, tossing and turning.\n\nThat worried me. I got up and turned on the lights, to go check if Cholita had come home. I worry that she\u2019s sleeping on the cold streets.\n\nI got a better look at her notebook today, and she's gone far into crazy land.  Shopping cart crazy.\n\nI\u2019d been at it a few hours, so on not finding Cholita  I went back to bed.\n\nIn full-on heightened awareness sleeping is difficult.\n\nYou just  lay there in bliss.\n\nCarlos called it, \u201cRestful vigil\u201d, in Eagle\u2019s Gift.  Zuleica taught him.\n\nAfter a couple of hours in restful vigil, a dreaming scene forced itself into view.\n\nIt was so bright, I was startled.  I realized, I'd just been talking to Cholita and one of the witches, in half a dream state.\n\nBut I was fully alert now, and this vision was intense.\n\nMy little fairy was full sized.\n\nThe size of Cholita in fact.\n\nShe was standing behind the French door, connecting our bedrooms together, leading into the living room.\n\nShe was pounding on the windows frantically, her mouth trying to shout something.\n\nBut no sound could get through the glass door.\n\nI watched a bit more, trying to figure out if it was really Cholita in her dreaming body.\n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine how it could be my fairy.\n\nI turned my head to the right, and I was back in the dream with Cholita and her witch friend.\n\nMy little fairy started to make an even bigger fuss, insisting I had to watch her, not the dream.\n\nShe looked frustrated, as if she knew I hadn\u2019t heard her. I could feel that she had something very important to tell me.\n\nShe tried to scream it out, her mouth opening very wide.\n\nShe finally gave up and leaned her head and hands against the glass, as if all was lost.\n\nI knew it was just a vision but I was worried anyway.\n\nI got out my flashlight and searched the entire house and yard, to make sure Cholita wasn\u2019t in trouble.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited four times\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How to Use a Crystal Ball", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 104, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"qcikh8xiozt41": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 80, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qcikh8xiozt41.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3817359bb641dbfa26fc636ffa6d323d3a949196"}, {"y": 161, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qcikh8xiozt41.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a50ae9a0ae0ca02804e172245231959bc4a9369"}, {"y": 239, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qcikh8xiozt41.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d83bbd375a23717d21eed5db9c44d4dbac80b952"}], "s": {"y": 477, "x": 638, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/qcikh8xiozt41.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6c4e82de100cd9f85d3d49298de7eb6b8693741"}, "id": "qcikh8xiozt41"}}, "name": "t3_g4ul5q", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gheuYfx9T_GwYXV0eUVg7nEkFHX-lqK0O4lDlDaVNxc.jpg", "edited": 1587595275.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1587395630.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qcikh8xiozt41.png?width=638&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d6c4e82de100cd9f85d3d49298de7eb6b8693741\"&gt;We all know how to use these.

I realized, I&amp;#39;d just been talking to Cholita and one of the witches, in half a dream state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I was fully alert now, and this vision was intense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My little fairy was full sized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The size of Cholita in fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was standing behind the French door, connecting our bedrooms together, leading into the living room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was pounding on the windows frantically, her mouth trying to shout something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no sound could get through the glass door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched a bit more, trying to figure out if it was really Cholita in her dreaming body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t imagine how it could be my fairy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned my head to the right, and I was back in the dream with Cholita and her witch friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My little fairy started to make an even bigger fuss, insisting I had to watch her, not the dream.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked frustrated, as if she knew I hadn\u2019t heard her. I could feel that she had something very important to tell me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tried to scream it out, her mouth opening very wide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She finally gave up and leaned her head and hands against the glass, as if all was lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knew it was just a vision but I was worried anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got out my flashlight and searched the entire house and yard, to make sure Cholita wasn\u2019t in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited four times&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d442824c-6005-11ea-b1ec-0ebd57ae4429", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "g4ul5q", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 22, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/g4ul5q/how_to_use_a_crystal_ball/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/g4ul5q/how_to_use_a_crystal_ball/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1587395630.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fo7xluf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fo7pxnw", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I wonder if I can keep my \"magic crystal ball\" permanently?\n\nI kind of like how in Dr. Strange, everyone got magical \"artifacts\".\n\nI'd like one!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fo7xluf", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if I can keep my &amp;quot;magic crystal ball&amp;quot;

The purple fog was very thin.\n\nWhen I scooped, there wasn\u2019t anything in my hand.\n\nI tried to remove the traces of worry left by that phone call, and I started to see dreaming images.\n\nThey were related to that worry.  Memories.\n\nThey had replaced the normal purple fog.\n\nBut they were so faint, you could barely tell them from a daydream.\n\nOne after the other went by, looking very much like what can happen when you get very good at recapitulation.\n\nI had a realization.\n\nMaybe the goal of recapitulation isn\u2019t to fully remove things that bother you, but to teach you to work around them?\n\nJust let it be ok that they're still there.\n\nThat realization caused the dreaming scenes, swooping by one after the other, to slow down and halt.\n\nThinking about it now I suggest, the reason for recap is so that a memory in the mind doesn't trigger another one, due to an emotional reaction to some aspect of it.\n\nEach of those scenes had triggered the next, because of my reaction to some part of them.\n\nRecap makes it easier to let them be ok, so no more are triggered.\n\nWith the scenes gone, I could see the purple fog.\n\nA little head, the size of a quarter, popped out on the right.\n\nAnd then on the left too.  I couldn't figure out, was there more than 1 now?\n\nBut certainly, one was my Fairy entity.\n\nNow more of creepy ghost figure.\n\nShe\u2019d returned again.\n\nI said, out loud, \u201cOh, please show me!\u201d\n\nShe disappeared.\n\nI went to sit on pillows on the bed. I\u2019d been doing the Tensegrity on the floor.\n\nI gazed into my hand. I saw a black sphere in the middle. It was around the size of a golf ball.\n\nIt was dead black inside, but had yellowish grey on the outside, so that its shape could barely be seen to be a nearly perfect sphere.\n\nAs I watched it, it caught on fire!\n\nIt was like I had a cotton string ball, dipped in alcohol, burning on my hand.\n\nBut the flames were intense violet.   And in the middle of them, the ball had turned yellow and nearly opaque.\n\nI recognized it as the purple sworl, the yin/yang thing people commonly see.\n\nBut with the yellow replacing the purple, instead of the normal situation where blackness replaces it.\n\nIt was so captivating that I gazed deep into it.  I was finally getting fully silent, where images in the mind burn off by themselves, and Mr. DoubleTake is in awe and has nothing to say.\n\nIt looked like a lotus flower, such as you see in Buddhist tapestries. With something magical in the middle. That\u2019s also common Taoist iconography.\n\nBut the leaves were not perfectly spread like Buddhist images. Some bent over the ball a bit, so that they slightly encased it.  They left the right half viewable, as if they were some kind of holder for the ball.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t rotating like it does when seen floating around the room.\n\nIt was simply, burning.\n\nThe yellow ball started to rotate a tiny bit, inside the purple flame-petals, and I worried it was going to turn into La Gorda\u2019s eye.\n\nI hate that thing!\n\nAnd I'm not the only one who's been plagued with it, besides La Gorda.\n\nMaybe the thought that I didn\u2019t want an eyeball floating around me, changed the outcome.\n\nThe yellow ball stopped turning.\n\nI was feeling a little disappointed at that point.\n\nI wanted dreams in my hand, not a burning yellow ball.\n\nI gazed deeper into it, thinking I could see a dream inside,  and a tingle went up my body.\n\nThe bedspread transformed. I could see a world down there.  All over the bedspread, like I was watching it from 50 feet in the air.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t sharp enough to recognize much.\n\nIt was sort of like that scene at the end of \u201cGhost\u201d, where you can barely see heaven in the background, but it\u2019s all blurry.\n\nThe worlds on the bedspread kept changing, and I realized why it was happening.\n\nStaring at ANYTHING coming from the second attention, while silent, will move the assemblage point.  I was cycling through positions of the assemblage point, available around heightened awareness.\n\nCarlos had told us about that.  Move an inch to the left, and something changes. Move to the right, and it's another possibility.\n\nHere I had a portable, magic crystal ball in my hands!\n\nI don't know if that's because I posted this with that crystal ball scene picture from Wizard of Oz.\n\nCertainly, I had no idea at all like that in mind, when I started that night.\n\nI wanted dreaming scenes in my hand.  It never occurred to me that the purple sworl would be there instead.\n\nI lifted it up. My head had been bent down to look at my hand, which was resting near my crossed left leg.\n\nAs I lifted it up, so that I could be upright and see the worlds on the walls instead of the bedspread, I kept staring into my palm. I moved slowly, so that I wouldn't disturb that wonderful burning ball.\n\nI realized, that\u2019s a tensegrity move!\n\nIt was taught in Culver City.\n\nYou scoop energy from near the floor, and raise the palm up like a mirror, in front of your eyes.  At the end, you \"pour\" whatever was in your hand, over your head.\n\nYou move the head and the hands together, smoothly.  Carlos knew we needed to do that, at first.\n\nThat tricky Carlos!\n\nWhat else is hidden in the tensegrity moves?\n\nCan I get some help here?  We need to find out.\n\nAnd preserve ALL known Tensegrity moves!\n\nUpright now, but still sitting on pillows, I saw that the entire room was cycling through other worlds I could view.\n\nI lost some time.\n\nI\u2019m not sure where it went.\n\nI tried to open a portal, but can\u2019t recall anymore.\n\nI do remember realizing that the area to the right of me had become full of cobwebs I could feel. I could move my hand around in there continuously, feeling solid fibers.\n\nI did it a while, thinking why not move the assemblage point that way?\n\nBut more I don't recall.\n\nI should have used the thumbs up!\n\nI\u2019ve gotten lazy about that. These days, the closest I get to thumbs up, is feeling guilty for telling you guys to do it, and then not doing it myself.\n\nMy body gets so relaxed, even moving a finger would redeploy massive amounts of energy, and disturb what I'm trying to do.\n\nThe guilt of not doing it now becomes the marker, but it\u2019s a poor substitute.\n\nWhen I came back from wherever I\u2019d gone, my left hand was sitting on my left leg, still holding the magic crystal ball.\n\nBut it had turned dark again.\n\nIf you want to understand *intent*, ponder why I was seeing that the same way crystal balls were used in Wizard of Oz.\n\nYou stare inside, you see a vision. When it's over, it goes dark.  It has a holder around it, made of something ornamental.\n\nIf that wasn't a cheesy copy of stereotypical crystal balls, it was at least a flashier copy.\n\nBut without any thought of that in mind, before I started.\n\nAnd remember how important it is, not to pollute the *intent* you have, to learn sorcery.\n\nIf you want to join a new Armando Torres \"lineage\", be my guest.\n\nI never met the guy, and I was around Carlos very often in the weeks before he died.\n\nIf he was secretly sending Armando on a \"mission\", he didn't mention it to me when he had his \"I'm dying\", private talk with me.\n\nWhich sent me here.\n\nGo ahead and pollute your internal dialogue, if you can't tell real from phony.\n\nAnd pacify your desire to actually learn sorcery, instead of pretending.\n\nMaybe your new sorcery lineage could all wear fezzes?\n\nFezzes are cool.  I might even join that one.\n\nI'd be \"The Purple Fezz!!!!\"\n\nYay!\n\nBut don't say I didn't warn you about polluting *intent,* and pacifying your urgent need to practice.\n\nMyself, I'd avoid reading even a single word written by a me-too Nagual.  They were all the enemies of Carlos.\n\nI glanced around the room, hoping to find Cholita.\n\nTo my far upper right, a little dream materialized.\n\nTwo people were arguing.  Neither was Cholita, although I got a little rush of hope when I first saw it.\n\nI reached up with my right hand, to see if I could scoop it down and contain it in my palm.\n\nIt worked!\n\nI was gazing down at the arguing people, and the scene changed.\n\nIt was a \u201cmouse person\u201d, such as you\u2019d see in a cartoon. He was all white, and was lifting up a smaller copy of himself, tossing it over his shoulder like a baby.\n\nBoth had big round ears, like a preliminary, white naked version of Mickey Mouse.\n\nI took it to be a doll. He had a mouse person doll to play with.\n\nI noticed, the dream wouldn't stay perfectly in my hand. Whatever was needed in terms of space, to complete it, was taken up by the area around my hand.\n\nIt was no longer a small window into a dream, I was literally balancing a 3D dream on my hand.\n\nAnd it was portable! I could move my hand, and it remained above it.\n\nAnd the dream didn't mind floating up a few inches, so that the bottom details were more plain.  For an instant, I was worried it would drift away, like one of those good witch bubbles from the same Wizard of Oz movie.\n\nI watched the mouse-person for a while, got bored, and the dream changed.\n\nAnd then it changed again, and again, and again.\n\nAnd all are now lost.\n\nExcept. There was a lady deciding which type of 1950s hat to wear today.\n\nIt was time to get up and face the plague.\n\nEdited 6 times", "edited": 1587596245.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fo793t6", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2: Tensegrity Candy Land&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got an urgent phone call from a family member last night, trying to drag me into their endless suffering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My family is about as good as families get, several of them famous, but they\u2019re in hell all the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was worried that the left-over internal dialogue it produced (how to fix their issues) would prevent me from materializing dreams in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d done it the night before, and it would be really nice to finally discover something super cool and exciting which could be done on a repeated basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was doing tensegrity to try to overcome the internal dialogue, and it wasn\u2019t going well.

It interrupts the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the internal dialogue is interrupted, weird stuff happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People experience that, and then they buy into whatever delusional explanations the system has added on top of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why has your guru not realized that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s only in to the book deal.  He&amp;#39;s likely never been interested in the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;99.999% of &amp;quot;seekers&amp;quot; are just self-pity filled people looking for attention from other human beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your guru would not even believe my post about crystal balls. He&amp;#39;d call me &amp;quot;delusional&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try it and see!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had some hot discussions with &amp;quot;enlightened&amp;quot; people.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose they did achieve the realization that things are empty, and the whole world is built on concepts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they stop there, because that&amp;#39;s all they wanted. The certification.  The diploma.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check out this guy.  At least he&amp;#39;ll talk about it. But look how he makes fun of having a little fairy standing on his hand:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1714&amp;amp;v=xF5V9r7_ZHI&amp;amp;t=25m40s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1714&amp;amp;v=xF5V9r7_ZHI&amp;amp;t=25m40s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And check out this, to see why Tibetan Buddhism is awesome. They don&amp;#39;t avoid the cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, they&amp;#39;ve been saddled with false explanations, so Milarepa really believed he was visited by demons who were torturing people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Milarepa was visited by inorganic beings.  He made them into demons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And people being tortured was his issue.

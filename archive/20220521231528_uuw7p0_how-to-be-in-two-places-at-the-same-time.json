It took too long to make the picture.\n\nI'll come back tomorrow and explain what I can, but most had to go into the advanced subreddit.\n\nThat's the \"more accurate\" J curve there in the picture. The one Carlos explained.  The colors at the bottom are speculative, and don't agree completely with what advanced practitioners have found.\n\nThere should be some \"pink\" down there.\n\nIn the original J curve picture of the little man, Ijust let the purple region continue straight, when in fact that starts just above your navel and goes from the left side of your body to the right.  From your point of view, looking down at your stomach.\n\nIt's because Man's band of Awareness is slightly tilted in the overall luminous egg.  it's a \"slice of cheese\" 1 foot side, combined with 7 other slices to make our \"ball of cheese\".\n\nThere seems to be a neighboring \"cheese slice\" that's the \"black world\" which ages you horribly if you go in there, so sorcerers only use it as a portal to physically transport their entire body elsewhere in Man's cheese slice.\n\nIt's like a \"cheating passage way\" to deal with physical matter.\n\nBut you AGE in there.  Fast.\n\nMakes sense if it can manipulate solid matter too.\n\nWe're fuzzy on this topic, so don't believe much of what I just said about the \"black cheese\".\n\n\"The Nagual's Blow\" pushes your assemblage point through the middle of your body (cheese ball) and it lands approximately on that purple line.  If you read in the books about various levels of heightened awareness, that's what's going on.  The nagual's blow can land it more to the left, or more to the right.\n\nThe right is \"Crazy Town!\".\n\nThe most fun part of the city.\n\nWhere it lands on that purple part, determines how \"far out there\" you are.\n\nIt doesn't take much to end up in your double, and not realize it.\n\nAnd in that case your tonal can either shrink, so that you are entirely in your double with much of your tonal's rationality, or both can exist at the same time.\n\nIn this picture, Cholita helped me stabilize both at the same time and created \"reality ripples\" to help me move from one to the other.\n\nI had no idea she could do that.\n\nCholita does things carelessly,  including stupendous magic only a Jedi could do.\n\nAnd then won't talk about it...  Those witches did a number on her.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nNext day, Cholita showed up again.\n\nI've been missing her double many months now.  I can't recall the last time she showed up.\n\nI got the idea that maybe her double was mostly visible when the assemblage point was on the back, but once mine got to the front I couldn't perceive her.\n\nOr she couldn't \"find\" me.  If she came to my room and I wasn't visible to her (remember, she's in a dream herself), perhaps she just left.  And I didn't notice it.\n\nBut I'm out on the part of the J curve where \"the double becomes visible\", and maybe my double can find her even if my Tonal body can no longer see her.\n\nI've been doing the affection pass a lot, and each time the double does in fact become visible.\n\nWe don't know such details as when you can perceive a double and when not, but back when Cholita would visit me visibly, sometimes spectacularly as she demonstrated how she could fly like an angel, or brought me inorganic beings to try to scare me, I tried to lure her to go traveling with me into the second attention.\n\nAll I had to do was ignore her, instead of obviously wanting to follow her.  She was a bit like a pet teenage dog who likes to play chase. If she saw you were inclined, she'd take off running.\n\nIt's very hard at my age to keep up with a witch like Cholita who can ignore solid matter and run any direction she likes.\n\nI used to cheat if she ran too far out of my darkroom and head back to my bed to \"remote view her\".\n\nOn the bedspread.\n\nWhich was even more fun.  A few incidents are in past posts. I once tore a chunk out of a remote view of a mexican village Cholita was hiding in, and it was so solid I could set it on the bed next to me.\n\nAnd it remained.  Perhaps a whole half hour  as I new recall it. But it's in a post if you want more accuracy.\n\nKeep in mind, I do everything fully awake, eyes open, no drugs.  As Carlos taught us in private classes.  You didn't find \"meditation mannequins\" in his classes,  smiling peacefully hoping to suck up admiration attention from observers.\n\nSo even if it \"makes no sense\", it's still sorcery.  Something no other system has, despite their pretend claims.   I doubt the Buddha ever tore off even a tiny chunk of India, and set it on  his bed.\n\nIn fact, I doubt he could do anything at all with his eyes open.  Despite the manufactured tales of the monks over the centuries.\n\nHe was in the \"green river of slime\", instead of in the blue line river of shit like most people. So his \"tales of the green slime\" impressed gullible people who had absolutely no magic in their lives.\n\nHe took advantage.  Like a pimp with a teenage runaway.\n\nBeing \"slimed\" with a goofy Buddha grin on your face looking at closed eye visions, is not much to brag about.\n\nFortunately, it's not at all like Buddhists think when you're doing the real thing.  Myself, I couldn't stand to have to live in their delusional view of the world.\n\nBut back to how I lost Cholita months back.\n\nWhen I tried to get Cholita to follow me into the second attention like it was a path into a dark forest,  through the north wall of my bedroom, she couldn't get past some kind of \"barrier\".\n\nShe literally split into pieces with her double's head spinning in the air, and her body broken into \"parts\" on the bed.\n\nI concluded her double didn't have the \"mass\" to go where I was going.  Maybe you need the tonal body's extra awareness to do something.  And she was purely in her dreaming double.\n\nThose puffs of tonal awareness stuck in our internal organs (the energy pouches) can go along with the double.  He's the purple puffs, your tonal awareness tends to be yellowish.\n\nAt least, as far as I can perceive.  And some of it will \"go along\" with the purple puffs, under the right circumstances.  That's how you become lucid in dreaming and find your hands.  You brought some tonal awareness along.\n\nBottom line, Cholita stopped visiting me when she decided to \"move out\", and some mysterious person or people gave her a place to live.\n\nIn the end, they sent her back.  Humbled it seems.\n\nAnd she's been pretending not to be around since then.  Won't even use the bathroom.  And the shelves in the fridge were bare until a week ago.\n\nBut the last 2 nights she's back to visiting me.\n\nThe problem is, I'm in my double where I can perceive her.  I can't find her in my tonal body, gazing into the darkness.\n\nLast night she returned again, lured by the 6000 mile tunnel I'm working on.\n\nStuff from \"the other end\" was spilling into the room.\n\nFancy, my inorganic being, noticed I had used the Affection pass to bring out my double, and was enjoying  the sight of the moonlight at that shopping mall my double likes.\n\nShe tried to get me to physically enter the tunnel, insisting I wouldn't \"break it\" if I went in with my double.  And encouraged me to think of the moonlight the double could see, as \"tunnel support beams of blue light\".\n\nShe suggested, \"It's just a dream.   Your double is the master of those.   Go right in!\"\n\nI stuck the toes of my right foot in there, but as I was preparing to walk all the way in I detected Cholita in the room.\n\nI could feel her, like the night before.\n\nYesterday she was fully visible, but this time she was either \"just observing\", or she was continuing to hide from me the way her Tonal body is doing lately.\n\nShe made some suggestions I can't recall, and it seemed as if she were offering to take over.\n\nShe understands what I'm trying to do, because she knows what the goal is from back in private classes.\n\nI honestly can't recall what I said to her last night, but it was likely not a good thing to say.\n\nI don't have permission to send her to the other end of that tunnel.\n\nBut I probably told her to go ahead and do it herself if she knew how, and I seem to recall even pleading with her a bit...\n\nAnd pointing out all the fun magic stuff floating in the air like a pink mist of toys, in front of the entryway.\n\nBut stuff that happens in the double like that, even if it's mostly merged into the Tonal, is very difficult to remember in your normal assemblage point position.\n\nYou'd think, such cool magic would be impossible to forget!\n\nBut the problem is, at the time it seems perfectly normal and ordinary.\n\nSo if you went to the grocery store and saw an ordinary crow fly by, you would probably forget about it. It doesn't stand out as \"important\".\n\nSame for what happens at the far end of the J curve. It becomes \"natural\" over there, and there's no reason to remember it, like it was dramatic.\n\nI used to recommend the \"thumbs up\" to \"mark\" important things you experienced.\n\nBut even that doesn't work out in the deep orange zone.\n\nBottom line here:  **You'll** be doing this too, if you don't give up out of laziness. Or don't get distracted by pretend magic out there, promising to deliver you powers they never actually had.\n\nThe pretend kind is always a lot easier!\n\nOr as Carlos warned, **no one** has learned any sorcery so far, even all over Mexico where many claim to be sorcerers so they can cheat people out of money.\n\nNone were willing to \"change their lifestyle\".\n\nMeaning, none could find 3  hours a day to practice.\n\n3 lousy hours...\n\nYou know how you can tell that fat Miguel Ruiz, or Pudgy old Kachora are frauds?\n\nThey never emphasize hard work, describing what they had to do and how horrible it is to force silence, all alone, with no one to applaud you.\n\nBecause they never did any work at all.  And they only want your cash, so why worry you about having to actually do some work?\n\nIt's one way it's very obvious in this beginners subreddit, when a new poster is full of shit.\n\nThey just post their great sorcery skills, and no one has ever heard any complaints about how much darkroom can suck in the beginning.\n\nIt's like someone claiming to be an Olympic gymnast, but you never heard anything at all about all the hard work they did to get there.\n\nSuddenly they can simply do gold medal gymnastics.\n\nAnd like to explain to you \"the meaning\" of it.\n\nDon't let them trick you.\n\nDarkroom really sucks!!!\n\nIf they didn't complain at all, they never put in any actual work.\n\nAlso ignore when they claim to be, \"a misunderstood good guy\".\n\nThat just means they're the worst type of bad player of all.\n\nThe \"Comrade\".  Someone trolling for a \"franchise\" in here, because of the pictures.\n\nIf you could follow them in real life, you'd find them at the Taco Bell booth at the annual \"Franchise Convention\" in Vegas, trying to decide if they want to sell tacos for a living.\n\nBut that's a lot of work, so they try here first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How To Be In Two Places At The Same Time", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Cholita"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"w32ar580aw091": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w32ar580aw091.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f531ce681f38c300c548d1a3d26f2710aca85f84"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w32ar580aw091.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77840d4467e13b139bcd09b026445d7d98c07847"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w32ar580aw091.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5810149106dd868742feb65fa399405c9eeb041"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w32ar580aw091.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=012633c1f961abe151cc500abef35bc6aaf15340"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w32ar580aw091.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c4cfa87c71597d00b39300b1078980a2e464bdc"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w32ar580aw091.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93eea0988e5710a8635cc4c4296c837364fd68c3"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/w32ar580aw091.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7d467272092c4f9361a0fd1a2a9713abee6cb2e"}, "id": "w32ar580aw091"}}, "name": "t3_uuw7p0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 38, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Cholita", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 38, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jlQfquJGvvGjcOGSAV_PO7hlOlHEspHFmKetyvA42OU.jpg", "edited": 1653235159.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1653167728.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/w32ar580aw091.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e7d467272092c4f9361a0fd1a2a9713abee6cb2e\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s inevitable you will be in two places at the same time, if you don&amp;#39;t stop practicing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to go home and check on Cholita.

Go right in!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stuck the toes of my right foot in there, but as I was preparing to walk all the way in I detected Cholita in the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could feel her, like the night before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday she was fully visible, but this time she was either &amp;quot;just observing&amp;quot;, or she was continuing to hide from me the way her Tonal body is doing lately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She made some suggestions I can&amp;#39;t recall, and it seemed as if she were offering to take over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She understands what I&amp;#39;m trying to do, because she knows what the goal is from back in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly can&amp;#39;t recall what I said to her last night, but it was likely not a good thing to say.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have permission to send her to the other end of that tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I probably told her to go ahead and do it herself if she knew how, and I seem to recall even pleading with her a bit...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And pointing out all the fun magic stuff floating in the air like a pink mist of toys, in front of the entryway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But stuff that happens in the double like that, even if it&amp;#39;s mostly merged into the Tonal, is very difficult to remember in your normal assemblage point position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d think, such cool magic would be impossible to forget!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the problem is, at the time it seems perfectly normal and ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you went to the grocery store and saw an ordinary crow fly by, you would probably forget about it. It doesn&amp;#39;t stand out as &amp;quot;important&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same for what happens at the far end of the J curve. It becomes &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; over there, and there&amp;#39;s no reason to remember it, like it was dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to recommend the &amp;quot;thumbs up&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;mark&amp;quot; important things you experienced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But even that doesn&amp;#39;t work out in the deep orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line here:  &lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#39;ll&lt;/strong&gt; be doing this too, if you don&amp;#39;t give up out of laziness. Or don&amp;#39;t get distracted by pretend magic out there, promising to deliver you powers they never actually had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pretend kind is always a lot easier!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or as Carlos warned, &lt;strong&gt;no one&lt;/strong&gt; has learned any sorcery so far, even all over Mexico where many claim to be sorcerers so they can cheat people out of money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None were willing to &amp;quot;change their lifestyle&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meaning, none could find 3  hours a day to practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 lousy hours...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know how you can tell that fat Miguel Ruiz, or Pudgy old Kachora are frauds?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They never emphasize hard work, describing what they had to do and how horrible it is to force silence, all alone, with no one to applaud you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because they never did any work at all.  And they only want your cash, so why worry you about having to actually do some work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s one way it&amp;#39;s very obvious in this beginners subreddit, when a new poster is full of shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just post their great sorcery skills, and no one has ever heard any complaints about how much darkroom can suck in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like someone claiming to be an Olympic gymnast, but you never heard anything at all about all the hard work they did to get there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly they can simply do gold medal gymnastics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And like to explain to you &amp;quot;the meaning&amp;quot; of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let them trick you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darkroom really sucks!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they didn&amp;#39;t complain at all, they never put in any actual work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also ignore when they claim to be, &amp;quot;a misunderstood good guy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That just means they&amp;#39;re the worst type of bad player of all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Comrade&amp;quot;.  Someone trolling for a &amp;quot;franchise&amp;quot; in here, because of the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you could follow them in real life, you&amp;#39;d find them at the Taco Bell booth at the annual &amp;quot;Franchise Convention&amp;quot; in Vegas, trying to decide if they want to sell tacos for a living.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s a lot of work, so they try here first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "43d4e582-6010-11ea-a748-0ef2a7bb995d", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "uuw7p0", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 10, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/uuw7p0/how_to_be_in_two_places_at_the_same_time/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/uuw7p0/how_to_be_in_two_places_at_the_same_time/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1653167728.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_uuw7p0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_uuw7p0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i9t60e1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i9q9akd", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "Thank you, this is very good advice.

I was in sleep paralysis as I had fallen asleep on my back. Paralysis lasted minutes. IOBs appear above me while I can't move, struggle to move, or breathe. I'm in the bedroom but on the wrong side of the bed, my partner is sleeping on the other side and of course I'm trying to use what little movement I have to get my partner to wake me up. Doesn't work. I am too scared so I completely forgot to try and roll myself. At times I was also able to move but then would have restricted movement again. \n\nSo I tried to talk to these IOBs which were a kind of radiating, rippling black smoke. Some had \"faces\" of sorts which were made of solid black lines. Think of when you draw a smiley face on a piece of paper. But I was terrified of them, and still trying to keep my cool. \nI don't recall much of what was said. I couldn't hear them well\u00a0 but they did speak to me. I get the impression that they would visit me more, and that they might be sending me somewhere. I also remember they said I will meet God. \n\nI see light coming from inside me, then a person made of light takes my hand and I'm whisked in a dream. \n\nAnd I know it's a dream. But it's very solid. My sister is there but she tells me it is May 29th 2011. I tell her and others I need to get back to 2022, where I'm sleeping in my bed. I can't live out 11 years of time that has already passed me, I don't want to go back. \n\nThis goes on and on for what feels like hours (in reality, only am hour and a half passed since I went to bed). I'm going from different place to different place trying to get back. The dreams seemed to get weirder, especially towards the end. I meet lots of people who I know, but they are not the same, and I meet lots of new and strange people, all while maintaining that I need to go back because I don't want to lose what I have (partner, family). \n\nI forgot a lot of the details after the sleep paralysis and IOBs. But these felt like places, solid and real, and didn't have the usual transience of dreams. And no matter what I couldn't seem to find a way out. Until everything culminated in some extremely bizarre event where I think I lost \"lucidity\" or my aim of getting back.

I was in sleep paralysis as I had fallen asleep on my back. Paralysis lasted minutes. IOBs appear above me while I can&amp;#39;t move, struggle to move, or breathe. I&amp;#39;m in the bedroom but on the wrong side of the bed, my partner is sleeping on the other side and of course I&amp;#39;m trying to use what little movement I have to get my partner to wake me up. Doesn&amp;#39;t work. I am too scared so I completely forgot to try and roll myself. At times I was also able to move but then would have restricted movement again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I tried to talk to these IOBs which were a kind of radiating, rippling black smoke. Some had &amp;quot;faces&amp;quot; of sorts which were made of solid black lines. Think of when you draw a smiley face on a piece of paper. But I was terrified of them, and still trying to keep my cool. \nI don&amp;#39;t recall much of what was said. I couldn&amp;#39;t hear them well\u00a0 but they did speak to me. I get the impression that they would visit me more, and that they might be sending me somewhere. I also remember they said I will meet God. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see light coming from inside me, then a person made of light takes my hand and I&amp;#39;m whisked in a dream. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I know it&amp;#39;s a dream. But it&amp;#39;s very solid. My sister is there but she tells me it is May 29th 2011. I tell her and others I need to get back to 2022, where I&amp;#39;m sleeping in my bed. I can&amp;#39;t live out 11 years of time that has already passed me, I don&amp;#39;t want to go back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This goes on and on for what feels like hours (in reality, only am hour and a half passed since I went to bed). I&amp;#39;m going from different place to different place trying to get back. The dreams seemed to get weirder, especially towards the end. I meet lots of people who I know, but they are not the same, and I meet lots of new and strange people, all while maintaining that I need to go back because I don&amp;#39;t want to lose what I have (partner, family). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forgot a lot of the details after the sleep paralysis and IOBs. But these felt like places, solid and real, and didn&amp;#39;t have the usual transience of dreams. And no matter what I couldn&amp;#39;t seem to find a way out. Until everything culminated in some extremely bizarre event where I think I lost &amp;quot;lucidity&amp;quot; or my aim of getting back. Things went black? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I woke up breathless and bewildered and SO pleased to be back in reality with my partner sleeping next to me, on the correct side. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really know what to make of this.

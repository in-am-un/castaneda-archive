Real, unfailing intelligence from what I see is a function of connection and emotion and simply knowing what you want, and intending it automatically, it happens as easily as breathing and it looks as close to perfect expression as you can get being in a goofy human body.

In order to do that, we may or may not have to move through what specefically kicked us out of being willing to live with such power.

Thereby doing it freely, no \"finally I've done it!\" ego screams, existential fears, worries, \"who's watching me's\" etc etc. It's something that stops us and ditties the intent.

The only way not to is by doing all of this thinking and depressing and wondering about the self that&amp;#39;s unfortunately so easy to do. You don&amp;#39;t have to make it work. That&amp;#39;s another thing that gets us, because us looking at our minds wondering on and trying to fix it, isn&amp;#39;t using it, its judging it, thereby limiting it. Like a video game character constantly rearranging or reading their own skills, rather than having fun with and using them freely. The better we get at silence the more usefully it will move information enough for us to replace the deduction and judgemental reflection everyone is caught in, and using as the basis for their shitty experiences. This is supposed to be incredibly easy, and natural. The reason it isn&amp;#39;t, is because we&amp;#39;re literally wired to judge and control and make things harder. Real, unfailing intelligence from what I see is a function of connection and emotion and simply knowing what you want, and intending it automatically, it happens as easily as breathing and it looks as close to perfect expression as you can get being in a goofy human body. And most of the time we just want that incredible feeling of aliveness and potential, and to not lose that power going through daily life. In order to do that, we may or may not have to move through what specefically kicked us out of being willing to live with such power. To encounter the &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; that having that power creates, enough to be willing to us this power without being afraid or attaching something to it. Thereby doing it freely, no &amp;quot;finally I&amp;#39;ve done it!&amp;quot; ego screams, existential fears, worries, &amp;quot;who&amp;#39;s watching me&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; etc etc. It&amp;#39;s something that stops us and ditties the intent. The intent morphs into a desire for safety and comfort and ego things or whatever and out of free and infinite expression and connection.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_bv8dpj", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/bv8dpj/any_hint_on_flyers/j1nbd5b/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1672000878.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1672000878.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j1gje2e", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1671854985.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j1f0l4h", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "I totally agree.

Actually it was a few months ago that I stumbled back across Journey to Ixtlan while visiting my mother. So I wasn't all that surprised when I discovered this community.\n\nI'm  hoping maybe someone with a little more experience can provide some insight on an experience I had 5 or so years ago that, perhaps, has me feeling somewhat apprehensive as I have started practice again.\n\nas briefly as I can, I have never lost the ability to see energy, however my biggest struggle with silence and the like came from my 2 years brainwashing at the hand of \"western yogis\" I knew from the start that none of the self named yogananda deva pants were providing anyone with anything but themselves with a paycheck, amongst other things. I mean how is a meditation retreat where you pay someone to endlessly talk about silence a thing. Nevertheless, at some point I guess I lost confidence in myself though because I found I could no longer be silent myself all I heard was the endless chatter of a bunch of Deepok Chopras. Fortunately I fell down a rather steep hole walking in Costa Rica and injured myself right into a much longer battle with Opiods, another story.\n\nI had many experiences with beings as a child, some as an adult, but none quite so...whatever you want to call what happened this particular night in my mid twenties.\n\nI was sober..well, much more so than usual. Going to bed at a reasonable hour and years out of any intentional practice, when I heard a loud knocking at my garage door, my studio being above. The nature of the knocking led me to believe it was my state trooper neighbor. The dogs had heard it as well so I went down opened the door looked around called his namd,  noticed his car wasn't there, shrugged and went back upstairs. Then came what sounded like someone breaking the door down, followed by heavy footsteps and the sound of the sliding door opposite opening and closing loudly.\nAt this point the dogs were losing it, as was I.\nI armed myself took the dog for the job and went to confront whatever meth head had just broken into my house...except...\n\nWhen I opened the sliding glass door I felr a blast of cold air and I my spine went Ice man as I saw what I knew immediately to be 5 or 6 disembodied? persons, it was hard to say because one looked like two people who had been fused together under a semi. Having dealt with one little girl in a similar state, I guess, and feeling no hostility from any of them, I put down my weapon steppes through and politely asked if I could help them...my dog went to all of them sniffed them, but had lost any of the guard dog stuff we were doing, one even seemed to pet him, his eyes glowed golden for a moment and then he came and sat beside me. The little one upsrairs was still flipping out.\n\nHere is where things get interesting I felt something extremely hostile coming from behind me but right before impact  some dude dressed like a tree well camouflaged in my tree, grabbed me and moved me out of the way. I say grabbed, but it was more like he triggered me to make sure I made the move. \n\n\"Yeah close one, bud! She wanted to ghost you for sure\" he said almost laughingly. \n\"Real sorry about this but I don't have much time to explain\" he continued.\nI saw by we he meant the very small black person with his feat in my fish pond who appeared to be composong a rap song and some sort of luminous lady whom I could tell right away didn't think much of me and who I could never really get a good look at though I could hear her.\n\"So you are alive, we are...not...well not like you..\"\n\"This disagreeable..lady you just almost met doesn't know the difference and is having some trouble..adjusting..\" \nWha.. the  I don't \n\"Hmph I told you\" I heard the luminous lady \n\"now now he interrupted we usually don't do this sort of thing, but you were the only option given such short notice and her..acting out. so she's coming around when I count to 3 you turn  and focus everything you have at her, do not,no matter what you see break your attention or stare for even a milisecond..or\" 1...3!!!\n\nAgain he \"urged\" me to move I spun around to see I don't know what coming from my roof, a shrieking black woman cloud with huge teeth? I was so scared i don't think I could have looked away if he had told me to do that instead so I looked and focused all my energy at this thing\nThe three of them did as well, as did the other six although none of them ever spoke or moved..exactly.\n\nGradually she shrank and the hostility subsided, until eventually she looked like a normal woman and the little dude beckoned two children I hadn't seen before from behind the tree. She embraced them both then turned to the luminous woman and they walked through a new pathway that materialized and were gone.\n\nI don't think I peed myself but i might have. \nTree guy gave a whoop \"I knew you had it in you\"!\n\"what in the fuck just happened\"? I asked?\nthis time our rapper friend\n\"That there was what y'all might call a poltergeist ya know like a malevolent force\"? \n\"We all just call a bitch like that a shitty parent\"\n\"We do not\" interjected tree person \"we call her a maladjusted soul\" 'here we go'\n\"You see sometimes when someone has say thrown there two young children and themselves from a building in a fit of rage that rage goes with them annnd they act out, so we have to step in, but it always helps to have flesh and blood to help hem understand, particularly ones in a state such as hers and thats where you came in I told you, i told you he could do it\" \n\"and if he had not..\" I heard that condescending voice again\n\"well he did\"\n\"Hang on, are you guys saying your the Ghostbusters,  or the ...Would she have killed me\"?!?! \nI tried to sound incredulous and not like someone weak in the knees\n\"I don't  know\" he shrugged \"well we'll be off then\" \n\" Uhhhmmm what wait..will y'all aren't gonna do that again or anything are you?!?!\"\n\"I shouldn't think so, but then again I don't know\" \nHe winked, the rapstar gave me a peace sign they turned and disappeared.\n\nanyways I lucid dreamed everynight until sometime around then, well more probably in the depths of my addiction, and am just starting to again. I can deal with wormholes, energy, other inorganic beings I have encountered. That one takes the cake though and while I have told a few people, most of them suggested I get help. It took years and returning to some sort of practice to decide myself I hadn't suffered some sort of psychotic break, my practice recently has met with little more success than seeing energy, recently, what almost became a vision to somewhere else as I have seen described here, before I lost my silence.

Maybe if she'd strung you along, you'd still be visiting her once a year, hoping she'll actually teach you math. But if she did, she'd lose some income.\n\nThe same ought to happen with Zen masters, Daoist teachers, and Gurus.\n\nThey should put themselves out of business quickly.\n\n\\&gt; when I heard a loud knocking at my garage door,\n\nI was plagued with that constantly while in Carlos' classes.\n\nI got up to check, never was anything.  Finally I stopped checking, and the phone range.  But there was something wrong with the sound of the ring. It was like a perfect pre-recorded \"telephone ring\", from a sound effects keyboard.\n\nI think it's just the \"knock of the spirit\", that's all.\n\nBut of course, the IOBs help the spirit out a bit.  The Spirit probably doesn't act without a \"being\" in between.  But I suppose we don't know that detail.\n\n\\&gt; He winked, the rapstar gave me a peace sign they turned and disappeared.\n\nGo read the account of Vicente giving Carlos the plants, and the 3 men who showed up, broken down on the road.  Those were his allies, not real people.\n\nFor you, Knock on the door was IOB getting your attention. And apparently they pulled your assemblage point into dreaming.\n\nIn dreaming they can both speak, and seem to be absolutely real.\n\nI've ended up in copies of an apartment I used to live in, with an IOB in full realistic form.  I didn't realize I was in a dream, because everything seemed normal.\n\nCholita gave me a gift for a birthday, of a lovely old piece of a metal can, painted with a picture designed to help a sinner \"repent\".  They hang those outside the church, near an altar.\n\nIt showed what had driven him to the church. He was walking down the street, drunk, and ran into the devil himself.\n\nWhen Cholita moved in 20 years later, she took it back.  Or I'd get a pic of it.\n\nRun-ins with the IOBs in a waking dreaming state are not uncommon at all.\n\nYou didn't mention the kind of fright I'd expect if you realized what was going on, so it seems as if you lost a bit of lucidity.\n\nBecame \"drunk\" as Juan would call it.\n\nDon't obsess over the details.\n\nHow it started, and the long duration, are the most interesting features.\n\nYour other practices must have helped out with that.\n\nWith darkroom gazing, eventually you'll get used to \"beings\" showing up, fully visible.\n\nYou might even complain, \"Hey, you're late!\"\n\nBy the way, I'd pit a couple of people in here against the knowledge of Yogananda any day!\n\nAnd it's nearly a crime that would sound so outrageous at his left-over monastery.\n\nShame on the teachers there!\n\nShouldn't they look around and admit: This isn't working...\n\nNo. Because it's not working anywhere else.

But if she did, she&amp;#39;d lose some income.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same ought to happen with Zen masters, Daoist teachers, and Gurus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They should put themselves out of business quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; when I heard a loud knocking at my garage door,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was plagued with that constantly while in Carlos&amp;#39; classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up to check, never was anything.  Finally I stopped checking, and the phone range.  But there was something wrong with the sound of the ring. It was like a perfect pre-recorded &amp;quot;telephone ring&amp;quot;, from a sound effects keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s just the &amp;quot;knock of the spirit&amp;quot;, that&amp;#39;s all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But of course, the IOBs help the spirit out a bit.  The Spirit probably doesn&amp;#39;t act without a &amp;quot;being&amp;quot; in between.  But I suppose we don&amp;#39;t know that detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; He winked, the rapstar gave me a peace sign they turned and disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go read the account of Vicente giving Carlos the plants, and the 3 men who showed up, broken down on the road.  Those were his allies, not real people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For you, Knock on the door was IOB getting your attention. And apparently they pulled your assemblage point into dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In dreaming they can both speak, and seem to be absolutely real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve ended up in copies of an apartment I used to live in, with an IOB in full realistic form.  I didn&amp;#39;t realize I was in a dream, because everything seemed normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita gave me a gift for a birthday, of a lovely old piece of a metal can, painted with a picture designed to help a sinner &amp;quot;repent&amp;quot;.  They hang those outside the church, near an altar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It showed what had driven him to the church. He was walking down the street, drunk, and ran into the devil himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Cholita moved in 20 years later, she took it back.  Or I&amp;#39;d get a pic of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Run-ins with the IOBs in a waking dreaming state are not uncommon at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You didn&amp;#39;t mention the kind of fright I&amp;#39;d expect if you realized what was going on, so it seems as if you lost a bit of lucidity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Became &amp;quot;drunk&amp;quot; as Juan would call it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t obsess over the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How it started, and the long duration, are the most interesting features.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your other practices must have helped out with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With darkroom gazing, eventually you&amp;#39;ll get used to &amp;quot;beings&amp;quot; showing up, fully visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might even complain, &amp;quot;Hey, you&amp;#39;re late!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, I&amp;#39;d pit a couple of people in here against the knowledge of Yogananda any day!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s nearly a crime that would sound so outrageous at his left-over monastery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shame on the teachers there!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shouldn&amp;#39;t they look around and admit: This isn&amp;#39;t working...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No. Because it&amp;#39;s not working anywhere else.

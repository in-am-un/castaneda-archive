Anything you see, is &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy came up with that. I was seeing the puffs in full daylight before she taught me to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Like the fantasies, thoughts and mental masturbations. Those make the world solid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also &amp;quot;thick&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine asking SK a &amp;quot;syntactic command&amp;quot; question, like, &amp;quot;Is my butt too big?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t imagine how you&amp;#39;d understand the answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A human could answer, but it would not be a silent knowledge answer, it would be a social construct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An SK answer would have to go into the history of butt preferences, all over the world.  It might conclude that in India, your butt is almost never too big.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;We cultivate enough dark energy and then keep moving, with perfect silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yea, I&amp;#39;ve been doing that lately.  I used to avoid it, because others don&amp;#39;t have a source, and I didn&amp;#39;t want an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s so hard to get to SK, I just can&amp;#39;t afford not to store up dark energy, by playing with my IOBs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy will ALWAYS come, if I do her pass more than 4 times. The one she designed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is sheer genius.  Every month I realize more of what she did in that pass.  What she hid in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of these days, I&amp;#39;ll write up how to design tensegrity passes of your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A well designed pass might summon an ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you never make them up, you only grab pieces from others, and string them together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chosen based on the effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;So the whole path was a whole process of improving the Seeing, and switching to the double&amp;#39; view of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone cover your eyes and don&amp;#39;t read this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you suppose there&amp;#39;s a 4th breath change which is pretty much a sign you are fully asleep, and using the double to keep practicing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean the orange zone breath change.  That&amp;#39;s just a change from being a total idiot, to being fairly silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, the one from mostly awake, to fully sleep walking.  Maybe even snoring while you walk around doing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you don&amp;#39;t notice the snoring, the same as you don&amp;#39;t when asleep laying down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not say that&amp;#39;s true.

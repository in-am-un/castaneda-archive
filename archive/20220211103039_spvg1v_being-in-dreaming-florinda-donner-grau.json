Within moments, however, I was assailed (attacked) by doubts. \"If 'knowledge' is but a male** **construct (concept, formation), then why your insistence, that I go to school (in university),\" I asked.250-251\"Because you are a witch, and as such, you need to know, what impinges (strike, encroach) on you and how it impinges on you,\" she replied: \"Before you refuse something, you must understand, why you refuse it. You see, the problem is, that 'knowledge', in our day, is derived purely from reasoning things out. But Women have a different track, never, ever taken into consideration. That track can contribute to Knowledge, but it would have to be a contribution, that has nothing to do with reasoning things out...What Sorcerers propose,\" she explained, \"is that, men can't have the exclusive right to reason. Men seem to have it now, simply because the ground, where men apply reason, is a ground, where maleness prevails. Let us, then, apply reason to a ground, where Femaleness prevails; and that ground is, naturally, the inverted cone (like a funnel), I described to you. Women's connection with the Spirit itself** **(Spirit means the Source of All Suns! LM)...That connection has to be faced with a different aspect of reasoning. An aspect never, ever used before: the Feminine side of reasoning,\" she said.\"What is the Feminine side of reason, Esperanza?\"\"Many things. One of them is definitely Dreaming...I know, what you expect from Sorcerers. You want rituals, incantations, odd, mysterious cults. You want to sing. You want to be 'One with Nature'. You want to commune with water spirits. You want paganism. Some romantic view of what Sorcerers do. Very Germanic.To jump into the Unknown, you need guts and mind.\u00a0Only with them will you be able to explain to yourself and to others the treasures, you might find... You need to act on your MAGICAL SIDE,\" she said.\"And what is that?\"\"THE WOMB... THE WOMB !\" Esperanza repeated. \"THE WOMB is the Ultimate Feminine Organ. It is THE WOMB, that gives Women that extra edge; that extra force to channel their Energy.\" She explained, that men, in their quest for supremacy, have succeeded in reducing Woman's Mysterious Power, HER WOMB, to a strictly biological organ, whose only function is to reproduce; \"to carry man's seed\"...P. 45-50\u00a0:\"She** **said, that millennia ago, Men and Women were the possessors of a Knowledge, that** **allowed them to slip in and out of our normal World. And thus they divided their lives into two areas: the day and the night. During the day they conducted their activities like everyone else. They engaged in normal, expected, everyday behavior. During the night, however, they became Dreamers. They systematically Dreamed Dreams, that broke the boundaries of, what we consider to be reality. Again she paused, as though giving me time to let her words sink in. \"Using the Darkness, as a cloak (cover), they accomplished an inconceivable thing. They were able to Dream, while they were Awake.\"** **Esperanza explained, that to be Dreaming, while they were Awake meant, that they could immerse themselves in a Dream, that gave them the Energy, necessary to perform feats, that stagger (overwhelm) the mind, while they were perfectly conscious and awake...She said, that the origins of the Sorcerers' Knowledge could be understood only in terms of a legend. A superior Being commiserating (express sorrow, sympathise) with the terrible plight (situation, dilemma) of human - to be driven, as an animal, by food and reproduction - gave human the Power to Dream and taught him how to use his Dreams. \"Legends, of course, tell the truth in a concealed fashion,\" she elucidated: \"The legends' success in concealing the truth rests on human's conviction, that they are simply stories. Legends of human, changing into birds or angels, are accounts of a concealed truth, which appears to be the fantasizing, or simply the delusions (deception, mistaken belief/idea) of primitive or deranged (disturbed) minds. So it's been the task of Sorcerers for thousands of years to make new legends, and to discover the concealed truth of old ones. This is where Dreamers come into the picture.** **Women are best at Dreaming. They have the facility to abandon themselves; the facility to let go. The Woman, who taught me to Dream, could maintain two hundred Dreams.\"** **Esperanza regarded me intently, as if she were appraising my reaction, which was complete stupefaction (great astonishment), for I had no idea, what she meant.** **She explained, that to maintain a Dream meant, that one could Dream something specific** **about oneself and could enter into that Dream at will. Her teacher, she said, could enter at will into two hundred specific Dreams about herself.** **\"Women are peerless (unmatched, unequal) Dreamers,\" Esperanza assured me: \"Women are extremely practical. In order to sustain a Dream, one must be practical, because the Dream must pertain (relate) to practical aspects of oneself. My teacher's favorite Dream was to Dream of herself, as a hawk. Another was to Dream of herself as an owl. So, depending on the time of the day, she could Dream about being either one, and since she was Dreaming, while she was awake, she was really and absolutely a hawk or an owl.\"There was such sincerity and conviction in her tone and in her eyes, I was entirely under** **her spell.** **Not for a moment did I doubt her.** **Nothing, she could have said, would have seemed outlandish (bizarre, absurd) to me at that moment.** **She further explained,\u00a0that** **in order to accomplish a Dream of that nature, Women need to** **have an iron discipline.** **She leaned toward me and in a confidential whisper, as though she didn't want the others** **to overhear her, said,** **\"By iron discipline** **I don't mean any kind of strenuous routine, but** **rather, that Women have to break the routine of what is expected of them.** **And they have to do it in their youth. And most important, with their strength intact. Often, when Women are old enough to be done with the business of being Women, they decide it's time to concern themselves with nonworldly or other-worldly thoughts and activities.** **Little do they know or want to believe, that hardly ever do such Women succeed.\"She** **gently slapped my stomach, as if she were playing on a drum.** **The secret of a Woman's strength is her WOMB.\"** **Esperanza nodded emphatically, as if she had actually heard the silly question, that popped into my mind: \"Her womb?\"\"Women,\" she continued, \"must begin by burning their Matrix. They cannot be the fertile ground, that has to be seeded by men, following the command of 'God himself'.\" Still watching me closely, she smiled and asked, \"Are you religious by any chance?\" I shook my head (No). I couldn't speak. My throat was so constricted,I could scarcely breathe. I was dumbstruck (unable to speak through shock/surprise) with fear and amazement, not so much by, what she was saying, but by her change. If asked, I wouldn't have been able to tell, when she changed, but all of a sudden her face was young and radiant. Inner life seemed to have been fired up in her. \"That's good!\" Esperanza exclaimed. \"This way you don't have to struggle against beliefs,\" she pointed out. \"They are very hard to overcome. I was reared a devout Catholic. I nearly died, when I had to examine my attitude toward religion.\" She sighed. Her voice, turning wistful, became soft, as she added, \"But that was nothing, compared to the battle I had to wage (engage in, carry on), before I became a bona fide (real) Dreamer.\" I waited expectantly, hardly breathing, while a quite pleasurable sensation spread like a** **mild electrical current through my entire body...Esperanza\u00a0revealed, that she had to battle** **herself.** **\"In order to be a Dreamer, I had to vanquish (defeat, subjugate) the Self,\" Esperanza explained. \"Nothing, but** **nothing, is as hard, as that.** **We, Women are the most wretched (miserable, mean, despicable) prisoners of the Self. The Self is our Cage.** **Our Cage is made out of commands and expectations, poured on us from the moment we** **are born.** **You know how it is. If the first born child is a boy, there is a celebration. If it's a girl,** **there is a shrug of the shoulders and the statement, 'It's all right. I still will love her and** **do anything for her.\"**\n\n**Out of respect for the old Woman, I didn't laugh out loud. Never in my life had I heard statements of that sort. I considered myself an independent woman, but obviously, in light of what Esperanza was saying, I was no better off, than any other woman. And contrary to the manner, in which I would have normally reacted to such an idea, I agreed with her. I had always been made aware, that the precondition (prerequisite, condition, train, accustom in advance) of my being a woman, was to be dependent. I was taught, that a Woman was indeed fortunate, if she could be desirable, so men would do things for her. I was told, that it was demeaning (degrading) to my womanhood to endeavor (conscientious effort) to do anything myself, if that thing could be given to me. It was drilled into me, that a woman's place is in the home with her husband and her children.\"Like you, I was reared by an authoritarian, yet lenient (gentle, forgiving, understanding, merciful, liberal, generous) father,\" Esperanza went on. \"I thought, like yourself, that I was free. For me to understand the Sorcerers' Way, that Freedom didn't mean to be myself, nearly killed me. To be myself was to assert (express positevely, affirm) my womanhood. And to do that, took all my time, effort, and Energy. The Sorcerers, on the contrary, understand Freedom, as the capacity to do the Impossible, the Unexpected - to Dream a Dream, that has no basis, no reality in Everyday Life.\" Her voice again became but a whisper, as she added, \"The Knowledge of Sorcerers is, what is exciting and new. A Woman needs to change the Self, become a Dreamer.\"Esperanza said, that if she had not succeeded in vanquishing (defeating, subjugating) the Self, she would have only led a Woman's normal life; the life her parents had designed for her. A life of defeat and humiliation.** **A\u00a0life devoid (completely lacking, empty) of all mystery. A life, that had been programmed by custom and tradition.\"\"The secret of a Woman's strength is in her Womb,\" Esperanza said and slapped my stomach once more. She said, that Women Dream with their Wombs, or rather, from their Wombs. The fact, that they have Wombs, makes them perfect Dreamers.\"\u00a0Before I had even finished the thought \"why is the womb so important?\"** **Esperanza answered me.** **\"The Womb is the Center of Our Creative Energy,\" she explained, \"to the point that, if there would be no more males in the World, Women could continue to reproduce. And the World would then be populated by the Female of the Human species only.\" She added, that Women reproducing unilaterally (one sided, one parent without a man) could only reproduce clones of themselves...\"**\n\n**(It means, that women can give birth without men only to female-babies. But to give birth to male-babies, women need a man. In this case energy for a baby-male is taken from both parents: a man and a woman and his Point of Perception (Assemblage Point) will face the INSIDE of his Luminous Ball. This way the approach to Higher Knowledge of the Universe and the ability to scan Universe are cut off. In the case of baby-female, her Point of Perception faces OUTSIDE of her Luminous Ball, which gives her ability to scan enormous spaces of the Universe and capability to get Higher Knowledge of the Universe from the Source of All Suns through her WOMB! Though to make a baby-male is even possible without a male at all, just by moving the Perception Point (Assemblage Point) in Human Luminous Ball to a certain position. This way Women-Sorceresses of Don Juan's the Line of Sorcerers from Mexico were changing to males, when it was necessary for them, and demonstrated this ability to their apprentices. That ability was described by Women-Sorceresses, authors Florinda Donner-Grau and Taisha Abelar in their books. These books are on our site in full electronic form.\u00a0LM.)**\n\n**\"Women, having then the** **ability and the organs for reproducing life, have also the ability to produce Dreams with** **those same organs,\"** **she said. Seeing the doubt in my eyes, she warned me,** **\"Don't trouble yourself wondering how it is** **done. The explanation is very simple, and because it's simple, it's the most difficult thing to understand. I still have trouble myself.** **So in a true Woman's fashion, I act: I Dream and leave the explanations to Men.\"** **Esperanza claimed, that, originally, the Sorcerers, she had told me about, used to pass their Knowledge on to their biological descendants or to people of their private choice, but the results had been catastrophic.\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://forceofintent.info/BeinginDreaming.html](https://forceofintent.info/BeinginDreaming.html)\n\nI researched Heightened Awareness and stumbled upon this Site from a Russian who really worked with the texts and even highlights the most important parts in red.

An aspect never, ever used before: the Feminine side of reasoning,&amp;quot; she said.&amp;quot;What is the Feminine side of reason, Esperanza?&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Many things. One of them is definitely Dreaming...I know, what you expect from Sorcerers. You want rituals, incantations, odd, mysterious cults. You want to sing. You want to be &amp;#39;One with Nature&amp;#39;. You want to commune with water spirits. You want paganism. Some romantic view of what Sorcerers do. Very Germanic.To jump into the Unknown, you need guts and mind.\u00a0Only with them will you be able to explain to yourself and to others the treasures, you might find... You need to act on your MAGICAL SIDE,&amp;quot; she said.&amp;quot;And what is that?&amp;quot;&amp;quot;THE WOMB... THE WOMB !&amp;quot; Esperanza repeated. &amp;quot;THE WOMB is the Ultimate Feminine Organ. It is THE WOMB, that gives Women that extra edge; that extra force to channel their Energy.&amp;quot; She explained, that men, in their quest for supremacy, have succeeded in reducing Woman&amp;#39;s Mysterious Power, HER WOMB, to a strictly biological organ, whose only function is to reproduce; &amp;quot;to carry man&amp;#39;s seed&amp;quot;...P. 45-50\u00a0:&amp;quot;She&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;said, that millennia ago, Men and Women were the possessors of a Knowledge, that&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;allowed them to slip in and out of our normal World. And thus they divided their lives into two areas: the day and the night. During the day they conducted their activities like everyone else. They engaged in normal, expected, everyday behavior. During the night, however, they became Dreamers. They systematically Dreamed Dreams, that broke the boundaries of, what we consider to be reality. Again she paused, as though giving me time to let her words sink in. &amp;quot;Using the Darkness, as a cloak (cover), they accomplished an inconceivable thing. They were able to Dream, while they were Awake.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Esperanza explained, that to be Dreaming, while they were Awake meant, that they could immerse themselves in a Dream, that gave them the Energy, necessary to perform feats, that stagger (overwhelm) the mind, while they were perfectly conscious and awake...She said, that the origins of the Sorcerers&amp;#39; Knowledge could be understood only in terms of a legend. A superior Being commiserating (express sorrow, sympathise) with the terrible plight (situation, dilemma) of human - to be driven, as an animal, by food and reproduction - gave human the Power to Dream and taught him how to use his Dreams. &amp;quot;Legends, of course, tell the truth in a concealed fashion,&amp;quot; she elucidated: &amp;quot;The legends&amp;#39; success in concealing the truth rests on human&amp;#39;s conviction, that they are simply stories. Legends of human, changing into birds or angels, are accounts of a concealed truth, which appears to be the fantasizing, or simply the delusions (deception, mistaken belief/idea) of primitive or deranged (disturbed) minds. So it&amp;#39;s been the task of Sorcerers for thousands of years to make new legends, and to discover the concealed truth of old ones. This is where Dreamers come into the picture.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Women are best at Dreaming. They have the facility to abandon themselves; the facility to let go. The Woman, who taught me to Dream, could maintain two hundred Dreams.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Esperanza regarded me intently, as if she were appraising my reaction, which was complete stupefaction (great astonishment), for I had no idea, what she meant.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;She explained, that to maintain a Dream meant, that one could Dream something specific&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;about oneself and could enter into that Dream at will. Her teacher, she said, could enter at will into two hundred specific Dreams about herself.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Women are peerless (unmatched, unequal) Dreamers,&amp;quot; Esperanza assured me: &amp;quot;Women are extremely practical. In order to sustain a Dream, one must be practical, because the Dream must pertain (relate) to practical aspects of oneself. My teacher&amp;#39;s favorite Dream was to Dream of herself, as a hawk. Another was to Dream of herself as an owl. So, depending on the time of the day, she could Dream about being either one, and since she was Dreaming, while she was awake, she was really and absolutely a hawk or an owl.&amp;quot;There was such sincerity and conviction in her tone and in her eyes, I was entirely under&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;her spell.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Not for a moment did I doubt her.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Nothing, she could have said, would have seemed outlandish (bizarre, absurd) to me at that moment.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;She further explained,\u00a0that&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;in order to accomplish a Dream of that nature, Women need to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;have an iron discipline.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;She leaned toward me and in a confidential whisper, as though she didn&amp;#39;t want the others&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to overhear her, said,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;By iron discipline&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean any kind of strenuous routine, but&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;rather, that Women have to break the routine of what is expected of them.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And they have to do it in their youth. And most important, with their strength intact. Often, when Women are old enough to be done with the business of being Women, they decide it&amp;#39;s time to concern themselves with nonworldly or other-worldly thoughts and activities.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Little do they know or want to believe, that hardly ever do such Women succeed.&amp;quot;She&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;gently slapped my stomach, as if she were playing on a drum.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The secret of a Woman&amp;#39;s strength is her WOMB.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Esperanza nodded emphatically, as if she had actually heard the silly question, that popped into my mind: &amp;quot;Her womb?&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Women,&amp;quot; she continued, &amp;quot;must begin by burning their Matrix. They cannot be the fertile ground, that has to be seeded by men, following the command of &amp;#39;God himself&amp;#39;.&amp;quot; Still watching me closely, she smiled and asked, &amp;quot;Are you religious by any chance?&amp;quot; I shook my head (No). I couldn&amp;#39;t speak. My throat was so constricted,I could scarcely breathe. I was dumbstruck (unable to speak through shock/surprise) with fear and amazement, not so much by, what she was saying, but by her change. If asked, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have been able to tell, when she changed, but all of a sudden her face was young and radiant. Inner life seemed to have been fired up in her. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s good!&amp;quot; Esperanza exclaimed. &amp;quot;This way you don&amp;#39;t have to struggle against beliefs,&amp;quot; she pointed out. &amp;quot;They are very hard to overcome. I was reared a devout Catholic. I nearly died, when I had to examine my attitude toward religion.&amp;quot; She sighed. Her voice, turning wistful, became soft, as she added, &amp;quot;But that was nothing, compared to the battle I had to wage (engage in, carry on), before I became a bona fide (real) Dreamer.&amp;quot; I waited expectantly, hardly breathing, while a quite pleasurable sensation spread like a&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;mild electrical current through my entire body...Esperanza\u00a0revealed, that she had to battle&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;herself.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;In order to be a Dreamer, I had to vanquish (defeat, subjugate) the Self,&amp;quot; Esperanza explained. &amp;quot;Nothing, but&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;nothing, is as hard, as that.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We, Women are the most wretched (miserable, mean, despicable) prisoners of the Self. The Self is our Cage.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Our Cage is made out of commands and expectations, poured on us from the moment we&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;are born.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You know how it is. If the first born child is a boy, there is a celebration. If it&amp;#39;s a girl,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;there is a shrug of the shoulders and the statement, &amp;#39;It&amp;#39;s all right. I still will love her and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;do anything for her.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out of respect for the old Woman, I didn&amp;#39;t laugh out loud. Never in my life had I heard statements of that sort. I considered myself an independent woman, but obviously, in light of what Esperanza was saying, I was no better off, than any other woman. And contrary to the manner, in which I would have normally reacted to such an idea, I agreed with her. I had always been made aware, that the precondition (prerequisite, condition, train, accustom in advance) of my being a woman, was to be dependent. I was taught, that a Woman was indeed fortunate, if she could be desirable, so men would do things for her. I was told, that it was demeaning (degrading) to my womanhood to endeavor (conscientious effort) to do anything myself, if that thing could be given to me. It was drilled into me, that a woman&amp;#39;s place is in the home with her husband and her children.&amp;quot;Like you, I was reared by an authoritarian, yet lenient (gentle, forgiving, understanding, merciful, liberal, generous) father,&amp;quot; Esperanza went on. &amp;quot;I thought, like yourself, that I was free. For me to understand the Sorcerers&amp;#39; Way, that Freedom didn&amp;#39;t mean to be myself, nearly killed me. To be myself was to assert (express positevely, affirm) my womanhood. And to do that, took all my time, effort, and Energy. The Sorcerers, on the contrary, understand Freedom, as the capacity to do the Impossible, the Unexpected - to Dream a Dream, that has no basis, no reality in Everyday Life.&amp;quot; Her voice again became but a whisper, as she added, &amp;quot;The Knowledge of Sorcerers is, what is exciting and new. A Woman needs to change the Self, become a Dreamer.&amp;quot;Esperanza said, that if she had not succeeded in vanquishing (defeating, subjugating) the Self, she would have only led a Woman&amp;#39;s normal life; the life her parents had designed for her. A life of defeat and humiliation.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A\u00a0life devoid (completely lacking, empty) of all mystery. A life, that had been programmed by custom and tradition.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;The secret of a Woman&amp;#39;s strength is in her Womb,&amp;quot; Esperanza said and slapped my stomach once more. She said, that Women Dream with their Wombs, or rather, from their Wombs. The fact, that they have Wombs, makes them perfect Dreamers.&amp;quot;\u00a0Before I had even finished the thought &amp;quot;why is the womb so important?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Esperanza answered me.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The Womb is the Center of Our Creative Energy,&amp;quot; she explained, &amp;quot;to the point that, if there would be no more males in the World, Women could continue to reproduce. And the World would then be populated by the Female of the Human species only.&amp;quot; She added, that Women reproducing unilaterally (one sided, one parent without a man) could only reproduce clones of themselves...&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(It means, that women can give birth without men only to female-babies. But to give birth to male-babies, women need a man. In this case energy for a baby-male is taken from both parents: a man and a woman and his Point of Perception (Assemblage Point) will face the INSIDE of his Luminous Ball. This way the approach to Higher Knowledge of the Universe and the ability to scan Universe are cut off. In the case of baby-female, her Point of Perception faces OUTSIDE of her Luminous Ball, which gives her ability to scan enormous spaces of the Universe and capability to get Higher Knowledge of the Universe from the Source of All Suns through her WOMB! Though to make a baby-male is even possible without a male at all, just by moving the Perception Point (Assemblage Point) in Human Luminous Ball to a certain position. This way Women-Sorceresses of Don Juan&amp;#39;s the Line of Sorcerers from Mexico were changing to males, when it was necessary for them, and demonstrated this ability to their apprentices. That ability was described by Women-Sorceresses, authors Florinda Donner-Grau and Taisha Abelar in their books. These books are on our site in full electronic form.\u00a0LM.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Women, having then the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ability and the organs for reproducing life, have also the ability to produce Dreams with&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;those same organs,&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;she said. Seeing the doubt in my eyes, she warned me,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t trouble yourself wondering how it is&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;done. The explanation is very simple, and because it&amp;#39;s simple, it&amp;#39;s the most difficult thing to understand. I still have trouble myself.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;So in a true Woman&amp;#39;s fashion, I act: I Dream and leave the explanations to Men.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Esperanza claimed, that, originally, the Sorcerers, she had told me about, used to pass their Knowledge on to their biological descendants or to people of their private choice, but the results had been catastrophic.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"https://forceofintent.info/BeinginDreaming.html\"&gt;https://forceofintent.info/BeinginDreaming.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I researched Heightened Awareness and stumbled upon this Site from a Russian who really worked with the texts and even highlights the most important parts in red.

Wish I could remember who, so they got credit.\n\n\"Mystery\" tends to give out that sort of historical information, but I can't say it was in fact her.  I do remember however, it was just about the time she became annoyed I still referred to her as male.  Or to be more precise, she didn't like being \"dismissed\" as unimportant.\n\nBasically before agriculture, mankind hunted and gathered the food they needed.\n\nSometimes that was hard, but the Luiseno here in my area, 10,000 years ago, only had to work 3 days a week because they became so good at food gathering.\n\nLikely acorns and fish was their easiest food supply,  but there were also lots of prey to hunt.  Jackrabbits were the abundant, especially once they learned to flood grasslands and make them grow lush.\n\nHorticulture is ok for man. That's just learning about your environment and helping things grow.  Good for all.\n\nAgriculture is the magic killer. The plants enslave you, and you begin to destroy the natural environment.\n\nSo the ancient Luiseno had 4 days a week completely free,  to learn about spirits.\n\nTrust me when I say, I *saw* that vividly when I visited their old reservation, south of me.  A few weeks ago.  Some dead sorcerers put on a horse riding competition for me, visibly. In the middle of their now casino. Built on top of where they had been pushed by the Europeans.\n\nKeep in mind, back then, 10,000 years ago,  there wasn't much of a river of shit. It was more like a \"pond of shit\".  With easy exits.\n\nSo mating and reproducing didn't consume all of their thoughts.\n\nAnd the spirits taught them magic to fill their time.\n\nBut inorganic beings have no \"ultimate magical destination\" in mind, so they had endless \"systems\".\n\nThey'd custom tailor a \"new system\" to the whims of the native population they were helping.\n\nIt wasn't fake crap magic like we have today.  \n\nModern \"systems\" are merely support groups for people who like to play magic man.\n\nIn fact, each \"system\" back then was AMAZING.  The loss to mankind of those, is considered a huge tragedy somewhere out there in infinity.\n\nWe only have one of the originals left, as far as I know. Olmec sorcery.\n\nBut the \"originals\" didn't instantly vanish. They got absorbed into the emerging agriculture and big city life, slowly losing their power to greed.\n\nBoth of those civilizations would have had some of that lingering real magic, and it was always originally from inorganic beings.\n\nBut the Jews were obviously inept, by the time they wrote the bible.\n\nI don't know anything about the Egyptians, but they were hanging out in the same area.\n\nAs were the Akkadians, who mixed with an African sorceress related to Shiba (or maybe even her), became the Chinese.\n\nThe odd thing is, those older systems can be restored from any left over intact pieces.\n\nThey were phantom rooms.  Even a left over piece, can be re-inflated.\n\nAs Cholita and Minx showed me in the last week.\n\nI always figure out what IOBs are up to, much later.  Not at the time.\n\nThat's possibly why don Juan recommended keeping a journal.\n\nWe don't need it, this place is our journal.\n\nBut the journal, if it isn't attention seeking mental masturbation, can be very helpful.\n\nJournal... NOT a future book deal.\n\nThe IOBs will do something that seems random, but when you look back on it, they'd been leading up to that for a long time.\n\nMinx had been whining like a puppy in the phantom house copy pretending to be trapped without Cholita.  When Cholita found a new place to live, the phantom realm started to reduce in height, coming up from the floor, and down from the ceiling.\n\nMinx made me very aware of that, with completely realistic sound coming from behind my wall.  I even had to get  up to check a couple of times, to make sure it wasn't \"real\". Maybe some animal had gotten into the hallway behind my bed.\n\nThen Cholita appeared in the flattened copy, smashed to death. She likes to be dramatic.\n\nSeveral more times she appeared, alive and able to lead me into the flattened house copy.  I thought at the time she wanted me to follow it all the way past Long beach, the furthest I'd traveled into it, when Cholita was still living in my home.

Wish I could remember who, so they got credit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mystery&amp;quot; tends to give out that sort of historical information, but I can&amp;#39;t say it was in fact her.  I do remember however, it was just about the time she became annoyed I still referred to her as male.  Or to be more precise, she didn&amp;#39;t like being &amp;quot;dismissed&amp;quot; as unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically before agriculture, mankind hunted and gathered the food they needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes that was hard, but the Luiseno here in my area, 10,000 years ago, only had to work 3 days a week because they became so good at food gathering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likely acorns and fish was their easiest food supply,  but there were also lots of prey to hunt.  Jackrabbits were the abundant, especially once they learned to flood grasslands and make them grow lush.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Horticulture is ok for man. That&amp;#39;s just learning about your environment and helping things grow.  Good for all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Agriculture is the magic killer. The plants enslave you, and you begin to destroy the natural environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the ancient Luiseno had 4 days a week completely free,  to learn about spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trust me when I say, I &lt;em&gt;saw&lt;/em&gt; that vividly when I visited their old reservation, south of me.  A few weeks ago.  Some dead sorcerers put on a horse riding competition for me, visibly. In the middle of their now casino. Built on top of where they had been pushed by the Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, back then, 10,000 years ago,  there wasn&amp;#39;t much of a river of shit. It was more like a &amp;quot;pond of shit&amp;quot;.  With easy exits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So mating and reproducing didn&amp;#39;t consume all of their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the spirits taught them magic to fill their time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But inorganic beings have no &amp;quot;ultimate magical destination&amp;quot; in mind, so they had endless &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;d custom tailor a &amp;quot;new system&amp;quot; to the whims of the native population they were helping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t fake crap magic like we have today.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Modern &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot; are merely support groups for people who like to play magic man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, each &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; back then was AMAZING.  The loss to mankind of those, is considered a huge tragedy somewhere out there in infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We only have one of the originals left, as far as I know. Olmec sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the &amp;quot;originals&amp;quot; didn&amp;#39;t instantly vanish. They got absorbed into the emerging agriculture and big city life, slowly losing their power to greed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both of those civilizations would have had some of that lingering real magic, and it was always originally from inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the Jews were obviously inept, by the time they wrote the bible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know anything about the Egyptians, but they were hanging out in the same area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As were the Akkadians, who mixed with an African sorceress related to Shiba (or maybe even her), became the Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The odd thing is, those older systems can be restored from any left over intact pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were phantom rooms.  Even a left over piece, can be re-inflated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Cholita and Minx showed me in the last week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always figure out what IOBs are up to, much later.  Not at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s possibly why don Juan recommended keeping a journal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t need it, this place is our journal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the journal, if it isn&amp;#39;t attention seeking mental masturbation, can be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Journal... NOT a future book deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The IOBs will do something that seems random, but when you look back on it, they&amp;#39;d been leading up to that for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx had been whining like a puppy in the phantom house copy pretending to be trapped without Cholita.  When Cholita found a new place to live, the phantom realm started to reduce in height, coming up from the floor, and down from the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Minx made me very aware of that, with completely realistic sound coming from behind my wall.  I even had to get  up to check a couple of times, to make sure it wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;. Maybe some animal had gotten into the hallway behind my bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then Cholita appeared in the flattened copy, smashed to death. She likes to be dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several more times she appeared, alive and able to lead me into the flattened house copy.  I thought at the time she wanted me to follow it all the way past Long beach, the furthest I&amp;#39;d traveled into it, when Cholita was still living in my home.  That&amp;#39; a good 40 miles.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now I think, she just wanted me to sneak though my bedroom wall using it, so I&amp;#39;d realize what it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then Minx and Cholita re-inflated it using the IOB realm, and threw a party to make sure I didn&amp;#39;t forget what I&amp;#39;d witnessed.

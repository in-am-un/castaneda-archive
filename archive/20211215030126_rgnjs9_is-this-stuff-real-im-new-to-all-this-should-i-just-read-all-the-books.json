Always with the implication men now don't have the kind of power they did way back then.\n\nIt's not post agriculture people fantasizing about giants and people who could fly.  As some commentators suggest.\n\nIt's because they stole their original techniques and descriptions from those guys, and are giving them a \"nod\".  \n\nTake the Jewish prophets, perhaps the oldest among religions.  People like to think eastern traditions are the oldest, but it's not so. They just have better marketing in western countries (bad player western men marketing).\n\nThe Jewish technique to see god and spirits is pretty much the same as ours, and the results the same.\n\nExcept they never learned to \"see\", so it was ritualized and religious.\n\nIt's easy to see God, but not so easy to realize he's static and can't really do much.\n\nDon't anyone worry, visiting God is automatic.   You will too.\n\nHe's the mold of man.  When you *see* the essence of something human, the trail leads back to him and you simply find yourself looking at the source of that thing.\n\nOr to put it more \"scientifically\", if you gaze at the right collection of emanations, it's purely an aspect of God.  Just the human qualities, and nothing else, will lead right back to him. So you'll end up reskimming to stand before him.\n\nFor instance, last week I was watching a phantom world that had some people in it, which seemed to be from a Mumford and Son's video. Those are \"soccer hooligan\" style brits.  At least, they like to portray themselves that way. \n\nIt was floating in front of my eyes, and kind of an annoyance.  I didn't want to pay attention to that, but it \"insisted\".\n\nThere was a Scottish looking older man with missing teeth, but his hair was so red and wild he wasn't actually homely.  He was \"human\".  It was like looking at a scruffy lion.  \n\nI gazed at the vision in the air wondering what was that \"essence\" thing I felt, and I found my self zipping right up to God.\n\nHe was just looking at me, with a slightly different version of that particular look, answering my question about \"essences\" in men.\n\nShould have asked for something...  I always forget to do that.\n\nAnyway, the jews seem to have become God obsessed, as Carlos did.\n\nWhich to me means, they weren't very good at magic.

People like to think eastern traditions are the oldest, but it&amp;#39;s not so. They just have better marketing in western countries (bad player western men marketing).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Jewish technique to see god and spirits is pretty much the same as ours, and the results the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except they never learned to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;, so it was ritualized and religious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to see God, but not so easy to realize he&amp;#39;s static and can&amp;#39;t really do much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t anyone worry, visiting God is automatic.

So you&amp;#39;ll end up reskimming to stand before him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, last week I was watching a phantom world that had some people in it, which seemed to be from a Mumford and Son&amp;#39;s video.

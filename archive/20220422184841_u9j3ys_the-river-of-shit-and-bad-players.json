She reveals stuff in there that's perhaps not good for beginners to know.  Might even be why the book sat unpublished so long.  Cholita got a copy in 1996 or so, but then until recently there was no wide awareness of it.  The \"experts\" in Russia even claimed it was a fake, since it probably harmed their reputation.\n\nSo I'll leave you to read it if you like. What it reveals isn't good for beginners to know about, because they have a tendency to pretend their results to get attention.    It can be difficult to detect, and so it's best to avoid adding material for people to pretend which they usually use to  avoid work and still \"feel good about themselves\".  By pretending to be making progress.\n\nIt's actually a rather horrible battle for myself at times.  A promising person, often a woman, comes along, I notice them, and we end up doing what I don't like to do anymore. Chatting.\n\nAnd I have to keep saying, \"Yes, but don't emphasize that part...  You need it REAL, and it's too easy to fool yourself with that kind of thinking...   NO, not that!  No one has ever made that work in all the time his books came out!  How are you going to be the first?\"\n\nAnything to get out of work.  That seems to be the motto of most who are interested in actually trying to make the books of Carlos work.\n\nThen there's the lonely people.  Maybe so horrible that no one wants to be their friend, so they've become \"spooks\".  Energy Vampires.  They roam around the internet trying to find human contact, to fill some hole in their life.  Mostly caused by their horrible attitude.\n\nOur pictures attract them so they come in to the subreddit, figure out what they need to pretend to be interested in, and then periodically try to get away with posting.  Never with learning.\n\nIf they get called out they tend to escalate, but hide a while before their \"next move\".\n\nOne recently hauled out a Hindu \"saint\" so horrible, he really ought to have been cast in jail. Not turned into a holy religious icon.\n\nWho cares?\n\nActually, we all need to care.\n\nAnd that's what's hidden in Taisha's latest book.\n\nBut you've already read how Cholita made a phantom copy of our home, and then kept adding to it.  The initial version was IDENTICAL to our real house.  No one going in there would have realized it was not.\n\nI entered it, fully awake, by the simple method of opening the hallway door, and walking into the living room.  A similar method is used to enter the phantom house where Carlos used to live, except there's nothing but a support beam to indicate the spot.\n\nThe first clue something was wrong was perhaps that Cholita seemed to be in a good mood.  She was outside in her little garden paradise, digging a hole.   The side door was wide open so I could see her.\n\nAs I approached I saw a lizard crawling across the wooden floor, with 1 inch toe nails.    They were making a very annoying sound, but otherwise it looked like Cholita had gotten herself a pet.  She's a scout type, and often hops a train to nowhere, gone for weeks.  When she comes back she brings \"stuff\".  Not all is \"real\" as people normally use the word.\n\nI walked towards Cholita to complain there's a weird animal on the floor, but she didn't turn around.  She was bent way over digging  that hole, in a proactive manner.\n\nI turned to look back at the lizard, so I could describe it better, but now it was a squirrel.  Standing on its hind legs, begging for food.\n\nI realized, that's not a real organic creature.  Her demon friend \"Minx\" started to come to mind. I'd long suspected he was Devil's Weed entity, because Carlos released his Allies to his private class. One I had as a friend, who when following Cholita in daylight looks exactly like a little puff of white smoke, the size of a golf ball. She's literally a \"little smoke\" ball in full daylight. I named her \"Fairy\".\n\nIf this one, which I nicknamed Minx after Cholita tried to use it to scare me to death,  likes to manifest as a lizard, maybe it's just the Devil's weed entity?  Carlos gave us BOTH of his allies, and they'd been scaring the hell out of me for at least 15 years since he died.\n\nAt any rate, Cholita maintained her phantom copy of the house just as Carlos had a phantom copy of his home on Pandora. It's still there to this day.\n\nMiles once walked in the one at Pandora by accident, and I'm pretty sure Carlos invited me over alone just to try to get me to walk in there too.  He placed me 1 foot from the entrance, and left to get me some food he'd prepared,  in the kitchen.\n\nBut I didn't move an inch. You don't wander around aimlessly, in a home occupied by witches.\n\nCarlos never insisted anyone do anything. He possibly hoped I'd turn around, and walk 2 feet.  But he didn't tell me to.\n\nEven if he'd asked you to do something important, later he'd claim it was just a stalking maneuver and you didn't mess up anything by not accepting the task. He didn't like to leave people with burdens.\n\nI got a couple of HUGE offers but turned them down, still not understanding what he was up to.\n\nSo just remember this: phantom copies of real places, are common among sorcerers.  The death defier created an entire village at Tula, complete with church.  I wouldn't be surprised if he spent 100 years in there.  And you first create the structure, with a single object. Or a single room. And expand it from there.\n\nCholita's is now 60 miles long, at least.  She keeps spreading it back towards Santa Monica, where Dance Home is located.\n\nSo we **don't** want to bring shit, into phantom structures.\n\nThat's what the energy vampires in here do.  When they don't study, and don't learn, because they aren't interested, they try to find some other excuse to suck up attention. They'll post something they believe is relevant, like some con artist who copies Carlos, and is stealing from people.  But they're too clueless to realize that's very harmful to beginners.\n\nIf they get called out they go back into hiding for a bit, but then later haul out something else, thinking it's just topics \"related\" to Carlos that gets them in trouble.  So they'll haul out some horrible \"saint\" from another religion, as if they had \"found some other real magic!\"\n\nThey drag stuff in, from the river of shit.\n\nOnto the dry land we've created here!\n\nLearning sorcery can only be done with stories.  Unfortunately, real magic extends into thousands of other realms.  The real thing can't be limited to a single copy of reality.\n\nTo explain it you almost are forced to use a story, so you can add \"hints\" of the other realms, within the story line.\n\nOne story used to teach all apprentices, is the \"River of Shit\".\n\nGo look it up if interested.\n\nTo learn sorcery you have to climb out of the river of shit.  If you do, sorcerers are waiting to hose you off.\n\nSome of these will be seen, but most will not.  All you'll notice is when they wash you off a bit, but you won't be able to remember their faces.\n\nOnce on dry land, you are now in a phantom copy of reality.\n\nIf you keep leaning over to haul crap out of the River of Shit, you damage the new reality bubble in which you reside.\n\nYou damage it for EVERYONE in here.\n\nI don't suppose we mind too much, if a sincere learner does that by mistake.\n\nBut the bad players do it on purpose.  To shock a little.  To get themselves more attention, and feel a tiny bit of power over others.\n\nThey piss on your leg, like a dog.\n\nNow back to the \"secrets\" in Taisha's book, that you aren't supposed to know yet.\n\nWithout some effort to indicate you aren't a complete pretender.\n\nThis subreddit is a phantom reality.\n\nIt's inevitable such a thing will form, where real sorcery is being practiced.\n\nIt's very bad to haul crap from the River of Shit,  into it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The River Of Shit And Bad Players", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Flyers (counter intent)"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ku3k0xykw3v81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ku3k0xykw3v81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7633cac407f43f9c53d6920c23654f715ccb410b"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ku3k0xykw3v81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fa9d59873dedf076eb9ded4514bf9d9d595f5dc"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ku3k0xykw3v81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe8e8fc579e47044dd6b0f4355c30173af5446c9"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ku3k0xykw3v81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a67622b6a434c30de9de3ad5c0562540766cfba7"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ku3k0xykw3v81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13b3ed75eeb54babdc387d7f302cf1b9a0055b65"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ku3k0xykw3v81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fe28bdca5f5a8a93c79992255f469e4daaea2b9"}], "s": {"y": 2592, "x": 2592, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ku3k0xykw3v81.jpg?width=2592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe5fe78a659d50bfe31b98912b823f54913ce0bc"}, "id": "ku3k0xykw3v81"}}, "name": "t3_u9j3ys", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 22, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Flyers (counter intent)", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 22, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/94ayIPMcguYUPp_JiHKZvYcFWSiWfw9lM-59vJ3eqEk.jpg", "edited": 1650647091.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1650646121.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ku3k0xykw3v81.jpg?width=2592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fe5fe78a659d50bfe31b98912b823f54913ce0bc\"&gt;A favorite hobby of bad player energy vampire types: Hauling shit into the subreddit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realized last night after moving my assemblage point very far, that stuff goes on when teaching sorcery that the apprentices don&amp;#39;t know about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taisha&amp;#39;s latest book is the best one to see that.

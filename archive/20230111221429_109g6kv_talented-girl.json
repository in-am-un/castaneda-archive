No kidding.  Just look at the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For special effects that is.  His &amp;quot;Movie magic&amp;quot; is a bit too much.  We don&amp;#39;t know of anyone that powerful in our group. But there are rumors of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s simply the kind of magic that makes you pee your pants, until you get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you look around in here at the posts and the pictures?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We do actual magic in here, not make believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 8000 years old.  Easy to prove that too, just by looking around in the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friends the Luiseno who live in my area, have relics 10,000 years old right nearby where I&amp;#39;m typing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The J curve diagram has the most pictures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please study it so you understand where you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the only place with real magic on the internet, as far as any has been able to find.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even_better_j_curve_diagram/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mtfwhb/even_better_j_curve_diagram/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it takes actual effort to learn it, and other &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot; don&amp;#39;t. They give you some easy to do make believe technique, take your money, and hope you go away before you figure out you were tricked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one in here takes any money.  And all we hope is that you&amp;#39;ll actually try, see real magic, and then decide if you&amp;#39;re willing to work that hard for the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most are not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s good to at least one time in your life, see that real magic does exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_109g6kv", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/109g6kv/talented_girl/j3yevka/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1673476565.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j3ycftf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "herrwaldos", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1673475647.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_109g6kv", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_1iiqxkg3", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Ok, well, I was thinking about this for some weeks - I have seen a lot of young ladies doing this or similar dances on TikTok, Insta or YTube shorts.\n\nI think in Germany they call it Shuffle or Jump style... like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LricihvHehs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LricihvHehs)\n\nI remember, in the books or PDFs somewhere I read about certain movements - that channel the energies - upwards, if I understand well. \n\nI noticed some of that looked similar to Rock-n-Roll and Funk dancing - especially what James Brown was doing.

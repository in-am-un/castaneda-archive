But hide and seek isn't much of a game.\n\nGive it some rules!\n\nBut you only put the puffs of light onto her, if she's visible.\n\nOtherwise you keep it for yourself.\n\nAs you do it more and more she'll start to follow you around, to make sure she's there when you find it. She may even point out spots to you.\n\nBut we aren't actually, \"feeding\" her.\n\nWe wouldn't want her to get fat!\n\n(A joke)\n\nWhat we're really doing is exposing her to the inside of our own luminous shell, and interacting at each spot.\n\nSo that she picks up any emanations that are common to her and you both, and those get emphasized in her.\n\nSo don't expect her to actually open her mouth, and suck up purple slime.\n\nYou wish!\n\nWait a minute...\n\nPrince???  Black lights??? Purple Rain??? I'd love to see you standing in that purple rain?\n\nNah...\n\nAs for the blobs of light, it's good enough to brush it where she seems to be.\n\nAnd you can blow into her also. Or growl at her.\n\nResult: The little floating head will become full sized, stand up, and walk across your room.\n\nHopefully with a smile.  I'd be surprised if she was still trying to frighten you, after all that pleasant interaction.\n\nBut you won't see her turn solid all at once.\n\nYou'll hardly notice when it happens.\n\nMaybe once or twice you'll see her head, with a possible bit of shoulders attached.\n\nOr an arm.\n\nOr get a glimpse of what she's wearing.\n\nWhen you start to see more than just what you started with, you're on the right track.\n\nBut don't forget, intent has a delay. And the IOBs have an even longer one.\n\nI once commented to Fairy, \"How come you spend all your time with Cholita these days?  Can't we be closer?\"\n\nShe just disappeared.\n\nMany seconds later, her world materialized around me. I was standing there in her world, looking right at her, embedded in some kind of matrix.\n\nAt the time I didn't realize, she'd taken my request literally.

If it&amp;#39;s an intense puff, then no scooping is needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;amp;t=5m22s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt7n2273_PU&amp;amp;t=5m22s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you see your IOB, scoop it on to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t, put it on your torso.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep scanning the room and turning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goal is to catch the attention of the IOB, in a &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; of sorts, which results in her being rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She WANTS to interact.  But hide and seek isn&amp;#39;t much of a game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Give it some rules!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you only put the puffs of light onto her, if she&amp;#39;s visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you keep it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you do it more and more she&amp;#39;ll start to follow you around, to make sure she&amp;#39;s there when you find it. She may even point out spots to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we aren&amp;#39;t actually, &amp;quot;feeding&amp;quot; her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We wouldn&amp;#39;t want her to get fat!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(A joke)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we&amp;#39;re really doing is exposing her to the inside of our own luminous shell, and interacting at each spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that she picks up any emanations that are common to her and you both, and those get emphasized in her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t expect her to actually open her mouth, and suck up purple slime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You wish!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prince???  Black lights??? Purple Rain??? I&amp;#39;d love to see you standing in that purple rain?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nah...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the blobs of light, it&amp;#39;s good enough to brush it where she seems to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you can blow into her also. Or growl at her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Result: The little floating head will become full sized, stand up, and walk across your room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully with a smile.  I&amp;#39;d be surprised if she was still trying to frighten you, after all that pleasant interaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you won&amp;#39;t see her turn solid all at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll hardly notice when it happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe once or twice you&amp;#39;ll see her head, with a possible bit of shoulders attached.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or an arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or get a glimpse of what she&amp;#39;s wearing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you start to see more than just what you started with, you&amp;#39;re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#39;t forget, intent has a delay. And the IOBs have an even longer one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I once commented to Fairy, &amp;quot;How come you spend all your time with Cholita these days?  Can&amp;#39;t we be closer?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She just disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many seconds later, her world materialized around me.

Well known.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like confirmation you&amp;#39;re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women need to be part of a community I suspect.  And there&amp;#39;s no way a single male sorcerer can provide that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, unfortunately, we don&amp;#39;t have women in Cleargreen powerful enough to teach other women to move their assemblage points (or we would have  heard crazy things about cool stuff).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we have to make a substitute &amp;quot;community&amp;quot;, in the form of experiences and descriptions showing where you are on the path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a &amp;quot;club&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the men, maybe not so much.  They mostly want power, so they&amp;#39;ll either try to get it, or they won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they want help, it&amp;#39;s just on how to hold the club they manufactured, to get the maximum striking force (a metaphor meaning men are oriented to impress others and take down someone in the process if at all possible).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have someone right now with an effect I don&amp;#39;t understand well.  I wish I could give him advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tested his concern out last night, and what he&amp;#39;s describing doesn&amp;#39;t happen to me, when I play with blackness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we had a community of waking dreamers, someone would know what to tell him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/i5o2m4/summoner_darkroom/g0wfq93/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1596988088.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_i5o2m4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g0tnupc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1596919089.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g0td6l9", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Hhahahhaha.

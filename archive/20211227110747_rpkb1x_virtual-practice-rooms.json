Probably more properly you might say the purpose of the group is to use \"Readers of Infinity\" technology as given to us by Carlos, to raid instead of read.\n\nRaiders of Infinity.  Ok, sounds too much like a movie title, but the basic principle is sound.  And Carlos came up with some pretty cheesy names if we're to be honest about it.\n\nFancy had  a rather smug look on her face, after showing me her idea of a virtual practice room.\n\n\"Is that it for now?\",  I asked her.\n\nBut my assemblage point was firmly in the middle, a happy side effect of Fancy's VPR (virtual practice room).\n\nWhich meant, at that distant  position of the assemblage point, I was in heaven.\n\nAll around me the walls were stuffed with amazing toys and jewels.  I had only to reach into the surface of a wall, stir it with my hand, and \"stuff\" began to form.\n\nThere was no change in mood over time, or by activity.  Typically darkroom practice that far out on the J curve, comes with slight moodiness.  You can be doing miracles that would get you a huge saintly book deal in any religion, but suddenly it's boring.   You're holding real, genuine fairy dust in your hand, can cast it into the air and watch a shower of sparkles fall, and  yet, still it's boring.\n\nOr worse.  You hit a \"sneeze zone\".  You see an amazing formation on the wall, composed of pleasing pinkish peach stucco like texture, and as you glance into it, the secrets of the universe are about to be revealed to you.\n\nBut instead, you sneeze.\n\nBut I was worried about forgetting everything Fancy had shown me, and wanted to get out my laptop, which I've done now.\n\nAt the time I was worried about losing precious information, so I reached my hand into the wall again trying to understand how to describe the potential of a virtual practice room.  I wanted to see if stuff formed from pink gas, or was behind the pink gas from the start.\n\n\"Localized Micro-translocations!\", Fancy explained.\n\nApparently the entire room is translocation energized.  Not just a single wall, but every square inch of the room has the potential to form a virtual reality.  It's like being in the edges of a crystalline puff.\n\nThe tensegrity is full of those, she added.\n\n\"But I need to write this down\", I suggested, pink smoke oozing off my right hand, after having stuck it into the walls.\n\n\"No, that's not the best part!\", Fancy hinted.\n\nShe flew left and faded into nothing.  She was mostly just a head floating in the purple and black mists at that point.  But she could animate faster than normal, probably because we'd been sharing energy so long.  It had to be hours at that point.\n\nI turned to see where she'd gone, expecting to be shown the best part of all.\n\nI got a sudden fright when I saw one of Fancy's \"friends\" stuck on the virtual wall, like a head on a  shelf.\n\n\"It comes with shelves!\", she added.\n\nMy mind was racing with the idea that you could put something you raided from infinity on a shelf in a virtual practice room, and the next day it was still there.\n\n\"You mean  you get to keep stuff?\", I asked her.\n\n\"Yea, but don't become a hoarder.\", she chuckled.  She  had a malicious grin on her face.  She'd materialized to the right of the head on the shelf, maybe so I knew that wasn't her head, and was a proper, \"real\" object on a real shelf.\n\nI glanced around the room and got a bit suspicious.\n\n\"Looks a lot like an inorganic being's cave to me.\", I complained.\n\n\"The shape is optional.\", she explained.  \"you always get obsessed with square rooms.  The important thing is to have enough space to move around.  The tensegrity alone needs 20 feet in either direction, if you don't want to bump into any walls.\"\n\nI felt like I was about to sign a lease on an apartment in the bad area of town.\n\n\"I'll think about it, and see if it makes any sense when I type it all out\", I told her.\n\nNow, here I am typing, and I'm afraid it's too late.  I lost most of it.\n\nMy idea had been to use, \"the wall\" to teach people to reskim emanations on demand.\n\nOr more properly, Lily had liked that idea.  I woke up this morning aware they were floating above my head arguing like a current girlfriend who's teamed up with your ex, leaving you a bit worried about what they discuss when you aren't around.\n\nThey'd decided things were a mess, and it wasn't going well.  We needed a practical activity, so the women didn't get bored to death, trying to obsess over minor technical details of how the assemblage point movement changes things.\n\nFancy suggested we steal the death defiers village.\n\n\"They don't need it anymore\", she had explained.  And she insisted we could surely find it.\n\n\"How?\" I asked her, a little too far into the second attention to realize, we were now sitting around a kitchen table discussing things.\n\n\"Phantom rooms have unstable sides\", she explained.\n\n\"No matter how stable they look there's always an end to it. And beyond the end, the emanations are trying to create something new, but on the border areas it's just fuzz.\"\n\nShe reminded me how I'd chased Cholita nearly 10 miles in our phantom copy of the house, headed for Long Beach. I'd discovered that Cholita's resort hotel addition to our garage was split in half on the north end, and lead to a very confusing railroad system with tracks in the air, and switches that sent trains hurtling down into a dark cavern below.\n\nCholita likes trains.  Especially sleeper trains.\n\nI have a theory about why, but it's not much.  Probably men hit on her all night long on a sleeper train.\n\nI flew over the tracks in Cholita's extension of the resort, and noticed we were headed to Long Beach, which was a logical place to expand to since that beach is south of Santa Monica Beach, one of her favorite places in LA.\n\nI could see vast stretches of buildings and roads materialize just ahead of Cholita.\n\nBut I couldn't catch up with her, so I dropped to the ground and landed near an oil refinery.\n\nFancy had commented, \"The edges are not only always trying to form, but they're like a magnet.  They'll form a bend in reality that connects them to another phantom room nearby.\"\n\n\"Given a little luck, Pandora connects to the death defier's village, at some hole or break in the wall in the back yard\", she explained.\n\nIf you gain entry to that phantom copy of the old home of Carlos, you can locate the death defier's village through an unfinished part there.  It'll stretch to connect to Pandora.  Someone might even have used it a few times.\"\n\nShe reminded me that Carlos had shown me the entrance himself, and then given me a gift of half a pear with Mexican crema on it, the pear possibly having grown at Pandora.  He wanted me to go in there.\n\nI wish I could recall all Fancy showed me about how to use a VPR.\n\nIt was weird stuff that made a lot of sense at the time, some of which was connected to moving, and not to being stationary.  Fancy had explained, if you are in the second attention, better move around or you will lose control of your translocation.  It \"drifts\".\n\nIf you move around it mutates, but that's the value of a VPR.  Any mutations of that translocated room tend to remain \"roomish\".  So as long as you move around, you're still in the \"same one\".\n\nShe suggested I test that out by doing lobster strike right in front of me.\n\nThe result was that a perfect 3D rectangular object made of glowing green light structured as metal rods of a cage, rotated in space to absorb the energy of the strike, and then shrank right before my eyes, absorbed into the floor.\n\nDoesn't make sense now.\n\nOther random things I can recall:  The floor was perfectly sharp.  I could see details such as you'd see on a natural surface outdoors, and the focus was intense.\n\nI have a problem with phantom room focus.\n\nA phantom room has a certain \"feel\" to it while it's forming.  When it finishes, you get a jolt of \"recognition\".\n\nIt's like a little shock wave goes out when the phantom room decides what it's going to look like, and when the shock wave hits you, you \"recognize\" a room.\n\nBut even with the feeling that this is certainly a room now, and not just second attention fog, the details can be so blurry  you have to squint to see if that's a painting on the wall, or some structural details.\n\nI always wonder why sometimes, the focus is so intense it's like looking at the new high def TV at the mall, and being shocked at how good the image looks.\n\nGlancing at the floor Fancy commented, \"That part of the room has real energy behind it.  It really exists.  When it's blurry, it's only your energy.\"\n\n\"Why is this part of the floor, real?\", I asked.\n\nShe didn't seem to want to answer and changed the subject.\n\n\"Don't worry about the focus.  Remember Cholita's copy of the house?  It only had the energy of 4, and you couldn't tell it apart from the real thing except for the weirdness.\"\n\nI looked at the walls, and they hadn't even bothered to form a smooth surface.  In fact I got the impression if you moved a certain direction, the walls might \"back up\" to give you more space.\n\nFancy had also explained that the VPR is better than using \"the wall\" to meet people in the second attention, because one person's VPR will stretch to connect to the other person's room.\n\nThey're like bubbles in space, but when they touch another bubble they form into a single one, with both people now present in the same VPR.\n\nIf you want to use the whitish light of \"the wall\", you'd have to teach people to form the same translocation reality.  A nearly impossible task, when both people are not located in the same vicinity.\n\nI'm afraid, that's all I remember now.\n\nI got quite a lecture on how \"active\" tensegrity really is, when done in a phantom room. It's like being covered in fluorescent gas that evaporates from your limbs as they move around, then becoming alive itself for a few seconds, as the energy of awareness dissipates.\n\nI also got a lecture on why tensegrity inevitably brings out the double.\n\nSomething to do with, if you see it, that's him.  Those puffs are him!\n\nAnd to control him, you just need to see the puffs.\n\nWhen the puffs are dispersed to the outside, it's like a kid sticking his face against  a car window, watching the world go by.  The double is like that, but he has many faces.\n\nSo he's got 6  heads pressed up against the periphery of our luminous shell, watching 6 realities at once.\n\nWhich he can't do, so he flows from one reality to the other, irrationally.\n\nJust scoop him into the middle.  So he can perceive what you are perceiving.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Virtual Practice Rooms", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Places of Power"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"9j9lk96vya881": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 199, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9j9lk96vya881.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad7f91b2fcc17f5665ddcc75b556f2bb96cfbdcf"}, {"y": 398, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9j9lk96vya881.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a4857f9dab64b45a77c7236eda36a6ec6d29911"}, {"y": 589, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9j9lk96vya881.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72ce2383b53534f7174c0f97096b5800dcf16afb"}], "s": {"y": 645, "x": 350, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/9j9lk96vya881.jpg?width=350&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=758dfd6d0c9539b57656527b44a8831291dc979b"}, "id": "9j9lk96vya881"}}, "name": "t3_rpkb1x", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 12, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Places of Power", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Wip-dTwqu44v1fwebs3yRR3Tsd8epnlDQcf6Lkfhg-0.jpg", "edited": 1640705795.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1640599667.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9j9lk96vya881.jpg?width=350&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=758dfd6d0c9539b57656527b44a8831291dc979b\"&gt;The Key to Tensegrity???&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A warning: it gets weird at the end of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just now I was glancing up to my right at Fancy, who had taken over my practice session.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d been trying to figure out a common meeting place in the second attention, which could possibly be used to form a group that can meet in waking dreaming, in order to pull off a heist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The heist was Fancy&amp;#39;s idea.

In fact I got the impression if you moved a certain direction, the walls might &amp;quot;back up&amp;quot; to give you more space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy had also explained that the VPR is better than using &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot; to meet people in the second attention, because one person&amp;#39;s VPR will stretch to connect to the other person&amp;#39;s room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re like bubbles in space, but when they touch another bubble they form into a single one, with both people now present in the same VPR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to use the whitish light of &amp;quot;the wall&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;d have to teach people to form the same translocation reality.  A nearly impossible task, when both people are not located in the same vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid, that&amp;#39;s all I remember now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got quite a lecture on how &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; tensegrity really is, when done in a phantom room. It&amp;#39;s like being covered in fluorescent gas that evaporates from your limbs as they move around, then becoming alive itself for a few seconds, as the energy of awareness dissipates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also got a lecture on why tensegrity inevitably brings out the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something to do with, if you see it, that&amp;#39;s him.  Those puffs are him!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to control him, you just need to see the puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the puffs are dispersed to the outside, it&amp;#39;s like a kid sticking his face against  a car window, watching the world go by.  The double is like that, but he has many faces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So he&amp;#39;s got 6  heads pressed up against the periphery of our luminous shell, watching 6 realities at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which he can&amp;#39;t do, so he flows from one reality to the other, irrationally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just scoop him into the middle.  So he can perceive what you are perceiving.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "36d7fbc6-6006-11ea-8a0a-0eb484a5c2d1", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "rpkb1x", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 12, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rpkb1x/virtual_practice_rooms/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/rpkb1x/virtual_practice_rooms/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1640599667.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hqahtxt", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1640708020.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hqahowo", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "(the rest)\n\n\"As you do the tensegrity and your assemblage point moves, the double is lured to come near.

I like to warm up with it, until I can see the yellow glow of energy at my feet.\n\nAs you mash, the floor becomes visible. And if that isn't enough, the rest of the mashing movements slide back and forth, and push the light around on the floor.\n\nYou go from absolutely dark room, to standing on yellowish light.\n\nI was gazing down at the floor when I realized, mashing energy is the FASTEST way to \"hint\" at a phantom room!  In fact, floors are more critical indicators of the quality of a VPR than the walls.\n\nFancy showed up rapidly when I finished, as if she'd just rushed in from the shopping mall.\n\nShe was wearing a fancy hat and her hair had been done up.\n\nAll this red zone activity must have charged her up.\n\nI wanted to complain, but when I looked at her, she had a grin.\n\n\"Nice to see you Fancy!  You look lovely\", I told her instead.\n\nShe got started right away.\n\nShe glanced at the floor I had just lit up, and said, \"Each tensegrity move has the potential to do something like that.\"\n\nConsider them like building blocks.  Find out what they do, and use that to construct any type of VPN room you like!\n\nI felt stupid. How many times had I been looking down at the floor after mashing energy, judging how high my energy had risen, meanwhile wondering how I can make a phantom room as quickly as possible.\n\nI was standing on one!\n\nI already felt dull, so complaining to Fancy wasn't going to hurt anything.\n\nI started to tell her that although it's easier, I can't encourage new people to build red zone phantom rooms.\n\nThen, Fancy started the \"over teaching\" thing the Emissary can do.\n\nWhere you want to rush for paper to write on, but are afraid to move at all.\n\nI kept wanting to stop and write what I had down so fr,  on my computer.\n\nAt one point Fancy commented, \"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas!\"\n\nI instantly understood what she meant.\n\nIf you learn something in deep heightened awareness, you can never lose it.\n\nIt's where it's needed, stored permanently.\n\nLet's say, a silly example, a big Pacman appears in the air, trying to eat everything in sight.\n\nYour magical spirit shows you how to create a pathway of floating dots, which he immediately starts to chomp into pieces, until he reaches the end of the path you made and goes though the wall.\n\nSaved!\n\nBut the next day, you have absolutely no memory of it.\n\nWhich I suppose is kind of good.  Your friend may accept the sorcery thing as a \"quirk\" you have, but if you mention Pacman, you're in trouble.\n\nAnd yet, if you find yourself in the darkroom and a giant Pacman threatens, you absolutely will indeed remember what to do about it.\n\nSo you have to accept, \"memory belongs to that position of the assemblage point\", as Fancy put it.\n\nI suppose, the only way you remember it at another position is that you kept repeating it to  yourself with words, and the words are mostly what you can recall about it.\n\nWhich makes it dangerous to post in here.  When you post an experience, you alter it.\n\nStorytelling is powerful, especially with sorcery, where some realities you visit may only be partially finished.  When you have to alter how you tell the story so it makes sense, whatever you do to fix the holes in reality it contained, becomes are real as the other experience.\n\nCarlos warned us about this in his books, saying he did his best to convey heightened awareness events, but to give them the texture of daily life, he had to make some alterations.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to be able to repeat it that event again, the one you put into story formm, you'll be surprised to find those \"curtains\" you had to add to make a window's behavior during the experience, make sense.\n\nMaybe you made up the curtains because something was flapping there at a window-like portal,  on your wall.\n\nBut when you return the next night it's full on curtains, a curtain rod to hold them there, flower pattern, and some stray threats showing the curtains are not brand new.\n\nThose are from Cholita's curtains in the kitchen.  Apparently some of the \"new\" details copied her obsession with those particular curtains.\n\nYou just have to live with that.  As the witches like to say, \"We're dreaming ourselves these days.\"\n\nSo Fancy's rapid lesson on VPRs:\n\nI'm sorry if it doesn't flow well, I lost the rest.  It got amazingly weird.\n\nAs I recall I started to complain to fancy it was the red zone, and she said, \"It ages into the pink zone as you gaze.  And you can age that back and forth, to the whitish light.  The red zone is just to get it started, and because it's so darned invigorating in there!\"\n\nI looked, and indeed the walls were now pink, instead of being reddish with fire like details.\n\nA clock floated in front, to show the approximate passage of time as it aged. As I watched, the pink faded away, the second hand moved forward, and I was now in perfect whitish light, with vertical lines on all surfaces.\n\n\"It's a completely different room you know\", Fancy said.  \"Go back.\"\n\nI glanced at the walls, and they were again deep brown with red highlights, and jet black holes.\n\nIt was a real surface, and even looked organic.\n\nI went back to find the \"shelf\" Fancy had promised could keep things.  I saw the shelf, but the head was missing from last night.\n\nI wanted to complain to Fancy. She'd promised that if we stole stuff as a group, we could keep it as trophies in our darkroom.\n\nShe was on the other end of the room, and without realizing it I walked right through the bed. At least, where the bed should have been.\n\nFancy told me to turn around, and I saw that the path I walked was now a solid object.  Like it was made out of the left over burnt carbon those 4th of July snakes leave, as they burn and expand into a black snake.\n\nI'm not sure how this next part happened.  All I can do is describe what it was sort of like.\n\nAnd hope my description isn't too creepy, because it's going to \"overwrite\" what would have happened tonight. \n\nAnd some of my new part will show up.\n\nA large hand dropped a miniature Kylie doll in the middle of the practice room, and she started doing a long form.\n\nAs she moved along, she left a trail of that black puffy carbon, exactly the shape of where her body had moved, during the tensegrity.\n\nThere were probably even \"little finger\" trails you could find, if you examined the surface closely.\n\nFancy explained:  Each tensegrity move is 3 dimensional and trains part of your awareness.\n\nYou can recall the \"feeling\" of the structure it created.\n\nIf the structure exists there, the room must expand to hold it.\n\nSince the room is in the second attention, it's under control of the double.\n\nA combination of long forms can create a specific shape of VPR, but because the double has his own ideas, you can't count on the form being rigid or fixed.\n\nIt just sets the mood of the VPR.\n\nViolent, smooth, unsettling, spooky, soothing.  You could have different types of room, for different goals.  Different \"heists\".\n\nI looked at the carbon structure, and the double emerged from the lead of it. He leaned out.\n\nWasn't kylie anymore, but I didn't notice.\n\n(continued)", "edited": 1640708961.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hqahowo", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back into the darkroom hoping to find the same VPR, so I could complain to Fancy that it&amp;#39;s firmly in the red zone, and what is she up to?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She showed up in seconds, once I did mashing energy series.

How many times had I been looking down at the floor after mashing energy, judging how high my energy had risen, meanwhile wondering how I can make a phantom room as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was standing on one!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I already felt dull, so complaining to Fancy wasn&amp;#39;t going to hurt anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to tell her that although it&amp;#39;s easier, I can&amp;#39;t encourage new people to build red zone phantom rooms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, Fancy started the &amp;quot;over teaching&amp;quot; thing the Emissary can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where you want to rush for paper to write on, but are afraid to move at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept wanting to stop and write what I had down so fr,  on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At one point Fancy commented, &amp;quot;What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I instantly understood what she meant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you learn something in deep heightened awareness, you can never lose it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s where it&amp;#39;s needed, stored permanently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say, a silly example, a big Pacman appears in the air, trying to eat everything in sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your magical spirit shows you how to create a pathway of floating dots, which he immediately starts to chomp into pieces, until he reaches the end of the path you made and goes though the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saved!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the next day, you have absolutely no memory of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which I suppose is kind of good.  Your friend may accept the sorcery thing as a &amp;quot;quirk&amp;quot; you have, but if you mention Pacman, you&amp;#39;re in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, if you find yourself in the darkroom and a giant Pacman threatens, you absolutely will indeed remember what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you have to accept, &amp;quot;memory belongs to that position of the assemblage point&amp;quot;, as Fancy put it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose, the only way you remember it at another position is that you kept repeating it to  yourself with words, and the words are mostly what you can recall about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which makes it dangerous to post in here.  When you post an experience, you alter it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Storytelling is powerful, especially with sorcery, where some realities you visit may only be partially finished.  When you have to alter how you tell the story so it makes sense, whatever you do to fix the holes in reality it contained, becomes are real as the other experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos warned us about this in his books, saying he did his best to convey heightened awareness events, but to give them the texture of daily life, he had to make some alterations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are lucky enough to be able to repeat it that event again, the one you put into story formm, you&amp;#39;ll be surprised to find those &amp;quot;curtains&amp;quot; you had to add to make a window&amp;#39;s behavior during the experience, make sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you made up the curtains because something was flapping there at a window-like portal,  on your wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you return the next night it&amp;#39;s full on curtains, a curtain rod to hold them there, flower pattern, and some stray threats showing the curtains are not brand new.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are from Cholita&amp;#39;s curtains in the kitchen.  Apparently some of the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; details copied her obsession with those particular curtains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just have to live with that.  As the witches like to say, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re dreaming ourselves these days.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Fancy&amp;#39;s rapid lesson on VPRs:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry if it doesn&amp;#39;t flow well, I lost the rest.  It got amazingly weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I recall I started to complain to fancy it was the red zone, and she said, &amp;quot;It ages into the pink zone as you gaze.  And you can age that back and forth, to the whitish light.  The red zone is just to get it started, and because it&amp;#39;s so darned invigorating in there!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked, and indeed the walls were now pink, instead of being reddish with fire like details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A clock floated in front, to show the approximate passage of time as it aged. As I watched, the pink faded away, the second hand moved forward, and I was now in perfect whitish light, with vertical lines on all surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a completely different room you know&amp;quot;, Fancy said.  &amp;quot;Go back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced at the walls, and they were again deep brown with red highlights, and jet black holes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a real surface, and even looked organic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back to find the &amp;quot;shelf&amp;quot; Fancy had promised could keep things.  I saw the shelf, but the head was missing from last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to complain to Fancy. She&amp;#39;d promised that if we stole stuff as a group, we could keep it as trophies in our darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was on the other end of the room, and without realizing it I walked right through the bed. At least, where the bed should have been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy told me to turn around, and I saw that the path I walked was now a solid object.  Like it was made out of the left over burnt carbon those 4th of July snakes leave, as they burn and expand into a black snake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how this next part happened.  All I can do is describe what it was sort of like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And hope my description isn&amp;#39;t too creepy, because it&amp;#39;s going to &amp;quot;overwrite&amp;quot; what would have happened tonight. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And some of my new part will show up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A large hand dropped a miniature Kylie doll in the middle of the practice room, and she started doing a long form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As she moved along, she left a trail of that black puffy carbon, exactly the shape of where her body had moved, during the tensegrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were probably even &amp;quot;little finger&amp;quot; trails you could find, if you examined the surface closely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy explained:  Each tensegrity move is 3 dimensional and trains part of your awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can recall the &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; of the structure it created.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the structure exists there, the room must expand to hold it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the room is in the second attention, it&amp;#39;s under control of the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A combination of long forms can create a specific shape of VPR, but because the double has his own ideas, you can&amp;#39;t count on the form being rigid or fixed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just sets the mood of the VPR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Violent, smooth, unsettling, spooky, soothing.  You could have different types of room, for different goals.  Different &amp;quot;heists&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at the carbon structure, and the double emerged from the lead of it. He leaned out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;#39;t kylie anymore, but I didn&amp;#39;t notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(continued)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rpkb1x/virtual_practice_rooms/hqahowo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1640707962.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_rpkb1x", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hqfmvfh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1640799584.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_rpkb1x", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Part 3:\n\nAfter years, I've learned that eventually you learn what can be reproduced, and what was just an \"intent gift\" to keep you motivated.

At the same height on  your energy body, as the flowing fibers and tentacles.  They radiate out from relatively the same height on your body, which is around just below the belly button.\n\nThe \"dirt road\" is the only method for shapeshifting Fancy taught me, but it works well.\n\nDon't do that.

Just that, the double was the one who sees them clearly.  Or better said, he sees them as \"real\".\n\nThe tonal sees a \"ghost room\".\n\nTo move on from the red zone room, just keep forcing even deeper silence while you look at the walls all around you, trying to clearly see the \"shape\" of your phantom room.\n\nThat will move you to the pink zone.\n\nI'm afraid to say, I learned a trick about that. Or maybe Fancy tricked me into noticing it.\n\nI saw EXACTLY why the assemblage point goes under the bottom.\n\nThe men of knowledge never got their assemblage points to move to the front.\n\nDidn't know how.\n\nBut I saw exactly how.\n\nNow it's lost.\n\nSo just force silence.\n\nIf you know \"why\" it moves to the front, it only takes 10 seconds to get to the pink zone.\n\nIf you don't, it might take 20 minutes.\n\nThe red and black \"room\" of the red zone starts to lose color, and you have pinkish walls.\n\nBut as you gaze at them to see \"how pink they are\", they flatten into a rectangular room that looks more like a room than the cave that likely forms in the red zone.\n\nAnd even more color bleaches out.\n\nFinally you have the full on orange zone, which means your assemblage point moved to the front, and up at least an inch.\n\nIf it moves up 2 inches, the breath change happens.\n\nIf it moves all the way up to slightly above the belly button, the whitish light takes on a heavy texture.\n\nLast night it was vertical lines, my favorite.\n\nThen I got the idea to \"prove\" that a red zone phantom room was the correct starting point for beginners.\n\nI'd thought previously, that's dangerous. So they have to move all the way to the mid orange zone where they can \"read off the wall\".\n\n(Seeing energy).\n\nI had my phantom room there, it was bleached out to all grey and white, but I also had a flat patch of whitish light, with vertical lines.\n\nA perfect chance to test out which is faster.  Technically, that patch would be called, \"the wall\".\n\nI'd seen how long it took to form what I had, a whitish phantom room.\n\nSo I did the \"snapping the web\" pass, which several nights in a row had transformed my room into a piece of the Olmec jungle.\n\nA giant tree grows from the floor, breaks through the roof, and foliage appropriate it eastern Mexico forms next to the tree.\n\nI can enter the world of the Brujo's, in the space between the bushes and the tree.\n\nNow keep in mind, it never occurred to me to manifest something I actually had a use for.\n\nI just manifest random stuff, or I gaze at the whitish light until I find an imperfection, and that forms into something.\n\nIt also gives rise to random translocations, which is sort of like turning your wall into a computer monitor with a view of a lovely outdoor scene.\n\nI had no preference for what would happen, because I've learned that having one \"interferes\" and nothing works like it should.\n\nWe're \"reskimming\" emanations.  Anything in your mind, in your pocket, on your hand,  or even left in your stomach from dinner, is made of \"emanations\".\n\nAnd so when *intent* reskims them for you, a mandatory step to manifesting something, it uses what's more prominent to select the range of emanations.\n\nI hope I don't lose any beginners here.

The phantom room is all white.  It's made from the whitish light, which does not like to remain unformed and is always trying to change into something you can \"recognize\".\n\nI also realized, if you want to manifest stuff in the whitish light, it comes sooner, if you actaully have a pressuign use for it.\n\nNeed.

I knew also that it that was so, then I, too, was in my dreaming body and so was everyone in the room and that was why they seemed so sparkling. What's more, the house, the bench, the tables, the food that had been set out in the patio, a l l were part of another world. I had crossed over into the twin world without even realizing it. And that meant that the discoveries that everyone had been sharing, were not about some inaccessible distant dream world, but about the very reality which we were now inhabiting.\n\nThe minute I realized this, Emilito said, \"That's right' Taisha. I am the other side ot Zuleica, and you are your dream body, the other side of yourself. You have used the energetic wave trom the universe to cross over to the parallel world, the one that exists next to our own. \"\n\nI pinched myselt to see it I was real, and seemed to be as solid as could be, given my state of excitation and ebullience upon realizing where I was.\n\n\"We are in another b r a i d of the universe,\" Emilito explained. \u201cThe one overlapping with the world of every day life; made up of the same energy only slightly different. Now you know what it means to become invisible, and what it is like to be stalking with the double.\u201d\u201d\n\n=======\n\nFrom the last three pages of the original scanned version of that manuscript:\n\n\u201cI woke up gradually becoming solid again. I was laying in my bed in Zuleica's house, numb and disoriented. And t h e n 1 remembered b i t s and pieces ot a giant mosaic. I knew that another world existed, a world that was as real as the one I had learned to call my own. I knew that I was nothing. That whatever I thought I was, is a fabrica- tion, a temporary consolidation ot components held together by a force for some ettect. but it could never be taken for real. There was another reality, parallel to our own, and it too wasn't real. The position ot our assemblage points was everything. It amalgamated worlds upon worlds and enabled us to experience them as our world, as the world.\n\nThe world ot everyday life was only one perceptual possibility out ot an infinite number of possibility that make up existence. The stalkers training is to be tluid, invisible without attachment to self and things, so that one could shift back and torch at ease without losing energy or getting lost.\n\nLiving in the world ot everyday life was Like being a student in a class. I had to give a good presentation, I had to appear that I knew what I was talking about, that I meant what I said. I needed to strive for order and coherence. Hut when the class was over, whatever was said meant nothing, it was only an orderly structure created tor that moment and not meant to ever be taken seriously as something real or believable. It was an exercise which had to be discarded when the need was over so that one could move on in a never ending journey.\n\nSo it was with the twin reality. It was made up of people and animals and vegetation just like our world, only ditterent. The grove of trees in Clara's house, the tree house, Emilito and myself a l l had been part ot the twin world.

I knew also that it that was so, then I, too, was in my dreaming body and so was everyone in the room and that was why they seemed so sparkling. What&amp;#39;s more, the house, the bench, the tables, the food that had been set out in the patio, a l l were part of another world. I had crossed over into the twin world without even realizing it. And that meant that the discoveries that everyone had been sharing, were not about some inaccessible distant dream world, but about the very reality which we were now inhabiting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The minute I realized this, Emilito said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s right&amp;#39; Taisha. I am the other side ot Zuleica, and you are your dream body, the other side of yourself. You have used the energetic wave trom the universe to cross over to the parallel world, the one that exists next to our own. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pinched myselt to see it I was real, and seemed to be as solid as could be, given my state of excitation and ebullience upon realizing where I was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are in another b r a i d of the universe,&amp;quot; Emilito explained. \u201cThe one overlapping with the world of every day life; made up of the same energy only slightly different. Now you know what it means to become invisible, and what it is like to be stalking with the double.\u201d\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the last three pages of the original scanned version of that manuscript:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI woke up gradually becoming solid again. I was laying in my bed in Zuleica&amp;#39;s house, numb and disoriented. And t h e n 1 remembered b i t s and pieces ot a giant mosaic. I knew that another world existed, a world that was as real as the one I had learned to call my own. I knew that I was nothing. That whatever I thought I was, is a fabrica- tion, a temporary consolidation ot components held together by a force for some ettect. but it could never be taken for real. There was another reality, parallel to our own, and it too wasn&amp;#39;t real. The position ot our assemblage points was everything. It amalgamated worlds upon worlds and enabled us to experience them as our world, as the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world ot everyday life was only one perceptual possibility out ot an infinite number of possibility that make up existence. The stalkers training is to be tluid, invisible without attachment to self and things, so that one could shift back and torch at ease without losing energy or getting lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Living in the world ot everyday life was Like being a student in a class. I had to give a good presentation, I had to appear that I knew what I was talking about, that I meant what I said. I needed to strive for order and coherence. Hut when the class was over, whatever was said meant nothing, it was only an orderly structure created tor that moment and not meant to ever be taken seriously as something real or believable. It was an exercise which had to be discarded when the need was over so that one could move on in a never ending journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it was with the twin reality. It was made up of people and animals and vegetation just like our world, only ditterent. The grove of trees in Clara&amp;#39;s house, the tree house, Emilito and myself a l l had been part ot the twin world. I realized I had spent entire stretches ot time there without even knowing it. I had been able to enter it under the power of don Juan and his group of sorcerers who trained me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He and his group ot sorcerers througti a lifetime of training had scored enough energy to cross back and forth without losing their awareness, their control aad sobriety.

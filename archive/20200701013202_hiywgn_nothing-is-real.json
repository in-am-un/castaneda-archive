They even made a lot of progress.  Then quit.\n\nMostly, they were sucked back into the agricultural myth of close families, partly urged by the religions that produces.\n\nAnd by sex drive of course.\n\nBut sex loses most of its appeal, once you realize that path is not a happy one.\n\nI suspect Carlos had the same problem with losing students.\n\nHe'd been hanging out with individuals for much longer than the workshops.\n\nMaybe at least 15 years earlier, and his loose association with Marshall Ho'o's association ought to have put him into contact with even more.\n\nAll I heard about it was, a place they used to practice at was in or near Santa Monica, and it didn't work out.\n\nAnd, \"Don't let your daughter hang out with Carlos. He's got a new woman on his arm each time you see him!\"\n\nCould be, Marshall Ho'o had at least one hot daughter.\n\nBut Carlos probably discovered one thing.\n\nMen are nuts, and looking for the biggest nut cracker. They're just as likely to turn around and attack, as say thank you.\n\nAnd their chances of going Ken Eagle Feather on you, are far greater than with women.\n\nFor anyone who's not familiar, Ken said don Juan rejected Carlos, so now you should follow Ken instead.\n\nFelix has done nearly the same thing.  Carlos put all that work into him, and now he uses it to spread doubt, so he can peel off a few naive students.\n\nWomen on the other hand,  are looking for somewhere to belong.  They're the easiest to enlist.\n\nJust give them a place to stay, where they feel they're working towards a wonderful goal!\n\n(Except Cholita.  That doesn't work with her.)\n\nThey're easy to enlist, but rarely do you find a woman who's self-motivating for something as vague as sorcery.\n\nYou have to tie that into their world, in some way that makes it natural for  them to work harder.\n\nBut unfortunately, women also want to know the attractiveness pecking order.\n\nCholita's given me an ear full of those goings on in classes.  I'm rather oblivious to such things.\n\nBoth men and women have some difficult tendencies if you try to teach them personally.\n\nI guess Tensegrity workshops is what Carlos came up with, because he'd been running around with martial arts practicing women for a while.  The witches were at a UC System Shotokan tournament back in the 70s.  Already black belt too, which takes at least 5 years in that system.\n\nThat sort of verifies they were around when don Juan was around, and hovering around Carlos in the late 60s.\n\nI heard some of the men at the tournament making fun of them. \"Women have to do Bo Katas, because they can't fight.\"\n\nMaybe, but that never stops Cholita from kicking my ass.\n\nI suppose Carlos ultimately decided to go for students in bulk, and try to get a couple of successes out of hundreds.\n\nWhich is why I say once in a while, Cleargreen is the official teaching arm. Carlos set it up.\n\nNo one can break that bond. It's our link to his *intent*.\n\nCarlos even left a warning.  He told Ellis that La Gorda tried to take over the little sisters and the Genaros, and dropped dead.\n\nWe don't want to mess with *intent*.  That's got to be the closest thing to God, for sorcerers.\n\nAlso, no *intent*, no spectacular gifts along the way, to point  you in the right direction.\n\nAnyone who follows an Eagle Feather type is going to get stuck in some other pathetic intent, such as to be a  wise guru.\n\nBeing a guru doesn't do you any good, once you get in the tunnel that has furrows.\n\nThe tunnel I was led to by that Gremlin thing.\n\nCarlos told us about it in class.\n\nEach furrow is a different you, and none of them know what a guru is.\n\nPlus to get there, you have to give up that kind of \"wise guru\" thinking.  As you can see in my simulation, an angry witch can enter, but a wise Guru won't even notice it's available.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/06lsputvgc651.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=091aa1d3af6614e9da4e43819b21998637c62e77](https://preview.redd.it/06lsputvgc651.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=091aa1d3af6614e9da4e43819b21998637c62e77)\n\nIf the workshops Carlos settled on don't work, then I supposed there will just be people from those who made it work at least a little, and whoever they try to help after that.\n\nBut if it does work out, then we can map things better.\n\nMeaning, figure out what works best for different types of people, so that the workshops produce amazing results and more people become interested.\n\nAnd maybe come up with satisfying answers to questions like in this post.\n\nHere's something new I've learned from the efforts of people in here.\n\nMy goal is to get you guys to scoop up a ball of light with a face on it.\n\nBut I forgot that I was viewing faces in darkness for months before I scooped one up.\n\nDo some automatically see face after face at first?\n\nApparently that's so!\n\nAlso, there's no reason to have to see a woman's face.\n\nYou might see a little dog.\n\nMaybe men see women's faces, women see pet faces?\n\nI also learned, corpses aren't as scary to some, as they must have been to me when Fairy first showed up.\n\nEventually we could make a little flow chart, and people could find their current place on it, follow the yes/no junctions to figure out what might work next for them best, all based on what happened before with dozens of other people.\n\nI'm not sure where the fear and doubts come from while learning.\n\nIf something frightens you during practice, the next time it'll frighten you less, and after a dozen times you'll be welcoming it to do it's worst, like an old friend.\n\nFright moves the assemblage point!\n\nAnd doubts go away if you actually work hard.\n\nSo I don't get either.\n\nIf fear stops someone, I have to suspect it's the internal dialogue trying to put  a stop to any attempts to escape this position of the assemblage point.\n\nIt feels like \"a reason\", but it's just the internal dialogue in disguise.\n\nRemember, that internal dialogue is what holds us here.\n\nIt's not just a little buddy to keep you company.\n\nIt's a prison guard.\n\nLikewise, religious worries are also the internal dialogue, perhaps at a deeper level, just below the dialogue itself.\n\nBeliefs. That's what they are.  But beliefs are tied to the position of the assemblage point.\n\nAs an example, a demon  shows up in your darkened room, and you're not unhappy to see it.\n\nHe's a friend.\n\nA life long catholic might still feel an urge to cross themselves and say 10 prayers to Mary, to make themselves feel ok about not running from demons.\n\nThey'd almost be forced to say the prayers, as if they felt so guilty it was the only way to relieve their worries.\n\nLater on, no.  Doesn't happen.\n\nYou realize, it was just the internal dialogue.

It pushes your energy body away, because your energy body doesn&amp;#39;t want any part of that pointless suffering&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And eventually you can then drop self-pity directly, without all the jumping up and down and waving your hands (as Cholita likes to describe it when she&amp;#39;s making fun of my pictures).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a huge difference between dealing with it at that level of &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, and dealing with it in our normal state of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have to be careful that we don&amp;#39;t become &amp;quot;born again Christian&amp;quot; types.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proclaiming our eyes were closed, but &amp;quot;Now we can see!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, Carlos, Taisha, and Florinda all believed that modifying your normal behavior would help you learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it didn&amp;#39;t.

In my case, I changed my horrible demon into a pretty Fairy, and we share her in this subreddit. She was a gift from Carlos himself (in scary form).\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=415bd8182c8ffc50c1caa5ba586d36d54c89b537](https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=415bd8182c8ffc50c1caa5ba586d36d54c89b537)\n\n\\&gt;The sparks of light began to happen directly in front of me sometimes.\n\nThe blue one is called, \"the blue pearl\" in yoga systems, and it's not an uncommon sight if the assemblage point shifts even a tiny bit down that J curve (railroad tracks) in the picture.  We're all trapped at the upper right, trying to learn to  move it down.\n\nThe Olmecs discovered that 8000 years ago, before money was invented. It took thousands of sorcerers, thousands of years, to figure out what's going on.  No  other system even has a clue. They just play with the effects of the \"assemblage point\" moving, without knowing that's what's going on.\n\nTheir goal is your money, so they have no reason to look further.\n\nEverything after money was invented around 6000 years ago, is designed only to steal using those \"green station\" effects to trick people into believing it's a real \"path\" to something more.  Mixed with some religious delusions, they can completely brainwash the populations of entire countries. Then once everyone believes the nonsense, everyone in that system says, \"how can everyone be wrong?\"\n\nBut in fact, everyone is wrong.  We're all trapped in a prison for our awareness.\n\nWasn't always so.  Mankind is 300,000 years old.\n\nThe shit only came about starting around 10,000 years ago, after language was invented 40,000 years earlier, and humans began to join efforts and create technology.\n\nTech is wonderful!  But it's not good for learning sorcery, a much higher form of technology.\n\nSorcerers escape that \"Blue Station\" on the J curve, travel past the green,  and go exploring outside the \"system\".  \n\nI asked my eye doctor about the dots too, and he said it was probably a neuron in the eye structure dying.\n\nThat's how primitive our \"knowledge\" is these days!\n\nHis \"neuron dying\" explanation doesn't account for why once you reach the Orange station on that map,  you can wave your arm in the air and generate dozens of those dots, in various colors.\n\nSo your problem now is giving up on pretending (which other systems do 100%) and overcoming laziness to learn to move your assemblage point on purpose.\n\nIf you what you want is your own little throne to sit on so you can collect money from others based on your saintliness, then you'll never be able to learn sorcery.\n\nYou have to want to learn it, just because you do. And don't care if anyone else ever even knows about it.\n\nYou have to become a \"magic nerd\".\n\nThen you have to find 2 hours a day to practice.\n\nOnly 1 in 100 who comes here can manage that.\n\nIt's why magic has nearly left our world.  It takes actual work to learn.\n\nPretending, in order to get human attention like they do in meditation systems, is far easier than actually working to learn something that gets scarier and scarier as you go along.\n\n\"Real\" is often very scary.\n\nThat's the first enemy to overcome, if you actually put in some work to learn to be silent in your mind.\n\nMeditation did NOT get you silent.\n\nIt was just a substitute internal dialogue.\n\nShamanic drumming could do the same.\n\nAnd any woman kicks butt over meditation gurus.  She just doesn't have any male \"endorsement\" to make that widely known.\n\nExcept in here.", "edited": 1680445872.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jenrkie", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;There was clearly a giant spider running on the ground of my parent\u2019s dimly lit room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cool!

She was a gift from Carlos himself (in scary form).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;v=enabled&amp;amp;s=415bd8182c8ffc50c1caa5ba586d36d54c89b537\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;v=enabled&amp;amp;s=415bd8182c8ffc50c1caa5ba586d36d54c89b537&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;The sparks of light began to happen directly in front of me sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The blue one is called, &amp;quot;the blue pearl&amp;quot; in yoga systems, and it&amp;#39;s not an uncommon sight if the assemblage point shifts even a tiny bit down that J curve (railroad tracks) in the picture.  We&amp;#39;re all trapped at the upper right, trying to learn to  move it down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Olmecs discovered that 8000 years ago, before money was invented. It took thousands of sorcerers, thousands of years, to figure out what&amp;#39;s going on.  No  other system even has a clue. They just play with the effects of the &amp;quot;assemblage point&amp;quot; moving, without knowing that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their goal is your money, so they have no reason to look further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything after money was invented around 6000 years ago, is designed only to steal using those &amp;quot;green station&amp;quot; effects to trick people into believing it&amp;#39;s a real &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; to something more.  Mixed with some religious delusions, they can completely brainwash the populations of entire countries. Then once everyone believes the nonsense, everyone in that system says, &amp;quot;how can everyone be wrong?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, everyone is wrong.  We&amp;#39;re all trapped in a prison for our awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;#39;t always so.  Mankind is 300,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The shit only came about starting around 10,000 years ago, after language was invented 40,000 years earlier, and humans began to join efforts and create technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tech is wonderful!  But it&amp;#39;s not good for learning sorcery, a much higher form of technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers escape that &amp;quot;Blue Station&amp;quot; on the J curve, travel past the green,  and go exploring outside the &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked my eye doctor about the dots too, and he said it was probably a neuron in the eye structure dying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how primitive our &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; is these days!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His &amp;quot;neuron dying&amp;quot; explanation doesn&amp;#39;t account for why once you reach the Orange station on that map,  you can wave your arm in the air and generate dozens of those dots, in various colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So your problem now is giving up on pretending (which other systems do 100%) and overcoming laziness to learn to move your assemblage point on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you what you want is your own little throne to sit on so you can collect money from others based on your saintliness, then you&amp;#39;ll never be able to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to want to learn it, just because you do. And don&amp;#39;t care if anyone else ever even knows about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to become a &amp;quot;magic nerd&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you have to find 2 hours a day to practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only 1 in 100 who comes here can manage that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why magic has nearly left our world.  It takes actual work to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretending, in order to get human attention like they do in meditation systems, is far easier than actually working to learn something that gets scarier and scarier as you go along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Real&amp;quot; is often very scary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the first enemy to overcome, if you actually put in some work to learn to be silent in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meditation did NOT get you silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was just a substitute internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shamanic drumming could do the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And any woman kicks butt over meditation gurus.  She just doesn&amp;#39;t have any male &amp;quot;endorsement&amp;quot; to make that widely known.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null,

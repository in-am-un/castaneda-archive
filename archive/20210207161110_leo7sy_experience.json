Completely different entities, and also personalities.\n\nFairy is safe.  Tested by the lineage.\n\nFancy probably scared me in the form of a demon, as a 5 year old child.  Except, I got to like the dark energy fright feeling, and would summon her by \"feeling\" that myself.\n\nI still hid under the blankets, but I wanted her to come so I could feel the electricity.  It moved my assemblage point, and I had dream visions from it.\n\nFairy will show up when you are capable of perceiving inorganic beings.\n\nI do believe she promised that, however it's hard to understand what they have in mind at times.\n\nShe might only have meant, she belonged to the lineage, and would like to belong to another, in whatever form.\n\nSo staying around Juan also makes sense.  But if you do her locator spell, maybe she'll feel guilty and show up to give you dark energy for a while.\n\nWhen that happens varies by person.  If you could shift your assemblage point down to the bottom, I have no doubt she'd show up.\n\nBut doing that takes dark energy. It's a catch 22.  You need dark energy to move it there, but you can't get dark energy until you succeed.\n\nFortunately, \"stuff leaks out\", which is probably why we can find the puffs of color, when we can barely move our assemblage points.\n\nIf you want to summon her,  or find your own, play with the puffs of color.\n\nThe best thing you can find to do that, is \"scrolling puffs\".\n\nThat's when you see a very clear purple puff in the air, and when you examine it with your eyes, it \"scrolls\".\n\nNow, forget about directionality versus non-directionality.  Yes, non-directionality is  responsible for the scrolling.\n\nBut forgetting that, as you look at the puff and it finally scrolls out of view, another should come in from where that one came in.\n\nOn the scrolling puffs, you will find inorganic beings.\n\nSome see Fairy \"visiting\" on the side, but can't bring her to the front.\n\nThe puffs can scroll many ways.  Mystery showed me a different way last night, but I wasn't interested in scrolling puffs.  Mystery's stuff tends to be sort of academic.  Less practical.  More wizard than witch.\n\nIf you see an IOB, and even if you aren't fully sure, pay close attention to your dreams that night. She might have failed to appear convincingly, and is trying to supply you with enough dark energy to see her in the dark room.\n\nAt first, you'll believe IOBs are a figment of your imagination.  Coming only from you.\n\nBut you'll be so hypnotized by what they do, you won't care.\n\nLater you'll find out, they are not.\n\nAnd they have very long memories.\n\nThey seem like only your imagination at first, because they don't obey the social graces.\n\nThey don't make little motions with their facial muscles, to show they are understanding and agreeing, or disagreeing with you.\n\nThey don't chit-chat.\n\nNone of what we normally associate with an interaction with a real, live being, are present.\n\nUntil...\n\nThey decide to transform into a beautiful angel, and dance around you.\n\n(Fancy's latest trick.)\n\nSo give them a break when it comes to doubt, and remember.  They try to do anything you ask.\n\nEven if it takes months to do it.\n\nBe careful what you ask!  I told Fairy to guard Cholita, and lost most contact with her from that point on.\n\nBut IOBs are plentiful.  I found more.  Some I just ignored, because I have too many now.\n\n2 seems ideal, because they are somewhat competitive.\n\nFor example, if Fancy disappoints me, I have Mystery around and can play with him.\n\nFancy notices that I didn't care, and that's not the kind of interaction she likes.\n\nShe want's more emotion.\n\nAnd disappointing you is emotional interaction. They have no sense about such things. They'll scare you, or love you, and both are equal to them.\n\nSo having 2 means, they can't afford to just disappoint you all the time.\n\nIt's like having 2 little nieces, who are obsessed with getting your attention.\n\nIf you have one alone, they start to play tricks, like not doing what you want so you have to convince them.\n\nBut if the other niece sees that, she'll come do what you want, stealing the attention (energy for the IOBs).\n\nThat forces the stubborn one to do a spectacular trick, to get your attention back.\n\nThus, it's better to have at least 2 allies.\n\nLet me propose what happens if you have 3.\n\nIt's the same as with dogs.\n\nIf you have 2 dogs, they are obsessed with you.\n\nBut once you get 3, they start to behave like a pack of dogs.\n\nYou get less attention.\n\nVicente had 3, and look at the pack animal behavior Carlos encountered, when he put those plants in the ground.\n\nAll of the old sorcerers at the rock, waiting to frighten passers by, had 3.\n\nBecause the old sorcerers liked that pack behavior.\n\nStick with 2?\n\nLast night Fancy showed me how to grab the copy of our house, in which Cholita likes to play with Minx, and \"pull\" it over into my room.  Like stretching the sheets and bedspread, to cover the bed perfectly.\n\nShe claimed, I could add a room to the house myself, and then do darkroom gazing in the phantom copy of the house.\n\nIn fact, she also claimed that's how sorcerers discovered that you can build a little village, one object at a time.\n\nYou just notice it's possible at some point.\n\nI even got down on the floor to stretch the rest of the house into my room, gazing under the bed to see if Mystery was down there like he used to be. I'm old, going down to the floor is not something I do often, so I always take a look for monsters under the bed.\n\nHe wasn't there, but the new room addition was foaming and bubbling under the bed, like a really course fog.\n\nI stood up, turned around, and Mystery was there floating above me.\n\nThat's how you summon them.  You just look for them. There's no Shakespearean chant that brings them out.\n\nThey come when you look for them.\n\nWhen I turned back from Mystery, to look towards the rest of the house,  I could see that the dark room was now filled with white light.\n\nCholita stuck her head through the door, and tried to enter the new room addition.\n\nShe broke into pieces and vanished.\n\nI suppose, I didn't do a very good job.

Completely different entities, and also personalities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy is safe.  Tested by the lineage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy probably scared me in the form of a demon, as a 5 year old child.  Except, I got to like the dark energy fright feeling, and would summon her by &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; that myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still hid under the blankets, but I wanted her to come so I could feel the electricity.  It moved my assemblage point, and I had dream visions from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fairy will show up when you are capable of perceiving inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do believe she promised that, however it&amp;#39;s hard to understand what they have in mind at times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She might only have meant, she belonged to the lineage, and would like to belong to another, in whatever form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So staying around Juan also makes sense.  But if you do her locator spell, maybe she&amp;#39;ll feel guilty and show up to give you dark energy for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When that happens varies by person.  If you could shift your assemblage point down to the bottom, I have no doubt she&amp;#39;d show up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But doing that takes dark energy. It&amp;#39;s a catch 22.  You need dark energy to move it there, but you can&amp;#39;t get dark energy until you succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, &amp;quot;stuff leaks out&amp;quot;, which is probably why we can find the puffs of color, when we can barely move our assemblage points.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to summon her,  or find your own, play with the puffs of color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can find to do that, is &amp;quot;scrolling puffs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when you see a very clear purple puff in the air, and when you examine it with your eyes, it &amp;quot;scrolls&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, forget about directionality versus non-directionality.  Yes, non-directionality is  responsible for the scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But forgetting that, as you look at the puff and it finally scrolls out of view, another should come in from where that one came in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the scrolling puffs, you will find inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some see Fairy &amp;quot;visiting&amp;quot; on the side, but can&amp;#39;t bring her to the front.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The puffs can scroll many ways.  Mystery showed me a different way last night, but I wasn&amp;#39;t interested in scrolling puffs.  Mystery&amp;#39;s stuff tends to be sort of academic.  Less practical.  More wizard than witch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you see an IOB, and even if you aren&amp;#39;t fully sure, pay close attention to your dreams that night. She might have failed to appear convincingly, and is trying to supply you with enough dark energy to see her in the dark room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, you&amp;#39;ll believe IOBs are a figment of your imagination.  Coming only from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;ll be so hypnotized by what they do, you won&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later you&amp;#39;ll find out, they are not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they have very long memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They seem like only your imagination at first, because they don&amp;#39;t obey the social graces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t make little motions with their facial muscles, to show they are understanding and agreeing, or disagreeing with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t chit-chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of what we normally associate with an interaction with a real, live being, are present.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They decide to transform into a beautiful angel, and dance around you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Fancy&amp;#39;s latest trick.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So give them a break when it comes to doubt, and remember.  They try to do anything you ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if it takes months to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be careful what you ask!  I told Fairy to guard Cholita, and lost most contact with her from that point on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But IOBs are plentiful.  I found more.  Some I just ignored, because I have too many now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 seems ideal, because they are somewhat competitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, if Fancy disappoints me, I have Mystery around and can play with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy notices that I didn&amp;#39;t care, and that&amp;#39;s not the kind of interaction she likes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She want&amp;#39;s more emotion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And disappointing you is emotional interaction. They have no sense about such things. They&amp;#39;ll scare you, or love you, and both are equal to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So having 2 means, they can&amp;#39;t afford to just disappoint you all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like having 2 little nieces, who are obsessed with getting your attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have one alone, they start to play tricks, like not doing what you want so you have to convince them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if the other niece sees that, she&amp;#39;ll come do what you want, stealing the attention (energy for the IOBs).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That forces the stubborn one to do a spectacular trick, to get your attention back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, it&amp;#39;s better to have at least 2 allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me propose what happens if you have 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same as with dogs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have 2 dogs, they are obsessed with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you get 3, they start to behave like a pack of dogs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get less attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vicente had 3, and look at the pack animal behavior Carlos encountered, when he put those plants in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the old sorcerers at the rock, waiting to frighten passers by, had 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the old sorcerers liked that pack behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stick with 2?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night Fancy showed me how to grab the copy of our house, in which Cholita likes to play with Minx, and &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; it over into my room.  Like stretching the sheets and bedspread, to cover the bed perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She claimed, I could add a room to the house myself, and then do darkroom gazing in the phantom copy of the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, she also claimed that&amp;#39;s how sorcerers discovered that you can build a little village, one object at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just notice it&amp;#39;s possible at some point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I even got down on the floor to stretch the rest of the house into my room, gazing under the bed to see if Mystery was down there like he used to be. I&amp;#39;m old, going down to the floor is not something I do often, so I always take a look for monsters under the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wasn&amp;#39;t there, but the new room addition was foaming and bubbling under the bed, like a really course fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stood up, turned around, and Mystery was there floating above me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how you summon them.  You just look for them. There&amp;#39;s no Shakespearean chant that brings them out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They come when you look for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I turned back from Mystery, to look towards the rest of the house,  I could see that the dark room was now filled with white light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita stuck her head through the door, and tried to enter the new room addition.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She broke into pieces and vanished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose, I didn&amp;#39;t do a very good job. She took a look at the construction site, and decided it was too dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what inorganic beings can do for you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if you want to see how screwed up the Castaneda world is, go discuss IOBs in another place, like that giant Facebook community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll get warnings from clueless people, who are making up their talents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same happens  in the meditation community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What they can&amp;#39;t do, they claim should not be done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; 2.You don&amp;#39;t know where we live&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had that concern also.

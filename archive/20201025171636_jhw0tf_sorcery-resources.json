I suppose we have McDonald's now and don't need some of the old sorcerer stuff.\n\nI'm going to go put a pot of hot chocolate on the stove, in honor of their food choices. They invented chocolate.  But the cannibalism was probably a dead end food genre.\n\nBesides, they were obsessed with controlling other people.  No internet where they lived, so they became super obsessed with people.\n\nA lot like most of the angry men in the Castaneda community.  They behave like the old sorcerers in their obsession with other people, instead of knowledge for its own sake.\n\nImagine coming to this subreddit, pretending to be an expert on Castaneda, and then not literally peeing your pants, when you see what people are doing these days.\n\nInstead, you attack!\n\nOld sorcerers suck.\n\nBut the bottom line here is, resources are good.\n\nA dark room.  Maybe some stones or crystals, or even a silence stick to rest your head on.\n\nA big old armchair, comfortable, safe because the arms keep you from falling sideways, and even able to lean back a bit, when you want to go into lucid dreaming.  Did you know those chairs can be used for remote viewing?  The kind even the CIA would be jealous of?\n\nEven a coffee table can become a resource, if you have it set up where no one will bother you.\n\nYou find one the right height, then you sit cross legged a little ways from it, and lean your chin down onto the edge, so that the table presses up under the chin, towards the tongue.\n\nWhy would  you do that?\n\nFor starters, it brings he head closer to the ankles, which helps activate the second attention.\n\nAnd it helps with trying to get silent.   Given closer proximity to the energy at the ankles, and the intent to get silent, you have a little power going for you.\n\nOr maybe it pisses off the tongue because your chin hurts and it's hard to swallow, so you don't feel like jabbering in your head as much?\n\nAfter all, the stones and crystals basically hurt. That's why they help you get silent.\n\nYou can also pinch the hell out of the side of your ribcage, near the armpits.  Cross the arms to do it, and pinch as hard as you can! If it doesn't hurt like hell the first time, you didn't do it right.\n\nThe point is, it will actually send a shiver up your spine at first.\n\nIt goes all the way to the top of the head. It moves the assemblage point!\n\nLater, not so much...  And unless you are slim, you will have a hard time finding the right spot.\n\nPutting sharp rocks under your butt, the way Zuleica had them do, is also a use of pain to help with silence.\n\nEven Ray in a recent Star Wars, had sharp little rocks under her hand before she got silent. It's that Faction H at work!\n\nI don't know for sure why the coffee table works, but Carlos often encouraged us to created sorcery resources for ourselves, so that it was easier for us to practice.\n\nOnce you have them around your house, they remind you it's potentially practice time, whenever you pass that area.\n\nAnd although Carlos made fun of my recapitulation crate (see Nagualist newsletter),  to let me know he DID NOT LIKE that publication,   he took note of the fact that I spent hours a day in there.\n\nI think it was just the idea that you couldn't start until you built a crate, that bothered him.  Any excuse not to practice!\n\nYou wouldn't believe the excuses I've heard, for not doing any work.  \"Let me start that when I get my new vitamins. They should arrive in a  couple of weeks.  Then I'll be ready to learn to get silent!\"\n\nSo if you're new to this, and aren't visited by terrible demons at night, constantly threatening to eat you alive (how fun!), then get yourself some resources instead.\n\nFind a closet to recap in.\n\nMake a silence stick. 1\" pole, 2 feet long (3 if you aren't flexible enough) padded bundle rubber banded to one end.  Lean into it, with the forehead on the pad.  Again, head is now closer to ankles, while forcing silence.\n\nYou could say it's a \"cobweb hookup\".\n\nIf you don't believe in the cobwebs, some day you will!  A time will come when you reach out, and for that day only, they are everywhere!\n\nOr get some stones at the river, which fit between your fingers.\n\nFind a place where you can put a hammock, or make it easy to climb up a tree and gaze at the stars.\n\nGet a dark room where you can actually walk around, even if it's just an old kid's \"fort\".\n\nFind a bunch of old cushions you can stack in a corner, to do what kids who don't have \"forts\" do.  Each time you see a neighbor put out an old chair or couch near the trash, hoping someone else wants it, steal the cushions! Leave the couch.\n\nThere's more to acquiring \"resources\" than meets the eye. It's possible you could even get *intent* on your side, for providing resources.\n\nLater, if you work hard, you'll have other resources.\n\nSuch as power spots and transdimensional portals.\n\nBut until then, a dark place is a big start.\n\nCholita and I have 2 transdimensional portals, and 3 power spots.\n\nThey just sort of evolve as you practice sorcery.\n\nExcept of course, Cholita holds out on me.  She has more.  There's a portal in her garage she-shed studio.\n\nBut I'm not allowed in there.\n\nToo bad the washing machines are also in there.

My head was tilted back resting on a thick pole, and instead of looking inside from the car, I was looking at some giant trees in front of the house from Clara.  I was practicing an observation exercise that Emilito had taught.  And she was sitting on that special bench that he had built according to the specifications of the ancient wizards.\n\n This particular observation bench was specifically designedmind to observe the trees.  The three posts that supported the part back of the bench were approximately six inches square and six inches taller than the top horizontal plank that served like back of the bench.  The tops of the posts are cut tilted so that, when sitting on the bench, you could head back against one of the three vertical posts that stuck out.

And Cholita helped out by slamming a few doors when needed.\n\nAfter playing with Fancy (who gave me more notes for the cellphone), I found my \"mud people\". \n\nOne stuck to my little finger, and I couldn't shake him off.\n\nSince those guys only show up on the north wall of my room, I remained near there sitting on pillows.\n\nI pushed and pulled on them a while, hoping to activate some poltergeist activity.\n\nThen *intent* came to visit.  Like a being.   I suppose, like IOBs are to some shamans, such as Maria or Rosy.  They only feel the presence, they can't actually see them.  And yet, they intuit what they look like.\n\nIntent was female???  That's what it felt like.\n\nAt any rate, something came to visit.\n\nI could think about anything and turn my head, and I zipped of into a different part of the haunted house.\n\nExcept when I got back, I couldn't recall any of it.\n\nOne time I started to zip, and intent told me not to go that way, to go to the right instead.\n\nI got to thinking, \"Man, I have to tell Juan about this.\"  I made some mental instructions, which now seem completely pointless.  \n\nBut here they are anyway:  When you were a kid, you could shake your head so little that no one could see, let the eyes gently slip left and right without focusing the gaze,  and in that way force (or allow) yourself to see anything at all.  \n\nYou couldn't select what, but you could cause your sight to be flooded with things you weren't supposed to allow.\n\nDo that, and intent comes to visit.  And then you can explore the haunted house freely.\n\nFinally I just stayed in one of the other rooms of the house, and it became more lucid and controllable. Zipping into a different room is one thing, but you have to stay a while to stabilize that position of the assemblage point, if you want to explore it.\n\nAfter discovering that Cholita had added rooms to our house and not told me about them,   including a \"husband and children\" to go with them,  I leaped out the window and ended up in a big pit filled with mud.  \n\nClueless that there were people there in the mud.  \n\nMud people.\n\nDidn't realize that at the time.\n\nI asked one of the men if standing on the mud was not a good idea, because you could sink in.\n\nHe replied, \"We spray it horizontally as layers  to make it stronger.\"\n\nDid I mention, I never went to sleep.

And Cholita helped out by slamming a few doors when needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After playing with Fancy (who gave me more notes for the cellphone), I found my &amp;quot;mud people&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One stuck to my little finger, and I couldn&amp;#39;t shake him off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since those guys only show up on the north wall of my room, I remained near there sitting on pillows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pushed and pulled on them a while, hoping to activate some poltergeist activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; came to visit.  Like a being.   I suppose, like IOBs are to some shamans, such as Maria or Rosy.  They only feel the presence, they can&amp;#39;t actually see them.  And yet, they intuit what they look like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intent was female???  That&amp;#39;s what it felt like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At any rate, something came to visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could think about anything and turn my head, and I zipped of into a different part of the haunted house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except when I got back, I couldn&amp;#39;t recall any of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One time I started to zip, and intent told me not to go that way, to go to the right instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got to thinking, &amp;quot;Man, I have to tell Juan about this.&amp;quot;  I made some mental instructions, which now seem completely pointless.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here they are anyway:  When you were a kid, you could shake your head so little that no one could see, let the eyes gently slip left and right without focusing the gaze,  and in that way force (or allow) yourself to see anything at all.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You couldn&amp;#39;t select what, but you could cause your sight to be flooded with things you weren&amp;#39;t supposed to allow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do that, and intent comes to visit.  And then you can explore the haunted house freely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally I just stayed in one of the other rooms of the house, and it became more lucid and controllable. Zipping into a different room is one thing, but you have to stay a while to stabilize that position of the assemblage point, if you want to explore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After discovering that Cholita had added rooms to our house and not told me about them,   including a &amp;quot;husband and children&amp;quot; to go with them,  I leaped out the window and ended up in a big pit filled with mud.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clueless that there were people there in the mud.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mud people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t realize that at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked one of the men if standing on the mud was not a good idea, because you could sink in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He replied, &amp;quot;We spray it horizontally as layers  to make it stronger.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did I mention, I never went to sleep.  That was awake with eyes open. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just in case a newbie is reading this and misunderstands it to be dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s waking dreaming.

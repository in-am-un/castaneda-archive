I could visit without needing access from her.\n\nAs I was getting ready to jump, I smelled wet dog.\n\nI realized, a cage had materialized right to my left, the entrance of the cage nearly touching my left knee.\n\nI tried to recall how it got there, but I was in \"Silent Knowledge\" mode, so everything was both ghostlike, and impossible to remember longer than a few seconds.\n\nWho put that here and why?\n\nI notice it had a mechanism for both drink and food, and was big enough for a large dog.\n\nOr a  human.\n\nI wondered if it had anything to do with Pleiades.\n\nI glance that direction, and saw Lily doing tricks.\n\nShe was floating left and right, blocking my direction to Pleiades, but doing it with a smile, and different costume and hair changes.\n\nIt was so fun to watch, I decided to give her some energy.\n\nAs I was doing that, I must have picked up some of her dark energy, because I had a cold chill go up my spine.\n\nI realized, the fliers are inorganic beings.\n\nIt's possible they can trap humans in their world if they want to.\n\nAnd I don't qualify to be able to escape them yet.\n\nYou have to be able to switch over to your double, from the tonal, on purpose, before you are out of the reach of inorganic beings.\n\nThey don't need to trap your organic matter.\n\nJust your double.\n\nMaybe Lily was warning me.\n\nSo I drew this up today.\n\nDon't neglect learning to switch to your double!\n\nWe have all we need.\n\nCarlos gave it to us.\n\nIt's not exactly as Zuleica used on Carlos, but it's not like she used on Taisha either.\n\nAnd yet, I was certain last night, in Silent Knowledge, that Carlos gave us everything. We just haven't noticed yet.\n\nAnd that Zuleica's pass was one method to complete what Zuleica taught Carlos.\n\nTo switch.\n\nIn our case, we might better switch by learning to visibly see our double.\n\nOver and over.\n\nThe Tensegrity is oriented that way.\n\nAnd Zuleica's pass includes a movement for sweeping the floor with a tentacle.\n\nThat's how you move beyond the grasp of inorganic beings.\n\nSo don't neglect looking at your energy body from time to time.\n\nIf you can't see it, you didn't get solidly enough into the red zone, to stuff  brilliant puffs of color on your torso.\n\nIt's true that you can blow through the red zone, on the way to the orange, and not do a very good job of playing with the puffs.\n\nBut try not to do that.\n\nThink of it this way.\n\nThe green zone puts you into the right mindset.  And gives you some bliss, so you can feel happy and optimistic in the red zone.\n\nIt lets you catch a glimpse of the puffs, so you can start to gaze at those, to get more silent.\n\nThe red zone is where the action is.\n\nBUILD THAT ENERGY BODY!\n\nDon't leave the red zone, until there's no more puffs to scoop up.\n\nAs you can see with your eyes.\n\nLook around, especially at the height in that tensegrity pass.

If Taisha had seen what's in here, and arranged it to make it's way over, I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nBefore the book came along, if I was too tired to sit up and practice, I did Fancy's pass in my mind at the spot in the room I usually did it.\n\nDON'T over look that you burn intent holes in your dark room.  Places remember what you were doing.\n\nI can literally wave my hand over the last place Little Smoke appeared, and get a minor re-run of it.\n\nFancy showed me how, but it will work for you guys too.\n\nSo I imagined it there, in the largest space I have, where I always do that kind of thing.\n\nOver and over, in all detail, but only in my imagination.  It became very dreamlike, and it wasn't even hard to visualize the moves anymore. I could even see the results of the moves.\n\nEvery single night I did  that, I ended up in Cholita's phantom copy of the house.\n\nShe expanded it...  \n\nAnyway, my dreaming double did come out but it went for the most interesting thing around.  \n\nIn Taisha's version of bringing out the double, consciously, you just do your Shotokan 2nd degree black belt forms in your mind (the most likely she was doing at the time), possibly projecting it to the ground below a tree house she was in. And it shows up.\n\nShe wanted to do something impossible. Do her martial arts on the ground, but she was in a tree.\n\nThe double helped her out.\n\nIn 4 gates dreaming, you try to get it to wake up in the real world.\n\nIt's an interesting progression, which we're \"sort of\" doing in darkroom gazing.\n\nGate 1: Look deliberately at dreaming images, using your hands as the test of lucidity.\n\nWe don't need to test lucidity, we're awake. So we just look at them.\n\nGate 2: Scout shows up, play with it, so that you end up mixing energy (and best if you go to their world, but it's not a black and white thing I suppose).\n\nWith scout energy, mess up your ability to wake up.  \n\nThat's the 3rd gate.  Go to sleep in the dream.  As deeply as you can.\n\nResult: you bounce around from dream to dream, trying to wake up.\n\nThat gives you the chance to fine tune where you wake up.\n\nAnd if you manage to prove it was your real room, you passed the 4th gate.\n\nKind of silly if you ask me. No wonder the men went apeshit over it.  Power you can make up!  No one can correct your explanation of your dream!\n\nMaybe Carlos knew the mentally ill men would flock to it.\n\nIt's been definitely harmful to the Castaneda community so far.\n\nPut it on hold.\n\nZuleica just has you visualize it doing something active, and it comes around.  Much safer to the community, because you're awake!  You can't make up stuff in your head, to make yourself feel like a real sorcerer.\n\nOf course you could simply lie, but there's remarkably little of that going on these days.\n\nCholita has taught me about Zuleica's technique.  \n\nYour dreaming double is always out there. \n\nCarlos said it was, \"Lost in Infinity\".  And impossible for a sorcerer to access, under normal circumstances.\n\nBut some people have it near by. I suppose it's learned to fine tune closer to our reality.\n\nA sorcerer can help those people more easily.\n\nThe fact that it's always out there is what Zuleica takes advantage of.  \n\nSo no need for sleeping dreaming, if all you want is a solid double.\n\nWe cheat.  It comes out because we're obsessively playing with dreaming images, and sometimes what we want to do is not possible.\n\nSame as Taisha wanting to do martial arts on the ground, from up in a tree.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo it comes out.\n\nLast night for example, after a few  hours I found myself in a cavern covered with dark green grooves.  Fine ones.\n\nNever saw that before.\n\nIt was absolutely stable. I could have stood up, walked over, and run my fingers over the grooves. They were there on the walls.\n\nWatching them,   50% tonal, 50% double.\n\nGetting up to touch them, 20% tonal, 80% double.\n\nWalking into that world, 100% double.\n\nWhere the tonal goes at that point, I don't know. You never notice the transition.  You could even bang your big toe on some furniture on the way in, and it would hurt (less than normal).", "edited": 1603819706.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gaai59t", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No.  Someone translated it and posted it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it matches what I was doing, before the book came along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a strange coincidence it showed up now.

Do her martial arts on the ground, but she was in a tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double helped her out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 4 gates dreaming, you try to get it to wake up in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an interesting progression, which we&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;sort of&amp;quot; doing in darkroom gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gate 1: Look deliberately at dreaming images, using your hands as the test of lucidity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t need to test lucidity, we&amp;#39;re awake. So we just look at them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gate 2: Scout shows up, play with it, so that you end up mixing energy (and best if you go to their world, but it&amp;#39;s not a black and white thing I suppose).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With scout energy, mess up your ability to wake up.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the 3rd gate.  Go to sleep in the dream.  As deeply as you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Result: you bounce around from dream to dream, trying to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gives you the chance to fine tune where you wake up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you manage to prove it was your real room, you passed the 4th gate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of silly if you ask me. No wonder the men went apeshit over it.  Power you can make up!  No one can correct your explanation of your dream!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe Carlos knew the mentally ill men would flock to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been definitely harmful to the Castaneda community so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Put it on hold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zuleica just has you visualize it doing something active, and it comes around.  Much safer to the community, because you&amp;#39;re awake!  You can&amp;#39;t make up stuff in your head, to make yourself feel like a real sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course you could simply lie, but there&amp;#39;s remarkably little of that going on these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita has taught me about Zuleica&amp;#39;s technique.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your dreaming double is always out there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos said it was, &amp;quot;Lost in Infinity&amp;quot;.  And impossible for a sorcerer to access, under normal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But some people have it near by. I suppose it&amp;#39;s learned to fine tune closer to our reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sorcerer can help those people more easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that it&amp;#39;s always out there is what Zuleica takes advantage of.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So no need for sleeping dreaming, if all you want is a solid double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We cheat.  It comes out because we&amp;#39;re obsessively playing with dreaming images, and sometimes what we want to do is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same as Taisha wanting to do martial arts on the ground, from up in a tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night for example, after a few  hours I found myself in a cavern covered with dark green grooves.  Fine ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never saw that before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was absolutely stable. I could have stood up, walked over, and run my fingers over the grooves. They were there on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching them,   50% tonal, 50% double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting up to touch them, 20% tonal, 80% double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Walking into that world, 100% double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where the tonal goes at that point, I don&amp;#39;t know. You never notice the transition.  You could even bang your big toe on some furniture on the way in, and it would hurt (less than normal).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_jikxdd", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jikxdd/another_power_object/gaai59t/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1603819164.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1603819164.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gaag5z0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Own_Oil7766", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ga7rknp", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_8akovn3u", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "  /// I like Taisha's technique to bring the dreaming double out, from the new book. \n\n Can you please tell me which chapter of Taisha's new book contains this technique?", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gaag5z0", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;/// I like Taisha&amp;#39;s technique to bring the dreaming double out, from the new book. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you please tell me which chapter of Taisha&amp;#39;s new book contains this technique?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_jikxdd", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jikxdd/another_power_object/gaag5z0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1603818240.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1603818240.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ga7rknp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ga7k789", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Warning: there's no guarantee that technique is good for men.  \n\nWomen are more \"mergy\" than men.\n\nMen need to pick stuff up so that they can beat someone to death with it.

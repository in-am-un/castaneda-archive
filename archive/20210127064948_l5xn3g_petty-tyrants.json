She tells them, \"He's not much to look at, but he has money.  And he likes big boobs and black women.  You're not black, but you'll do.\"\n\nAnd if she asks for something and you do her a favor and get it right away, hoping she'll notice how quickly you responded, better be exactly what she asked for.\n\n2 bottles of a specific brand of water for example. One you have to go to 3 stores to find.\n\nIf  you think to yourself, this was hard, and get 4 bottles to be safe, she'll throw all of them out.\n\nShe asked for 2, not 4.\n\nA holiday came around, and since Cholita has no friends I got her some orchids and a bottle of Sangria from Spain.\n\nShe decided the bottle meant I was going to make her bleed, and the flowers meant I was mocking her, because I could rape her at any time.\n\nShe took the vase from the orchids and cracked it to make a dagger which could sit on the floor.  She put that under my bed, below my chest, tossed the orchids under there too (some spell she  uses with vegetables and fruit where the rotting is what creates the magic),  and poured the entire bottle of sangria (blood) on my bed.\n\nHowever, her dreaming double likes me a little, and does magic once in a while.\n\nAnd she's a magnet for inorganic beings, which I eventually get to meet.  She picks them up all over the place.\n\nI don't know who \"Minx\" is, but she gave me a spectacular show when she introduced us.\n\nIt was beyond words!  A witch glowing like a sun, floating a few inches above the floor.  She showed off by raising her arms, to make them look like wings.\n\nShe had passed right through the locked bedroom door. She sat on the bed, and then Minx floated in as a little blue cloud, 2 feet off the floor.\n\nCholita's dreaming double lay on my legs, somewhat affectionately (a first).  Minx floated in front of us at the foot of the bed, rose high up above us and turned into  huge demon, about to bite my head off.\n\nI'm used to that sort of thing.  He was so bright, I started thinking how does it work?

She tells them, &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s not much to look at, but he has money.  And he likes big boobs and black women.  You&amp;#39;re not black, but you&amp;#39;ll do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if she asks for something and you do her a favor and get it right away, hoping she&amp;#39;ll notice how quickly you responded, better be exactly what she asked for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 bottles of a specific brand of water for example. One you have to go to 3 stores to find.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If  you think to yourself, this was hard, and get 4 bottles to be safe, she&amp;#39;ll throw all of them out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She asked for 2, not 4.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A holiday came around, and since Cholita has no friends I got her some orchids and a bottle of Sangria from Spain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She decided the bottle meant I was going to make her bleed, and the flowers meant I was mocking her, because I could rape her at any time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She took the vase from the orchids and cracked it to make a dagger which could sit on the floor.  She put that under my bed, below my chest, tossed the orchids under there too (some spell she  uses with vegetables and fruit where the rotting is what creates the magic),  and poured the entire bottle of sangria (blood) on my bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, her dreaming double likes me a little, and does magic once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she&amp;#39;s a magnet for inorganic beings, which I eventually get to meet.  She picks them up all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know who &amp;quot;Minx&amp;quot; is, but she gave me a spectacular show when she introduced us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was beyond words!  A witch glowing like a sun, floating a few inches above the floor.  She showed off by raising her arms, to make them look like wings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had passed right through the locked bedroom door. She sat on the bed, and then Minx floated in as a little blue cloud, 2 feet off the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita&amp;#39;s dreaming double lay on my legs, somewhat affectionately (a first).

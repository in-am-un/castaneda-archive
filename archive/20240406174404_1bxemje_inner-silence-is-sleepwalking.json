Sobriety seems to require being relatively in the middle of Man's band. At least, at first.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nSleepwalking? Does that mean this is the essence of sorcery?\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mbmoimciqvsc1.gif\n\nFirst, some  discussions from past years, in the most on-point posts:\n\n[Sleepwalking](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/dgi5kj/sleepwalking/) - 5 years ago\n\n[Sleepwalkers?](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/hx7b57/sleepwalkers/) - 4 Years ago\n\n[Sleepwalkers Breath](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/181cgdu/sleepwalkers_breath/) - 5 months ago\n\nAnd from the books, starting with *Tales of Power*:\n\nDon Genaro jutted his chin forward to indicate that I should gaze at don Juan, then he said something unintelligible. He repeated it, and although I did not understand his words, I knew that it was more or less the same formula that don Juan had voiced. The words did not really matter: It was the rhythm, the dryness of tone, the coughlike quality. I had the certainty that whatever language don Genaro was using was more appropriate than Spanish for the staccato quality of the rhythm.\n\n...\n\nDon Juan spoke in a dry murmur, addressing all of us. \"You must fix your gaze on the *nagual*\" he said. \"All thoughts and words must be washed away.\"\n\nHe repeated it five or six times. His voice was strange, unknown to me; it gave me the actual feeling of the scales on the skin of a lizard. That simile was a feeling not a conscious thought. Each of his words peeled, like scales. There was such an eerie rhythm to them. They were muffled; dry; like soft coughing; a rhythmical murmur made into a command.\n\nFrom *The Eagle's Gift*:\n\nZuleica got confused in the melee that ensued, and she cut her own hair instead.\n\nDon Juan was laughing as if it were the funniest thing ever. I heard soft coughlike bursts of laughter coming from the darkness on the far side of the patio.\n\n...\n\nThe patio was pitch black. I could hardly make out the silhouettes of the others.\n\nThen I saw the dark outline of a man standing a few-feet away from me.\n\nMy body experienced an involuntary jolt.\n\nDon Juan spoke to the man in a very low voice; saying that he had brought me to meet him. Don Juan told the man my name.\n\nAfter a moment's silence, don Juan said to me that the man's name was Silvio Manuel, and that he was the warrior of darkness and the actual leader of the whole warrior's party.\n\nThen Silvio Manuel spoke to me. I thought that he must have had a speech disorder: His voice was muffled and the words came out of him like spurts of soft coughing.\n\nHe ordered me to come closer.\n\nAs I tried to approach him, he receded, just as if he were floating.\n\nHe led me into an even darker recess of a hall, walking, it seemed, noiselessly backwards.\n\n...\n\n\"It's simplicity itself,\" la Gorda said suddenly, as if she had just thought it through. \"We were crossing, or rather Silvio Manuel was making us cross, the parallel lines. That bridge is a power spot; a hole in this world; a door to the other. We went through it. It must have hurt us to go through, because my body is scared. Silvio Manuel was waiting for us on the other side. None of us remembers his face because Silvio Manuel is the darkness, and never would he show his face. We could see only his eyes.\"\n\n\"One eye,\" Rosa said quietly, and looked away.\n\n\"Everyone here, including you,\" la Gorda said to me, \"knows that Silvio Manuel's face is in darkness. One could only hear his voice\u2014soft, like muffled coughing.\"\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nAnd on being asleep, as a product of sorcery efforts; from *The Fire From Within*:\n\nDon Juan left me alone in the room for perhaps an hour. I wanted to organize my thoughts and feelings. I had no way to do that. I knew without any doubt that my assemblage point was at a position where reasoning does not prevail, yet I was moved by reasonable concerns. **Don Juan had said that technically, as soon as the assemblage point shifts, we are asleep. I wondered, for instance, if I was sound asleep from the stand of an onlooker, just as Genaro had been asleep to me.**\n\nI asked don Juan about it as soon as he returned.\n\n**\"You are absolutely asleep without having to be stretched out,\" he replied. \"If people in a normal state of awareness saw you now, you would appear to them to be a bit dizzy, even drunk.\"**\n\n**He explained that during normal sleep, the shift of the assemblage point runs along either edge of man's band. Such shifts are always coupled with slumber. Shifts that are induced by practice occur along the midsection of man's band and are not coupled with slumber, yet a dreamer is asleep.**\n\n\"Right at this juncture is where the new and the old seers made their separate bids for power,\" he went on. \"The old seers wanted a replica of the body but with more physical strength, so they made their assemblage points slide along the right edge of man's band. The deeper they moved along the right edge the more bizarre their dreaming body became. You yourself witnessed last night the monstrous result of a deep shift along the right edge.\"\n\nHe said that the new seers were completely different; that they maintain their assemblage points along the midsection of man's band. If the shift is a shallow one, like the shift into heightened awareness, the dreamer is almost like anyone else in the street except for a slight vulnerability to emotions, such as fear and doubt. But at a certain degree of depth, the dreamer who is shifting along the midsection becomes a blob of light. A blob of light is the dreaming body of the new seers.\n\nHe also said that such an impersonal dreaming body is more conducive to understanding and examination, which are the basis of all the new seers do. The intensely humanized dreaming body of the old seers drove them to look for answers that were equally personal; humanized.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/2fdb0g0v0wsc1.gif\n\n\n\n", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Inner Silence Is Sleepwalking?!?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Silence"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"mbmoimciqvsc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "AnimatedImage", "m": "image/gif", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mbmoimciqvsc1.gif?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=png8&amp;s=711871105daa83a2f9b36ca736c9d971e3c48888"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mbmoimciqvsc1.gif?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=png8&amp;s=734c405861b91536ce3a21ba7ce40ba0ba267e77"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/mbmoimciqvsc1.gif?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=png8&amp;s=a579b1a45d1d97e5645bd9ec9e4cb2781270de0a"}], "s": {"y": 270, "gif": "https://i.redd.it/mbmoimciqvsc1.gif", "mp4": "https://preview.redd.it/mbmoimciqvsc1.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=902a17c025740db095209b49c0b48134a843bbb4", "x": 480}, "id": "mbmoimciqvsc1"}, "2fdb0g0v0wsc1": {"status": "valid", "e": "AnimatedImage", "m": "image/gif", "p": [{"y": 65, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2fdb0g0v0wsc1.gif?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=png8&amp;s=99497cd8e9cc6a8a15d3fdafba3a70b0ee0a78ea"}, {"y": 130, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2fdb0g0v0wsc1.gif?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=png8&amp;s=80abbb7004a91724074838d4b5b8bbd772f8efeb"}, {"y": 192, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2fdb0g0v0wsc1.gif?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=png8&amp;s=98650270df28bac61dd4b24e4428fa60f51a90a0"}], "s": {"y": 301, "gif": "https://i.redd.it/2fdb0g0v0wsc1.gif", "mp4": "https://preview.redd.it/2fdb0g0v0wsc1.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=7e6a5d191df5c5918663797108b5e3dd7ef3841f", "x": 500}, "id": "2fdb0g0v0wsc1"}}, "name": "t3_1bxemje", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 18, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Silence", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 18, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/UE0otR6eKsec7OIS1naMKdh9FYpg17ipt9CDFipv7Ls.jpg", "edited": 1712421689.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1712418244.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From students-chat on April 5, 2024:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Q:  Does INNER SILENCE mean that which results from total undivided focus/attention on the task at hand to the exclusion of everything else?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/danl999\"&gt;u/danl999&lt;/a&gt;:  No. That&amp;#39;s a buddhist delusion.

Still haven't seen any.\n\nAnd trust me, I see endless beings for hours each night.\n\nI feel bad for someone who hasn't found an inorganic being.\n\nI could give away 90 sightings a night lately, and I'd still see plenty of them.\n\nBut no fliers.\n\nTrouble is, without \"the fliers\",  it's too hard to explain why we get attacked so much in here, at very specific times.\n\nYou have to be someone having some crazy magical success, or doing something good for the subreddit to notice it.\n\nStuff that would \"threaten\" the Flier's \"control over earth\".\n\nA good story for Cholita, but seems wacky to me.\n\nExcept, the bad players often come in 3s!  There's a pattern.\n\nMaybe the fliers don't take any chances, and \"activate\" 3, just to make sure they get at least one attacking here.\n\nExcept that things are so bad these days, they get all 3 to \"follow orders\".\n\nThe two we had today are obvious, but I had a 3rd in private chat.\n\nIt was pretty horrible!  He started to \"witness\" for me how he'd taken drugs, and his family thought he was going crazy, but now he's ok.\n\nAnd I seem to be the only one \"put together\" in here.  So he wanted to talk.  But not learn sorcery.  He said he already had \"a spirit\".\n\nI was waiting for him to mention that it was because he found Jesus that he managed to erase the bad effect of the drugs he consumed, since his reddit history had \"God\" too much in it.\n\nBut he was as aggressive as the two bad players today!\n\nIt's very hard to take passive aggressive bullies like these, when you're have gotten rid of your internal dialogue, and they do their best to attack it directly.\n\nI just blocked him. Can't ban people, but I can block them in private chat.\n\nI complained to techno just now and he reminded me, we have someone making an introduction for new people right now.\n\nThe fliers won't like that too.\n\nAnd Techno's  all in one pdf is an amazing resource for the subreddit!\n\nIt allows me to say with authority, the word \"pussy\" came up 23 times in workshop lectures.\n\nYou couldn't have figured out out no matter what you did, before that pdf.\n\nEven Carlos would like that!\n\nFinally, some  useful inventory items.\n\nSo keep an eye on the bad players. If you have some crazy success and are all high from the \"magic buzz\", see if bad players don't attack that day.\n\nCarlos paid close attention to this too.  Even analyzed the process for us once.\n\nI should have listened more closely.

Because if they realize that&amp;#39;s what you want, the book deal mind comes in as they expect to be rewarded for going to the library to study.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if they went there to steal candy from the bowl, they keep it to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to modify the instructions to hide bowls of candy at each station in the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is why the pictures drive bad players nuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry about all the sugar, Reni.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_qxsz63", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qxsz63/bad_player_attacks/hldm7w6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1637410692.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hldj3w1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1637408281.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_qxsz63", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Wow...\n\nI'm in the darkroom in the deep orange zone, with all the secrets of the universe floating around me on surfaces.\n\nHere's a weird theory.  I still don't believe in the fliers, but it makes a good metaphor.\n\nAnd one thing I got a presentation on is stories.  And how useful those are to sorcerers for passing on knowledge that would otherwise be lost in the internal dialogue of apprentices.\n\nThe fliers mostly manipulate us via our internal dialogue, since that produces a lasting obsession, wheereas all they can really do is push on us with a little energy force, the way the kind of helpful IOB we like does, to manifest a little head.\n\nThe nasty iobs, the fliers, do the same, but to tinker with your internal dialogue.\n\nStories are tamper proof.\n\nI suppose asian  systems kind of use this, but they try to make it seem as if the stories were the absolute truth about reality, instead of just letting it be a story, so the effects can sink into the apprentice, without them feeling a need to posture and analyze and prove their worth.\n\nMeaning, if you are explained things, your internal dialogue comes in and you say things like, \"I already knew that!  Why are you telling me this don Juan???\"\n\nAnd so, we all learned from stories.  In the books.  Which contained the bad behavior manifested as stupid Carlos interacting with don Juan.\n\nEventually we could make our own stories, if we have any inclined to write.\n\nAnd music too I suppose.\n\nOne kind would describe the path of dark room gazing.  How you pass through zones, what you find there, how you should feel about it, and what the ultimate goal is.\n\nI'll try a silly one.  A peasant who lives in a remote village of somewhat dim witted villagers, gets into some kind of conflict.  He's angry at the chief, and ultimately the tribes stupid beliefs, and goes off to the larger city to seek his fortune elsewhere.\n\nNow you have an opportunity to discuss just about anything needed for the apprentice to hear, except he can't argue with the story.  It's a story!  You don't try to change a story, to boost your ego.\n\nTake the bad players today.  One thought drugs gave him sorcery knowledge, the other chakras and drinking other stuff from the river of filth.  In some ways they were infested with a story they made up about themselves, and couldn't let go of it until someone heard their story, and gave them attention for it.\n\nThey'd argue with attempts to get them to stop that, but not with a new story.  They have to respect your story, because they want you to respect theirs.\n\nSo in this story, the guy who goes to town was in the blue zone remote village, and at the entrance to the larger city he encounters the tourist area.  Easy shopping for fun trinkets.  The green zone.\n\nHe searches that area looking for amusing things, and comes to the red zone.  The adult entertainment center.\n\nBut he keeps going and finds the local's bizarre in the middle of the city. The vast orange zone, filled with practicalities, not touristy stuff.\n\nYou could pass on all kinds of darkroom tips in that story, which would go into our minds the way the abstract cores are designed to go in.\n\nBy the way, in the very deep orange zone, all choices suround  you.\n\nLiterally, and visually.  The entire room lights up with the whitish light Carlos said forms on surfaces, and you get something very much like a shopping bizarre.\n\nIOBs peak out of every ally and corner, making offers like some guy selling stolen watches under his trench coat.\n\nWhen you get to continuous seeing mode, you get lots of insights that seem important to pass along, but you can recall how easily a student tries to skip the begginers stuff because it's hard to get silent.  Mostly they want attention, no matter how much they insist that's not true, so any advanced technique they hear becomes yet another excuse to get out of learning to get silent.  They'll just skip to that and pretend they did it, the way bad players re-interpret bad dreams as magic.\n\nThey're trying to alter the story of the struggling beginner who is in pain from forcing silence. They want the story to be, the super tgalented guy skipped right to the end, avoiding all the work, and lived happily ever after, basking in the glory o fhis sorcery reputation.\n\nThat was a \"counter story\" there.  Making fun of changing the story, in story form.\n\nSo maybe you can't pass on advanced knowledge except in story form.\n\nUnless you can control them like a puppet.\n\nThere's where Tensegrity comes in.  You turn the person into the story, and they willingly obey.   Because their attention focuses on getting attention by obeying the movements better than anyone else.\n\nTricky Carlos!!! God only knows what he was thinking as he looked over the private class students, and saw how anxious the europeans were to be doing their tensetrity the best in the room.  So Carlos would notice them.\n\nI used to see him smile, thinking he was pleased.  But probably he was thinking, what a pathetic bunch of cry babies.  But they're so clueless they're actually falling for it!\n\nIf you think there's no story in those tensegrity passes, go read the gift to maui pass notes!\n\nI'm reluctant to pass this next one on, for the reasons above, but it could be that we misunderstood something.\n\nThe tensegrity is the very best way to pass from blue to green, to red, then to orange.\n\nIt really is the fastest.  It's the muscle memory thing.  It does help you get silent.  It's like feeling for cobwebs in some ways.  It requires some of your attention, and the very kind that aggravates the internal dialogue.\n\nBut once you get to the orange zone, the temptation is to explore all the stuff available.\n\nThat seems to be more effective using the tensegrity.  Instead of just playing around.  \n\nSo a good darkroom motto might be: Tensegrity? Not just good in hell.  It works in heaven too.\n\nBut in the orange zone, it's a good idea to stop being as rigid with the tensegrity, and think of it more like a dark room game.\n\nTensegrity generates a little dreaming energy too, as you do it.  It's not all that noticable in the green zone, but it's still there.  In the red zone, it's mostly covered over, the way a match would be covered over in hell.\n\nThe match still lights, but who cares?  There's fire all around you.\n\nBut the orange zone is where the emanations become visible all around you.  The whitish light.  And it amplifies even tiny bits  of energy, manifesting them as something more concrete.\n\nWhich can be abstract too, so it's not just a small appliance that might show up to represent some energy on the south wall.  Can also be \"feelings\".\n\nThe tensegrity in the orange zone becomes playing with surfaces.  Carlos lured us to discover that, by mentioning the whitish light on surfaces.\n\nThat's like telling a little kid about the bowl of candy in the library room.\n\nYou don't have to remind them about that little fact again.\n\nSo, before the orange zone, tensegrity is a form of puffery, by design.\n\nBut in the orange zone, it can become a darkroom game.\n\nAnd the IOBs love the dreaming energy it generates, because they can manifest better on that stuff.  Normally the orange zone makes it hard for them to be visible.\n\nI suppose, it's what we've discovered about the edges of puffs, being more lively.\n\nThe dreaming energy generated by the sweeping of smooth tensegrity moves in the orange zone, is nearly 100% \"edge\".\n\nSo you can literally be swirliing your arm through an IOB cave, on the walls, covered with iobs.\n\nBut the tensegrity move dreaming energy doesn't have to be consumed by iobs.\n\nConsider that the walls are covered with the whitish light that easily turns to a whole phantom room, or a translocation view.  When you do a sweeping tensegrity arm move, it's as if you are giving off tiny seeds in the trail of dreaming energy, and they take root on the walls, and grow into real things you can visually see.\n\nExcept, now you are not in the dangerous red zone where that sort of activity produces shape shifting and ties up your awareness down there in memories, turning it into a new blue zone, which is hard to escape.\n\nIn the orange zone, getting trapped is in fact our goal. It's where sorcerers want to stay.\n\nWell... purple zone actually, but the orange zone is at least weak heightened awareness the entire way, so you can park anywhere in there, at our level, and you're in good learning territory.  Anything you do in the orange zone teaches.\n\nI believe the real key to becoming a full on sorcerer, is in fact in those abstract cores.\n\nAs an example, the cover of wheel of time represents the descent of the spirit.  If I remember my cores.\n\nThe arms outstretched are acknowledgement that the manifesting sight, the amazing moons, is a gift from the spirit.  That's the moment when you realize there's nothing better for humans, and you give your allegiance to the spirit forever.\n\nBut Carlos hid that in a story.  The picture.\n\nSome ideas on  how to speed up beginners:\n\nThey just don't focus on silence!  I don't get it, but they don't.\n\nYou can be sure anyone doing advanced stuff, is always examining if they are silent, what deeper silience \"feels like\", in order to go deeper.\n\nBeginners are focused on how they can get attention from what they are doing.\n\ncontinued...", "edited": 1637410625.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hldj3w1", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in the darkroom in the deep orange zone, with all the secrets of the universe floating around me on surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a weird theory.

For a few days there, people even seemed to think I was making stuff up and hadn't really been in Carlos' private classes.\n\nI tried to invite people from private class here, even the critics,  and told them to tell their worst story about Carlos.\n\nWe can take it!\n\nI wasn\u2019t worried, because all of his techniques work!\n\nWho cares where he put his\u2026\n\nDidn\u2019t we learn our lesson with President Bill?\n\nNo one cares!\n\nBut I got no bites. I only got sob stories about disillusionment and suicidal tendencies.\n\nWhen Cholita ended up homeless in my garage, I realized she was all that was left of the private class students.\n\nAnd she was mad.\n\nBut I vowed to give her equal time in my posts, because her point of view was surely different than mine.\n\nFor example, I\u2019m sick and tired of the \u201cwarrior\u2019s way\u201d. I see being an \u201cimpeccable warrior\u201d as a placebo, like Zen gardens and crude Japanese ink drawings, which hold the imagination of Zen practitioners over in the Zen subreddit, and blind them to the truth:\n\nThey aren\u2019t reaching enlightenment.\n\nYou can\u2019t discuss or inspire yourself to enlightenment!\n\nI favor a \u201cstormtrooper\u201d approach, in honor of Star Wars.\n\nThe stormtroopers kicked Jedi butt in the end.  And now, we even have stormtrooper Jedi crossbreeds, in the latest movies.\n\nBut Cholita disagrees. She repeated what she was told by one of the witches, probably Florinda.\n\n\u201cImpeccability is the main thing. If you are impeccable, all of your decisions will be correct!\u201d\n\nCorrect decisions?\n\nI never worried about that. In fact, for a stormtrooper, your biggest hope is that all of your decisions will never be discovered.\n\nEspecially by your mom.\n\nBut equal time is equal time, so I\u2019ll relate a new Tensegrity move which Cholita showed me last night.\n\nJust keep in mind, she\u2019s completely insane. While grocery shopping, she started talking to me amidst all the other shoppers at Sprouts. Actually, she was shouting it across the store.\n\nI was quite far away, eyeing the dried figs.\n\n\u201cI love sex!  I suppose you want me to be an untouched virginal woman? Would you like that???\u201d\n\nWe hadn't spoken a word for 10 minutes, and certainly nothing about that topic all day long.\n\nAll I could say, as I rushed closer to her, and the produce manager walked by us with his head turned the other way,\n\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Yea, sure.  All men like that!\u201d\n\nThat was her state of mind last night, when she taught me a modified version of \u201cteasing the web\u201d.\n\nI have to back up to explain this move. We\u2019ve been trying to get Cholita a couch for the living room for months, ever since she disassembled the original couch and put it out by the garbage.\n\nBut every time we go into the furniture store, she picks out the most expensive couch she can find and then starts selecting an entire living room of furniture to go with it.\n\nI must admit it\u2019s nice, and it would be fun to see Cholita laying on the couch amidst all that wealth.\n\nBut it\u2019s too expensive, especially since she does that kind of thing once a week.\n\nI turned and left. Cholita ran behind me, sweet talking into my ear, and grabbed the inside of my arms with her clawed fingers.\n\nShe squeezed so hard that I was sure I\u2019d have fingernail bruise marks the next day. All the while, she was cooing and smiling at my face, while the other shoppers passed us at the door entrance.  She made it impossible for me to remove her hands, and I had to suffer until we got outdoors.\n\nAfter we'd gotten into the car and were exiting the parking lot, she stood up a little in her chair, claws up in the air, and chanted.\n\nOr growled. Frankly I can\u2019t recall, but it was very strange.   It seemed to me, she was trying to force her will.\n\nAt the time I didn\u2019t realize it:  Her hands were in the position of \u201cteasing the web\u201d.\n\nI knew she was doing witchcraft, but had no idea it was from Castaneda\u2019s techniques.\n\nAnd so last night, when she demonstrated it again, I recognized it.\n\nShe\u2019d just purchased additions to her paradise garden in our yard,  we\u2019d taken them home, and were headed to get groceries for her.\n\nCholita thumbed through her cellphone, until she came to a picture that got her attention.\n\nShe turned to look at me and asked, \u201cDaniel.   So what about this?   **What is it????**\u201d\n\nI looked over to see she was forming 2 tense claws with her hands, holding them up at the level of her shoulders, stretch out as far as she could in the car.\n\nI knew she meant witchcraft,  and might be implying I had bewitched her with that move, so I replied, \u201cI never use that. I prefer the single handed claw, the one that turns a doorknob.\u201d\n\nI showed her which one. Indeed, it was my favorite for summoning Allies.\n\nCholita replied, \u201cSo you\u2019re grabbing things with it?  Stealing???\u201d\n\nCholita is a paranoid schizophrenic. They have common problems.  Losing things, and blaming others for the loss,  is one of them.\n\nCholita\u2019s so bad that if she gets eager and eats all the Queso Cotija from her refried beans, a minute or two later she\u2019ll point to the bowl and say, \u201cLook!  It\u2019s happened again.  Someone is eating my food right off my plate!\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve learned to order a side of cheese when she has beans. Plus I bribed the handsome gay waiter at her favorite place, to keep an eye out for her.  Especially her wine glass. Keep it full.\n\nI answered her accusation in a way that seems to work lately.\n\n\u201cIn this family Honey, you\u2019re the thief.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why that works.  But she sighs, and seems satisfied.\n\nCholita bought up half of Sprouts Grocery store, especially the bogus nutritional supplements, we went home, and around 1AM I began to practice silence in the dark.\n\nIf I practice 1 hour, I can see puffs of purple smoke in the air. They\u2019ll have hypnogogic faces on them, and I can extract a temporary playmate for the evening.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like watching a realistic looking character, to move the assemblage point further into the second attention.\n\nAt the 2 hour mark, I reach the point where there\u2019s dreaming fog everywhere. I can focus on an intersection of vague details, and intercept people\u2019s dreams.\n\nBut at the 3 hour mark of \"silence in darkness\", just short of stopping the world, I find an endless paradise of magic.\n\nLast night I was smoothly scooping my raised hand on the right side, to concentrate purple light into the center. Then I scooped my left hand the same way. It was the decision making pass, but with the palms inward, instead of towards the V spot.\n\nI was looking between my hands, which were both raised at the level of my face, and separated around 18 inches.  I kept pushing purple light into the center.\n\nThe purple light was swirling with activity. People, places, objects. Orbs, twinkling lights.\n\nPretty much what you\u2019d use in a movie about Merlin the Magician. I\u2019d summoned the \u201cmagic ether\u201d, and was searching for specific people.\n\nI noticed that my hands were in the position of \u201cteasing the web\u201d. It was a tensegrity move that Kylie joked about, in some workshop notes. You wiggle your fingers in front of you all over, to stimulate the cobwebs of light that are supposedly there.\n\nOf course, it works much better when you can actually *see* them, as opposed to pretending, the way everyone had to do when that move was first taught at a workshop.\n\nI wiggled my fingers, and the purple ether became more intense. Cobwebs interrupted the purple light each time I tickled the air in front of me.\n\nI stopped, and it faded a bit, back to the normal intensity level.\n\nWhich is quite bright, I should say. There\u2019s nothing vague about it. It\u2019s as bright as you\u2019d like it to be, if you have to gaze into it for an hour to find what you want.\n\nI realized, that looks a lot like what Cholita was trying to show me.\n\nI tensed up my fingers, remembering how much Cholita\u2019s finger nails hurt, when she dug them into my arm. They were so tense, my fingers began to cramp a bit.\n\nI tried to imitate what that must have felt like to her, cupping my fingers in the shape you\u2019d have, if you were grabbing the bottom of someone\u2019s arms, from behind them. It was like an act of will, combined with intense concentration on what is in front of you.\n\nIn fact, it was like a cartoon mom grabbing a bad kid's ear, and pinching it hard while she forces him to march in her direction.  An act of will.\n\nThe scene I was watching, of a man standing next to a corner, froze. When I released the tension he began to move again. He was going around the corner, and had halfway disappeared when I intensified the grabbing pressure.\n\nIt reminded me of grabbing rocks as a silence technique. When you want deeper silence, you squeeze them harder.\n\nSqueezing that way, I was able to pull the man back. I reversed the flow of time in that dream, and he backed up to his previous position.\n\nI kept playing with him like that for a bit, verifying I could move him like a puppet now.\n\nOnly one thought remained in my mind at that point.\n\nIs Cholita punking me?\n\nEdited twice\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Clawing the Web", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Misc.

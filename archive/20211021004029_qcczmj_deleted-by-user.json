A typical one who comes in here.\n\nIt's true that it's the same general principles which control each.  Sorcery magic, and OBE magic.\n\nIt's just that with OBE, you have a false explanation of what's going on, based on generations of attention seeking people who wanted money.\n\nOlmec shamanism, such as we practice, is pre-agriculture, pre-cities, and likely pre-money.\n\nThere was never a time when misrepresenting what it was, could do anyone any good.\n\nIn fact, the Olmec were very interested in a PRECISE understanding of what they were doing.\n\nNo book deal possibilities for them.\n\nSo with OBE you're running on a \"false narrative\" created over hundreds of years (thousands even) that will make it impossible for you to successfully go the path that's \"real\".\n\nWe're following the force of *intent*, which creates all of reality.  Trying to clean our link to it, so we can manipulate reality directly.\n\nOBE is merely using your dreaming body.  Which includes your ordinary dream body.\n\nNot as a \"double\" for the most part, just as a lucid dream that's weird enough to share with someone else.  To be \"the double\", it only has to be in this copy of reality, instead of a slightly modified one.\n\nIn manipulating intent (reality), we summon dreams that float in the air and can enter those (leap in), manipulate them like solid matter, send our spirits into them to investigate, or do any number of other cool things with them.\n\nIts' possible to form a dream into a bubble, and throw it at someone to \"snatch\" them into it.\n\nSo \"the double\" is only a fraction of our interest.  And it's an automatic part.  You don't pursue it.  You can't.\n\nYou lure it out, by being interesting to it.

It's a real part of our life.\n\nIn the case of our \"double\", it will sit on the end of the bed with us, and let us communicate with it.\n\nIt can go visit another person, and they can visually see it.\n\nIt can even touch things, with a force of a couple of ounces.\n\nMy witch friend even sends her \"double\" to rescue me, when I get stuck in another layer of reality. Or to show me techniques that interest her, like manifesting dead people.\n\nThat's all a tiny fraction of what we get to actually do, nightly.\n\nMy experience is that anyone who's done too much OBE, cannot learn sorcery.\n\nTheir thinking is so messed up, they won't let go of believing the stories they were told while learning OBE.\n\nIt's dominated by bad people, seeking money and attention from others, not caring who they deceive with their \"book deal\".\n\nAnd people who practice it are playing with the easiest to misrepresent thing:  dreams.\n\nIf they can't do anything special they take any ordinary dream, and make up some reason it was an OBE.\n\nAnd bash their friends over the head with it, to get attention.\n\nThe result is an angry person who won't let go and find the truth, because to do so would be to deny the pride they've built up, based on their misunderstood experiences.\n\nAstral travel is also a death trap for the same reason.\n\nA false narrative is implanted in the person's mind, and then based on some fun experiences they are hooked.\n\nIt's like giving some fake stock in a company that went bankrupt years ago.\n\nThey have $20M in stock!\n\nImagine how angry they'll be when you try to point that out.\n\nSome simply will not let go of the false teaching.\n\nSame happens to Buddhists. They're taught a number of false narratives, and based on those their ability to learn sorcery is seriously damaged.\n\nIf you could let go of the ego gratification many get from pretending to be following the OBE false narrative, then whatever you learned doing that would help you a tiny bit when you learn to move your assemblage point.\n\nBut no one ever seems to be able to do that.\n\nThey come in here as if they have a \"secret\" they're going to reveal to others here, to get their deserved respect, and when they don't they explode.  Try to harm someone even, and storm out.\n\nYou could be the first not to do that!\n\nI'm sort of exaggerating here, because surely we have some OBE \"dabblers\", just as we have Buddhism dabblers, and any other kind of magic chasing you could imagine.\n\nAnd they've blended in.\n\nMaybe it's just the OBEs with a huge chip on their shoulder that stand out, and it's not even a high percentage of those, who can't learn sorcery due to ego.\n\nI'd recommend to an OBE person to focus almost entirely on getting yourself an inorganic being helper.  As soon as possible.\n\nSo you get over that false narrative.\n\nThey can move solid objects if you develop a close friendship.\n\nThey seem to need to \"borrow\" our energy to do it.\n\nThey can also take you to their world.\n\nSo that you will learn, fully awake, with your eyes open, to walk right through the wall.\n\nWITH your body.

They&amp;#39;re taught a number of false narratives, and based on those their ability to learn sorcery is seriously damaged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you could let go of the ego gratification many get from pretending to be following the OBE false narrative, then whatever you learned doing that would help you a tiny bit when you learn to move your assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But no one ever seems to be able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They come in here as if they have a &amp;quot;secret&amp;quot; they&amp;#39;re going to reveal to others here, to get their deserved respect, and when they don&amp;#39;t they explode.  Try to harm someone even, and storm out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could be the first not to do that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sort of exaggerating here, because surely we have some OBE &amp;quot;dabblers&amp;quot;, just as we have Buddhism dabblers, and any other kind of magic chasing you could imagine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they&amp;#39;ve blended in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s just the OBEs with a huge chip on their shoulder that stand out, and it&amp;#39;s not even a high percentage of those, who can&amp;#39;t learn sorcery due to ego.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend to an OBE person to focus almost entirely on getting yourself an inorganic being helper.  As soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you get over that false narrative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can move solid objects if you develop a close friendship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They seem to need to &amp;quot;borrow&amp;quot; our energy to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can also take you to their world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that you will learn, fully awake, with your eyes open, to walk right through the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WITH your body.

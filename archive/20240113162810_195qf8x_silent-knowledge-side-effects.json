When I got back there was no damage to my body anywhere.\n\nHow????\n\nThere's absolutely nothing to indicate you didn't just leap through the ceiling into the stars, using your real legs.  Or leap through a window that isn't really there.\n\nI mean, that's what you do!!!\n\nIt's one reason darkroom is as it is. Where you're doing tensegrity the whole time, eyes open, wide awake, completely sober.\n\nTo avoid delusional people who make up stuff, if they get to sit down a bit and doze off.\n\nDarkroom was designed to prevent fraud, by one of the Allies of Carlos.\n\nAnd it actually hurts a bit when you land on another planet outside our galaxy!\n\nOr let's take shapeshifting.\n\nDid you REALLY?\n\nBeats me. Sure seems that way.\n\nI shapeshifted once, didn't realize it, then went outside in the middle of the night because I knew Cholita had gone to bed.\n\nAnd it was safe to look around.\n\nI needed to check if she'd gotten a DMV sticker for her car.  You have to renew it each year in California. They give you a sticker indicating the year it's good until.\n\nCholita has trouble following rules such as \"you have to renew your car registration\".\n\nI'd do it for her, but she won't allow me.\n\nSo I walked outside barefoot to go look at both the front and back of her car. To see if she'd gotten a sticker yet and put it on a license plate.\n\nBut the grass was wet, and very cold.\n\nCholita sometimes waters one spot on the grass, that spot I had to walk over to get to the street, for days on end.\n\nSo I stepped quickly to get past the cold wet grass, and practically jumped onto the dry sidewalk beyond the grass.  The sidewalk that heads to my driveway.\n\nExcept Cholita had scattered sharp little stones right on the spot where I landed.\n\nIt looked like a trap to me, once I examined the situation.\n\nShe does that sort of thing...\n\nDon't doubt it.  I just don't make pictures and post them, or she'd finally finish me off.\n\nSo jumping up and down quietly shouting \"Shit, shit, shit that hurts like hell...\" I glanced over at her car.\n\nIt was too far away for me to see the sticker.\n\nAnd I didn't want to risk more sharp little stones, so I stretched my arm out around 20 feet, and lifted the car in one hand.\n\nFor real!\n\nNope.  No stickers.\n\nStill none to this day in fact. One of these days they'll tow her car away.\n\nI hobbled back into the house and went back to my locked darkroom to be safe and warm again.\n\nAnd realized,\n\n\"SHIT!!!!  I just lifted the car in one hand???\"\n\nYes, I did!\n\nCan that be explained?\n\nCarlos did explain it. In a private class. I'd shifted my assemblage point to the right around 3 inches.  In the deep red zone.\n\nNOT to the left. The strength of a huge beast is to the right.\n\nTo the left, and you might turn into a fly...\n\nJadey and I both frown on turning into insects.\n\nBut in fact, unexplainable, laws of physics breaking activities happen in the books all the time. \n\nPeople do the impossible, but when it's over there's some aspects which can't be explained.  Such as how they got back where they started before they broke all known laws of reality.\n\nPeople just ignore those details in the books.\n\nAnyway, how come the Dzogchen pretenders and Hindu Con artists get to do everything with their eyes closed,  grinning to suck up attention and donations,  and no one calls them out on it?\n\nOn how all of their \"magic\" is done with their eyes closed.\n\nBut we're held to some imaginary higher standard?!\n\nAre you speculating that humans can simply hallucinate whatever they like?\n\nWhere?\n\nWho?\n\nShow me on the internet.\n\nAnd if humans could easily confuse themselves and hallucinate a reality as real as this one, don't you think all of society would know about this and be constantly warning people not to trust what they see?\n\nThere is of course a full explanation of this topic.\n\nIn the books.\n\nBut it would take too long to go into it.\n\nAnd it comes up constantly in posts, so anyone reading daily will eventually understand what's going on here.", "edited": 1705176339.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_khpmrl1", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly doesn&amp;#39;t seem possible to me that my physical body just stood there for hours, while I was out exploring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been gone through an impossible exit to my locked room, for as long as 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And without any bump on my forehead or bruised shoulders from collapsing to the ground.

Where you&amp;#39;re doing tensegrity the whole time, eyes open, wide awake, completely sober.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To avoid delusional people who make up stuff, if they get to sit down a bit and doze off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Darkroom was designed to prevent fraud, by one of the Allies of Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it actually hurts a bit when you land on another planet outside our galaxy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or let&amp;#39;s take shapeshifting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you REALLY?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beats me. Sure seems that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shapeshifted once, didn&amp;#39;t realize it, then went outside in the middle of the night because I knew Cholita had gone to bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it was safe to look around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I needed to check if she&amp;#39;d gotten a DMV sticker for her car.  You have to renew it each year in California. They give you a sticker indicating the year it&amp;#39;s good until.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita has trouble following rules such as &amp;quot;you have to renew your car registration&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d do it for her, but she won&amp;#39;t allow me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I walked outside barefoot to go look at both the front and back of her car. To see if she&amp;#39;d gotten a sticker yet and put it on a license plate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the grass was wet, and very cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita sometimes waters one spot on the grass, that spot I had to walk over to get to the street, for days on end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I stepped quickly to get past the cold wet grass, and practically jumped onto the dry sidewalk beyond the grass.  The sidewalk that heads to my driveway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except Cholita had scattered sharp little stones right on the spot where I landed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looked like a trap to me, once I examined the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She does that sort of thing...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t doubt it.  I just don&amp;#39;t make pictures and post them, or she&amp;#39;d finally finish me off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So jumping up and down quietly shouting &amp;quot;Shit, shit, shit that hurts like hell...&amp;quot; I glanced over at her car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was too far away for me to see the sticker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I didn&amp;#39;t want to risk more sharp little stones, so I stretched my arm out around 20 feet, and lifted the car in one hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For real!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nope.  No stickers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still none to this day in fact. One of these days they&amp;#39;ll tow her car away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hobbled back into the house and went back to my locked darkroom to be safe and warm again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And realized,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;SHIT!!!!  I just lifted the car in one hand???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I did!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can that be explained?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos did explain it. In a private class. I&amp;#39;d shifted my assemblage point to the right around 3 inches.  In the deep red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOT to the left. The strength of a huge beast is to the right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the left, and you might turn into a fly...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jadey and I both frown on turning into insects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in fact, unexplainable, laws of physics breaking activities happen in the books all the time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People do the impossible, but when it&amp;#39;s over there&amp;#39;s some aspects which can&amp;#39;t be explained.  Such as how they got back where they started before they broke all known laws of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People just ignore those details in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, how come the Dzogchen pretenders and Hindu Con artists get to do everything with their eyes closed,  grinning to suck up attention and donations,  and no one calls them out on it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On how all of their &amp;quot;magic&amp;quot; is done with their eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#39;re held to some imaginary higher standard?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you speculating that humans can simply hallucinate whatever they like?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Show me on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if humans could easily confuse themselves and hallucinate a reality as real as this one, don&amp;#39;t you think all of society would know about this and be constantly warning people not to trust what they see?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is of course a full explanation of this topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it would take too long to go into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it comes up constantly in posts, so anyone reading daily will eventually understand what&amp;#39;s going on here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_195qf8x", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/195qf8x/silent_knowledge_side_effects/khpmrl1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1705175946.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "khp5ces", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Catricel", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1705169790.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_195qf8x", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_v06hs1vd", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "\"In your physical body\" \u2013 So another person won't find me hallucinating with silly smile?

If it&amp;#39;s not, then you&amp;#39;re just blocking yourself from discovering the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;puffs&amp;quot; are pieces of your double!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hiding around 4-8 feet away from you.  Only silence and tensegrity can convince it to come to the middle, where you can see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine all the power of your dreamer, who without the burden of your physical body is completely free from pain, hunger, or the need for anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being who roams anywhere in the universe he likes. In your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s real! Just lost in infinity because he has access to all realities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You stick him in a huge barrel 16 feet in diameter, with a stinky homeless guy glued to the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Muttering to himself all day about how he&amp;#39;s going to &amp;quot;teach that guy a real lesson&amp;quot;.  But then he cries, laughs, and is generally really scary and dangerous looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;, whether you can see it or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dreaming double is so powerful, he doesn&amp;#39;t even need to be a single being!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He can be as many as 8, all sentient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He can split into pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you were that purple puff of your dreaming double, what would you do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Press as close to the side of the barrel to get away from that bastard in the middle, as you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you &amp;quot;visualize&amp;quot; stuff, you&amp;#39;re only making yourself less attractive to your all powerful double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to stop muttering to yourself, and imaging all the revenge or praise you&amp;#39;ll get, because &amp;quot;you deserve it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then  he becomes interested.  When you&amp;#39;re no longer a stinky homeless guy ranting to yourself all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Tensegrity even &amp;quot;lures&amp;quot; him out, when he sees you&amp;#39;re engaged in a fun activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all REAL!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Small children already know that.  That&amp;#39;s the odd thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if you never see any puffs or colors, DO NOT revert to visualizing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mistake is that your silence is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are not silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the absolute truth. You yourself will realize this one day, and also realize, you didn&amp;#39;t understand this statement. Even though it now seems so obvious, you can make individual objects vanish in front of your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WHEN YOU ARE SILENT, THE WORLD SIMPLY STOPS!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the even more fun &amp;quot;corollary&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WHEN YOU ARE SILENT, THE OBJECT FACING YOU OFFERS YOU ANOTHER CHOICE OF FORM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world is only upheld by your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are silent, it ends.  It can&amp;#39;t fail to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you find yourself facing the control room.  Which by the way, takes various forms.  Many forms... As many as humans. The control room is trace awareness, which varies from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if the world didn&amp;#39;t stop, you were not silent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the world &amp;quot;mutates&amp;quot; if you get even a small amount of silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the double notices, and comes to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A puff comes out of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for them at a distance first, circling around trying to figure out if &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s safe&amp;quot; now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unbending intent long form, at 5:22 shows this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw mine first starting high up to my right on the ceiling, and flowing down to my far left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like they were glued to a rotating sphere around 8 feet in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trying to avoid me, but curious enough to circle around watching.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_yzvbf2", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "treatment_tags": [], "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yzvbf2/stuff_for_beginners_to_do_in_darkroom/ix5la00/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1668983917.0, "author_flair_text": null, "collapsed": false, "created_utc": 1668983917.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ix5d8yg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Tinfoilheadx", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ix5apyz", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_8kys9k4z", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "To be clear I have to choose 2 of those 9 movements, learn them and perform them in silence.\n\nI've been visualizing to much so thanks for that tip.\nI'm a beginner and have not seen any real puffs yet (I think the ones I did saw were imagined) although I did notice that with some movement I start to see colors like green/purple, unorganized", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ix5d8yg", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear I have to choose 2 of those 9 movements, learn them and perform them in silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been visualizing to much so thanks for that tip.\nI&amp;#39;m a beginner and have not seen any real puffs yet (I think the ones I did saw were imagined) although I did notice that with some movement I start to see colors like green/purple, unorganized&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_yzvbf2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/yzvbf2/stuff_for_beginners_to_do_in_darkroom/ix5d8yg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1668980472.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1668980472.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ix5apyz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ix4l9zo", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Find \"mashing energy\".

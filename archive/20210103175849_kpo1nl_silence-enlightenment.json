Enlightenment and magic have always been tied together in esoteric literature. It's mostly just the Zen people who shun it, as far as I can tell.

It's the most AWFUL thing you'll ever have to do. To learn to shut off that internal dialogue.\n\nBut, you get EVERYTHING.  Daoist enlightenment, Hindu Enlightenment, Buddhist Enlightenment.  You'll be able to critique either of the Krishnamurtis, and rightly conclude they were na\u00efve. From direct experience.\n\nAnd you'll say, \"foey!\" to book deal mystics, even the most famous of them.  Ouspe.... and Gurdj...\n\nDon't want to step on any toes.\n\nBut really?  That stuff motivates you?\n\nIt won't after you get to heightened awareness.\n\nYou might even dare to say total blasphemy!\n\nI'll do it!!!\n\nThe Buddha was kind of confused...\n\nSo when newbies come in here and start complaining about \"puffery\",  and \"do we all have to do that???\", without even understanding what it is, and suggest you ought to take their vast experience into account, and think about something else, they just haven't done their homework.\n\nHaven't been around long enough to notice it's all fake out there.\n\nAnd mostly, they want attention.  Never saw magic, never tasted enlightenment, so they're dwelling in endless misery.\n\nMisery loves company. So they show up here.  Probably after being cast out of other places, for bad behavnior.\n\nNo wonder they come in here and try to control it for their own benefit.  Worn out everything else.\n\nJust remember. No matter who comes in here, from where, the goal they seek is darkroom gazing.\n\nThey just haven't understood what's going on around them yet.\n\nIs there another path?\n\nOf course!\n\nWe've all been begging for one!\n\nThere's no \"one path\" tyranny here.\n\nIt's just all we have so far.  A few of us are testing Zuleica's daytime gazing, with excellent results.\n\nBut it's still not well tested.\n\nI wish someone would become a mirror in water gazer. That has promise.\n\nBut we just don't get any other alternate paths. Which are proven.\n\nNot some hot shot's \"idea\", which he proposes to everyone to get some attention, but hasn't actually tried himself.\n\nNo one brings viable paths here.\n\nThey bring nonsense mostly.\n\n(By the way, Carlos used to talk like this all the time. I've merely toned it down a bit.)\n\nAnyone who wants can pop a load of shrooms, and run around in caves with their \"benefactor\".\n\nIf that's what they believe sorcery is, great! Just watch where he's pointing that thing he keeps in his pants.\n\nBut there's nothing to teach in that. Nothing to help others with.\n\nThere's nothing to teach, in our lucid dreaming experiences.  Nothing of benefit to others, unless you managed to learn to bring the double into the real world.\n\nIt's just attention seeking nonsense to post about it here.\n\nWhich is fine.\n\nIt's only attention seeking nonsense delivered with bullying that gets criticism here.\n\nIf you want to post a pic of yourself in a clown suit, you truly won't get thrown out for it.\n\nIt's when you harm others, with ideas which prevent success, or with endless fighting, that trouble might find you in here.\n\nThere's an invisible partner in this subreddit.\n\nIntent.\n\nWe can chase it away if we aren't careful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "SILENCE = ENLIGHTENMENT", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"3x4janxyg5961": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 93, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3x4janxyg5961.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc66e33fb645f4487189cf23080d9b828834826a"}, {"y": 187, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3x4janxyg5961.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ba1a54e087c9f987957a9ab576564eebfbdf85a"}, {"y": 278, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3x4janxyg5961.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80046c10a822bbe5edf878094276009862fe7df1"}], "s": {"y": 421, "x": 484, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/3x4janxyg5961.jpg?width=484&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c95d1babdaef201340b454d6a1669383a664a0f6"}, "id": "3x4janxyg5961"}}, "name": "t3_kpo1nl", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 17, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gYSSf71Vo7w?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 356, "scrolling": false, "height": 200}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "THE QUICKEST WAY TO ENLIGHTENMENT ~ Shinzen Young", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gYSSf71Vo7w?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "version": "1.0", "author_name": "Shinzen Videos", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gYSSf71Vo7w/hqdefault.jpg", "type": "video", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/ShinzenInterviews"}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gYSSf71Vo7w?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 356, "scrolling": false, "media_domain_url": "https://www.redditmedia.com/mediaembed/kpo1nl", "height": 200}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/BEwU3cpfhHQ8VMVjROm3-hJPp-4PtCZ9uBZidsKpSGQ.jpg", "edited": 1609694393.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1609693129.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3x4janxyg5961.jpg?width=484&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c95d1babdaef201340b454d6a1669383a664a0f6\"&gt;Wasn&amp;#39;t one Russian \\&amp;quot;explainer\\&amp;quot; enough to last forever?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;#39;t forget this!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s Shinzen (westernized &amp;quot;Taiwanese Zen&amp;quot; master), but there are many others.

for \"Zuleica\".  But it's mentioned in other books.\n\n\"Finding your Spot\" is darkroom practice.\n\nTensegrity itself was designed to be visible, when you learn to \"see energy\".\n\nUnfortunately, in full daylight that's a tall order!\n\nWorks a little in subdued light. I saw my first \"great band of emanations\" at a workshop, where I presume Bruce Wagner turned down the lights.\n\nBut otherwise, darkroom gazing is merely Zuleica's \"finding colors\" in darkness, taking into account, \"Finding your spot.\"\n\nRemember that Zuleica was the dreaming teacher in the group.\n\nI was practicing the beginnings of darkroom gazing with Little Smoke, left to private classes by Carlos.  I seemed to be the only one who realized she was available.\n\nI had the lame idea to turn her into a Fairy, a Siberian Cat, and a Pumpkin you could toss, the way the headless horseman did.\n\nI didn't know if anyone else would be able to see her, but I figured if they could the dazzling light show she could give them would send goosebumps up their bodies, and move their assemblage points.\n\nOnce I could show them what moving the assemblage point feels like, I figured maybe people would stop pretending and get serious.\n\nLittle Smoke patiently let me turn her into a 4 inch tall fairy, a beautiful grey Siberian cat, and she even turned into an orange pumpkin for me.  No lid.  Not sure why no lid.  But her little face was stuck to the top, as if she were riding on it.\n\nI tossed it at the wall, and it exploded in a blaze of fireworks.\n\nI was thinking, \"This is it!  This will work!\"\n\nWhat I didn't realize was, Little Smoke had just taught me how everyone can move their own assemblage point, without needing anyone else around.\n\nI learned it, because in order to get her to turn into a pumpkin, I had to have absolute silence, and I had to gaze intently at her for a continuous stretch.\n\nResult: Heightened awareness.  I'd been there before through stalking, so I knew it well.\n\nIt's when the angels come down to sing for you, and circle around your head.\n\nSort of.  I got that image from Yogananda's master. His wife saw that once while he was resting on the bed.\n\nTo get there, just play with the colors you can find in darkness, using Tensegrity moves.\n\nOnce you realize that they are fully visible in darkness, and try various ones to see what they look like, you realize Carlos had this planned all along.\n\nBut he was afraid to spring it on us.  People fall to pieces when real magic starts to show up.\n\nIt's those demons.  People are still racist, and the demon race gets it the worst.\n\nIt could have been fatal to his workshops, if you had a bunch of people saying it was harmful.  And that surely would have happened, if he let people learn at full speed.\n\nSo he figured he'd \"hose them off\" a while, the way sorcerers are said to do for people who escape the river of filth.\n\nDid you hear of that one? Not mentioned in the books, as far as I know.\n\nHis plan was Tensegrity, Recapitulation, and then \"Stop the World\".\n\nOdd that Cleargreen doesn't remember that last step...\n\nWhen it turned out Carlos had run out of time, he taught us the missing part of the puzzle.\n\nPuffery.\n\nAnd indeed, it's caused a fright or two in people. It's just that now we have a large enough community who has been successful at it, that people won't freak out 100%.\n\nJust 40% perhaps.\n\nIf a demon actually eats someone, I supposed we'll have a problem.\n\nBut man, imagine the bragging rights!!!\n\nWe could look up some \"Kundalini\" people, and get them to brag about how disturbing it can be, when the Kundalini rises.\n\nWe'd get to say, \"Oh yea? How'd you like to be eaten by a fu..ing demon!!!??  That's how much more powerful sorcery is!\"\n\nThey might piss their yoga diapers.\n\nIt's ok to be petty sometimes, especially if it's funny.\n\nCarlos used to do that in his own way.\n\nHe had an imitation of himself, behaving badly in social situations.\n\nUsed it as a straw man.", "edited": 1609712114.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gi00swf", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The darkroom practice.. never heard of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eagle&amp;#39;s Gift, search for &amp;quot;Zuleica&amp;quot;.

Are you guys kidding?\n\nAt the very least, there ought to be tons of fun stories.  Not just a few, and the Buddha always smells like flowers.\n\nThat's called, \"pretend\".   Likely the Budda was just a typical bad player like we get 3 times a week.\n\nBut he hit the jackpot, like Robert Monroe with his crappy Monroe Institute.\n\nWhich will destroy your ability to learn sorcery, if you actually take all of his \"classes\".\n\nOr whatever they call stealing your money.\n\nLet's try to put this in perspective.  Imagine everyone in the world lives in Shanghai, where the Chinese government has locked up everyone.  Pretending it's because of Covid.  And somehow that goes on several generations.  Until not a single living person has gone outside.\n\nSome man named, \"Budda Bob\" gets hold of some binoculars, and looks outside.\n\nThen he makes up stories of his amazing adventures sneaking outside in defiance of the government.\n\nBut he's only got like 3 decent stories.  And they're kind of pitiful.\n\nHe went to the Kentucky fried Chicken.  Big deal, I've been to that very one myself.\n\nAnd he found some stray hookers in blue dresses, and because he's a Saint he turned his back.\n\nThat's the Budda guy.  So why do people fall for it?  Why did our only double male Tony, fall for it?\n\nNow he has nothing...\n\nIt's because they have a built in \"bad player reward system\"!\n\nBuddhism is motivated by greed to be famous.  To sit on the little throne, and have the Dali Lama praise your amazing wisdom.\n\nSo you can cheat people too.\n\nThat's the lure of Buddhism.\n\nIt sure can't be magic!  They don't actually have any.\n\nI'd get tossed into a pit of corpses, locked in to die, if I went around trying to wake up those in slavery to Buddhism.\n\nAs Buddhists have actually done, so that they didn't technically \"take a life\".\n\nThey're ok pimping young women, but taking a life is were they draw the line.  So they'll just get some rotting corpses to do that part.\n\nIn Japan, they used to crucify Christians who came to convert people.\n\nOk...\n\nCan't criticize that.   Sounds better than the Jehovah's witness contamination they have in Taiwan.  They should have just crucified one of them for a few minutes, let him down, and deported him.\n\nNow they have Christians in an ancestor worshipping country.  And they won't even share the Buddhist temple like other tiny religious factions.\n\nSorry, got carried away.  Christians in Asia are just plain nuts.  Even Paul was told by God to stay out of Asia.  And said so in the bible.\n\nBut a REAL story about going outside in locked down Shanghai, would be hundreds of stories.\n\nAn everyday thing.  Until you got tired of it and realized, it's perfectly normal to go outside. It doesn't make Buddha Bob a saint.\n\nIt just means you have a very crappy social order.\n\nLikewise for the con artist Krishnamurti,  the Daoist deceiver Lao Tsu,  and the Brazilian favorite, Gurdjieff.\n\nHe helps explain Castaneda?  Really???  What exactly is he famous for anyway other than painting sparrows pretty colors so he could sell them in the market place?\n\nAnd any famous hindu who's name is impossible to remember.  It won't do anyone any good, to go on and on about \"higher\" states of consciousness.  If it were even true, it would keep you from getting there. Not help.\n\n\"Knowing\" is expecting, and it's a dirty link to intent!\n\nThe more \"sacred scriptures\" fill your head, the worse your chances are to go outside.\n\nAll of those famous \"spiritual men\" just got some binoculars, and are trying to con people who \"never get out\" with made up stories about life in the sunlight.\n\nAnd you fell for it!\n\nWe all did.\n\nBut what's normal is, you actually DO get to go outside and explore the world!\n\nAnd you don't need chanting monks to follow you, or angels signing over your head.\n\nIt's just outdoors, that's all.\n\nThe second attention is just \"places to go, things to see\".\n\nIt's only a big deal if everyone around you is faking.\n\nSO DON'T FAKE IT!\n\nBut yes.   You do actually have to put in some work to remove the blinders that have been placed over our eyes.\n\nThe internal dialogue.\n\nAnd because we're all lousy \"Buddha Boys\", stealing crummy old worn out Hinduism and pretending to revolutionize it so we can cheat most of Asia, you need to be forced to be honest.\n\nThat's what darkroom is for.  You can't cheat.\n\nYou can lie to others, but you can't make it work for yourself unless it really did.\n\nOr you drug yourself up. Which eventually ends any possibility of you learning the real thing.\n\nDon't do that!\n\nBy the way, \"working\" is not \"I saw some orbs!\"\n\nWorking is, \"I don't want to tell you what I did last night.  You'll lynch me.\"\n\nI believe we might need a \"Practical Magic\" flair!\n\nThere's more coming if we don't lose the subreddit.\n\nThe details for this post are in the advanced subreddit.\n\nThey aren't good for beginners to hear, because it'll just dirty your link to intent even more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Real Magic is Cool.

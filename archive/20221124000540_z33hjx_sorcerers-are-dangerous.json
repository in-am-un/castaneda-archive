Stay with the herd because there is safety in numbers, even if you don't know where the actual destination is.\n\n[the actual destination](https://i.redd.it/frquhczl1r1a1.gif)\n\nIn the prey mentality, any individual that substantially dissents either behaviorally or cognitively from the group must be expelled or eliminated, lest they lead others in an unproven direction that **could** harbor a predator.\n\nAs opposed to the direction (humans, for instance) are given to habitually go in, which **definitively** harbors a predator. Death.\n\nDoesn't matter if there may actually be something better (or unexpected) for the herd over there...it's scary, and unproven. A destination that hasn't been agreed-upon by enough authority figures.\n\nThe same vein of authority figures that eons ago somehow convinced enough humans to head down a path, faith, which led to our current disconnect, in order to secure some short term physical gain for themselves.\n\nOr maybe it was just some women that were tired of digging up the odd root and picking the odd berry, and wanted a more reliable food source so they could have more people to commiserate with and better clothes and such.\n\nWho knows for sure...\n\nWhat is apparent is that at the level of matter and individually as well as in small groups, humans are predators. But **at scale** we're very much PREY. And the weapon of fate, lately, is the cumulative consequences of our economic and exploitive actions as a species on this finite planet.\n\nAnd here's where that damnable accountability re-enters the equation. Something which invalidates the haphazardly crafted illusions humans derive safety from. Illusions such as a merciful and benevolent God, that are mostly built upon entirely assumed agreements, and somehow get translated as incontrovertible FACTS.\n\nAnd facts that don't reinforce the penultimate importance and truth of our place in the world, are basically verging on being a capital offense. Or less ominously, a \"mental illness.\"\n\nConversely, those with experience on a truly alternate non-egoic path (sorcery), rather than one that superficially mimics it, correctly deride as insane those who expect to make the same choices and behave as if it's all business as usual, and to have that lead to a different outcome or a righteously averted calamity...as the actual danger.\n\nAnd you don't have to be a sorcerer to see this.

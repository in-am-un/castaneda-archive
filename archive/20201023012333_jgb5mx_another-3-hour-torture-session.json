That does not happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That kind of reaction is the &amp;quot;chip&amp;quot; we have in our heads. The chip our parents and the social thing put on us.

You return where you were when young.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was doing the Zuleica pass and I couldn&amp;#39;t help but be very happy to see the colors around me moving so majestically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just go ahead, and destroy the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/jgb5mx/another_3_hour_torture_session/g9r1m8e/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1603455069.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_jgb5mx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_jgb5mx", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g9qpvnm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g9pj0jn", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "The dogs a shar-pei it\u2019s hard to describe but they\u2019re not like other dogs, google their cat-like behaviour it\u2019s not easy to train them they have free will.

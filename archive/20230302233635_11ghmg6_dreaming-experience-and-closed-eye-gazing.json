A mouse or rat? A very cute rodent that I tried to pick up, but it freaked out and kept trying to get away from me, and eventually bit my finger, which hurt in the dream. I let it go, and moved into the driver's seat. I was about to start the car when I noticed that the windshield was like a hatch, and was partially open. An animal was trapped between the windshield \"hatch\" and the metal frame of the car. I lifted the windshield and rescued the reddish brown animal, that I could now see was a Red Squirrel (very similar to the attached photo). It was such a cute squirrel, that I held it close with lots of love. And another creature came into the car, a bluish-purple puff ball. Hard to describe.

It was a very strange argument but the lady seemed to enjoy it and was egging me on, lol.\n\nSo while I was doing Closed Eye Gazing again and IOB invitation again before going back to sleep, sudden sparkles and pressure came in and I knew that I was getting an answer, but I wanted to make sure that they were Allies. So I asked a few times, and there was absolutely zero response that I could hear.\n\nSo I pushed them away and said I was only going to work with Allies. But they pushed back almost immediately with pressure and a flash of sparkles. And then I could hear them in my head, these little voices like female fairies. And they said \"yes we are Allies.\" And I asked who they were and I got that it was \"Fancy\" and \"Fairy\". (Does \"Fancy\" ever take the form of a fairy? Or sound like a little fairy?) And they were happy that I could understand them now. And I was wondering because they were so nice and they said of course they communicate expectations or something, I didn't quite understand. But I think they meant because I was expecting an Ally, then they were nice.\n\nI was wondering about what you had said about them and I heard the word \"macho\". So I'm not really sure what they meant by that but something about what you said yourself, that you are fine with them being rough and welcome it. And then I got an image in my head of \"you\" being pushed around and them laughing. And they said they like to play. And I realized all of it is play to them.

It was a very strange argument but the lady seemed to enjoy it and was egging me on, lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while I was doing Closed Eye Gazing again and IOB invitation again before going back to sleep, sudden sparkles and pressure came in and I knew that I was getting an answer, but I wanted to make sure that they were Allies. So I asked a few times, and there was absolutely zero response that I could hear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I pushed them away and said I was only going to work with Allies. But they pushed back almost immediately with pressure and a flash of sparkles. And then I could hear them in my head, these little voices like female fairies. And they said &amp;quot;yes we are Allies.&amp;quot; And I asked who they were and I got that it was &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;quot;. (Does &amp;quot;Fancy&amp;quot; ever take the form of a fairy? Or sound like a little fairy?) And they were happy that I could understand them now. And I was wondering because they were so nice and they said of course they communicate expectations or something, I didn&amp;#39;t quite understand. But I think they meant because I was expecting an Ally, then they were nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was wondering about what you had said about them and I heard the word &amp;quot;macho&amp;quot;. So I&amp;#39;m not really sure what they meant by that but something about what you said yourself, that you are fine with them being rough and welcome it. And then I got an image in my head of &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; being pushed around and them laughing. And they said they like to play. And I realized all of it is play to them.

\n\nUsing emotions to control the direction that a regular sleeping dream takes is really useful, but there are many other dream states where we aren't the ones who are really creating things. There's a bit of our inventory mixed in for sure, but the being we are sharing the dream with might be more responsible for creating it.\n\nI've been in many of these and even seen an IOB create one on the fly while I was in it. They can be incredibly crisp and detailed, especially if the IOB is supplying the energy. It's still incredibly important to be able to control your emotions, but these dreams aren't really emotional at their core. They aren't aspects of your subconscious that you are steering. So being in control helps when you are dealing with the IOB but not necessarily in controlling the direction the experience takes (they don't usually have a dreamy narrative to them in the same way as a sleeping dream).\n\nThese are easiest to enter directly from waking. \n\nIn the instance with the IOB from my earlier comment, the 'dream' served a different kind of purpose. I made a couple of mistakes in how I handled it, so at least it is an educational experience. Maybe it's worth recounting it so other people reading can learn from it too.\n\nThe first sign that a spirit was around was a buzzing sound and a pressure moving around my head, which I recognised to be an IOB. I was practicing gazing but I felt tired so I lay down on the couch.\n\nThe buzzing sensation got stronger and I got pulled directly into a state of dreaming. The 'dream' was of the room I was in, seemingly as though I was awake, but my 'partner' was sitting behind me holding their hand around the back of my skull with their thumb and forefinger on either side of my head.\n\nThe physical sensation of touch was incredibly distinctive and realistic. I recognised immediately that it was an IOB. It was telling me that it didn't like me anymore, that it wanted to break up with me, and other things that -if I were to assume it was my partner- would have incited an emotional reaction in me.\n\nI didn't have an emotional reaction because I knew what it was, and from practice in controlling emotions like you said. But my first mistake was not to call it out on what it was doing and try to change the interaction or shoo it away. I just assumed that if I didn't get emotional, then it wouldn't be able to drain me.\n\nI started experimenting with my perception while it was still holding my head. I shifted my attention to my physical body and lifted my neck up. As I moved myself more into my physical sensorium, the sensation of the hand disappeared. I then lowered and shifted myself back into my energy body and the sensation returned as though it had been there all along. I just played around shifting back and forth on the edge between the two for a while before I fell completely asleep.\n\nWhen I awoke I felt awful. My head was ringing, my vision was messed up, and I felt nauseous. It took about an hour to start to feel better.\n\nThe second mistake I made was to assume that the IOB was now gone. In my experience, they usually don't keep coming back unless there's a reason. So I didn't take steps to protect myself from it returning, which would have been easy but aren't effective unless I actually did them!\n\nEach time I tried to practice for about two weeks afterwards I would feel the same way. Nauseous, pounding head, messed up vision. But because I wasn't getting the dream component I didn't connect the dots.\n\nI complained to another spirit worker I know and they pointed out that I was getting drained by a spirit. Which... was a little embarrassing to be honest.\n\nI have no proof that it was Fancy and wouldn't want to trash talk her if it was someone else, but I did specifically ask her to waterboard me and I got what I asked for!\n\nDon't let this weird experience dissuade you. I love IOBs, they're fascinating and relationships with them can be incredibly rewarding. But if you're asking to meet one it might be better that they are told to play nice unless specifically stated otherwise!", "edited": false, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jaueyxw", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think you summarised a little of what my reply was going to be about already! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using emotions to control the direction that a regular sleeping dream takes is really useful, but there are many other dream states where we aren&amp;#39;t the ones who are really creating things.

So being in control helps when you are dealing with the IOB but not necessarily in controlling the direction the experience takes (they don&amp;#39;t usually have a dreamy narrative to them in the same way as a sleeping dream).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are easiest to enter directly from waking. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the instance with the IOB from my earlier comment, the &amp;#39;dream&amp;#39; served a different kind of purpose. I made a couple of mistakes in how I handled it, so at least it is an educational experience. Maybe it&amp;#39;s worth recounting it so other people reading can learn from it too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first sign that a spirit was around was a buzzing sound and a pressure moving around my head, which I recognised to be an IOB. I was practicing gazing but I felt tired so I lay down on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The buzzing sensation got stronger and I got pulled directly into a state of dreaming. The &amp;#39;dream&amp;#39; was of the room I was in, seemingly as though I was awake, but my &amp;#39;partner&amp;#39; was sitting behind me holding their hand around the back of my skull with their thumb and forefinger on either side of my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The physical sensation of touch was incredibly distinctive and realistic. I recognised immediately that it was an IOB. It was telling me that it didn&amp;#39;t like me anymore, that it wanted to break up with me, and other things that -if I were to assume it was my partner- would have incited an emotional reaction in me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t have an emotional reaction because I knew what it was, and from practice in controlling emotions like you said. But my first mistake was not to call it out on what it was doing and try to change the interaction or shoo it away. I just assumed that if I didn&amp;#39;t get emotional, then it wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to drain me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started experimenting with my perception while it was still holding my head. I shifted my attention to my physical body and lifted my neck up. As I moved myself more into my physical sensorium, the sensation of the hand disappeared. I then lowered and shifted myself back into my energy body and the sensation returned as though it had been there all along. I just played around shifting back and forth on the edge between the two for a while before I fell completely asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I awoke I felt awful. My head was ringing, my vision was messed up, and I felt nauseous. It took about an hour to start to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second mistake I made was to assume that the IOB was now gone. In my experience, they usually don&amp;#39;t keep coming back unless there&amp;#39;s a reason. So I didn&amp;#39;t take steps to protect myself from it returning, which would have been easy but aren&amp;#39;t effective unless I actually did them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each time I tried to practice for about two weeks afterwards I would feel the same way. Nauseous, pounding head, messed up vision. But because I wasn&amp;#39;t getting the dream component I didn&amp;#39;t connect the dots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I complained to another spirit worker I know and they pointed out that I was getting drained by a spirit. Which... was a little embarrassing to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no proof that it was Fancy and wouldn&amp;#39;t want to trash talk her if it was someone else, but I did specifically ask her to waterboard me and I got what I asked for!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let this weird experience dissuade you. I love IOBs, they&amp;#39;re fascinating and relationships with them can be incredibly rewarding. But if you&amp;#39;re asking to meet one it might be better that they are told to play nice unless specifically stated otherwise!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_11ghmg6", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/11ghmg6/dreaming_experience_and_closed_eye_gazing/jaueyxw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1677901167.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1677901167.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jatw145", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "morshana", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jattngq", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_akbthl2e", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Yes, I am very, tired, lol.

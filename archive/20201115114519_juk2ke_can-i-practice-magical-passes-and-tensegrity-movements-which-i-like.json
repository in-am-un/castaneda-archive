I have a post about it, in case you'd like to try it.\n\nWhile doing that, I realized it pushes a ball of light around.  Not vague light. Intense purple and pink light, with all sorts of fibers in it.  At any point you can grab it, and compress it with your hands to make it even more spectacular.\n\nDone the way Carlos taught it, there's a little twist of the fingers at the end of each swing of the scooping hand.  A \"flick\" movement.\n\nWhen you do that, the puff is given a little urging to stay in the middle.\n\nIn the middle it is more or less absorbed where the second attention's assemblage point becomes visible.  You have to keep \"feeding\" it with the scooping movements or it fades away.\n\nBut if you remove the flick, the ball doesn't settle in the center.  And it fades much more slowly.\n\nI was watching how far I could go, getting it to move around the room, pushed by my palms.  I realized I was playing a game of \"pong\", the very first video game available to work on your old fashioned TV.\n\nFancy, my inorganic being, decided it looked like fun.\n\nShe rode on the puff.  Not vaguely. Clearly, there was a woman's head glowing on the ball.  With a smile I might add.

I have a post about it, in case you&amp;#39;d like to try it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While doing that, I realized it pushes a ball of light around.  Not vague light. Intense purple and pink light, with all sorts of fibers in it.  At any point you can grab it, and compress it with your hands to make it even more spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Done the way Carlos taught it, there&amp;#39;s a little twist of the fingers at the end of each swing of the scooping hand.  A &amp;quot;flick&amp;quot; movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you do that, the puff is given a little urging to stay in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the middle it is more or less absorbed where the second attention&amp;#39;s assemblage point becomes visible.  You have to keep &amp;quot;feeding&amp;quot; it with the scooping movements or it fades away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you remove the flick, the ball doesn&amp;#39;t settle in the center.  And it fades much more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was watching how far I could go, getting it to move around the room, pushed by my palms.

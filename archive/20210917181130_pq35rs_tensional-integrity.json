Another \"shit smeller\" is bound to come along in a week or two.\n\nIt's the usual stuff they had to complain about, as far as selection of that name goes.\n\nNone of it true, some of it completely ignorant. Such as:\n\n\"Where's Tensegrity in the books???\"\n\nMan. You've got to read better than that. It's all over the books!\n\nHow about this one:\n\n\"Carlos is a man of the 50s and 60s, so he got enamored with Buckminster Fuller. That's why he picked that name.\"\n\nYea, possibly true. And he used to drive by Geodesic dome homes on the way to visiting don Juan in Mexico.\n\nBut he didn't use that name.\n\nReally, the truth is, Tensegrity's effects are so vast you can't even define what it can do.\n\nOnce you can \"see energy\".\n\nAnd when you realize that, you'll see the genius of using that name, \"Tensegrity\".  There might be a better one, but I can't think what it would be.\n\nAnd seeing energy is exactly where Tensegrity leads.\n\nWhen you can get fully silent (mandatory), you just follow the hands as they sweep during a tensegrity move, and feel the \"flow\", while looking for visual disturbances. Allow the flow to help silence the internal dialogue even deeper.\n\nYou really need perfect darkness, if you're new to this. Later, you can even do it in full sunlight, but don't make it harder on yourself.\n\nYou'll begin to see pinkish light and tiny sparkles as the arm disturbs the air.\n\nAnd eventually streaks of pink, purple, yellow, and jet black.\n\nYour arms and body will be moving through visible displays of flowing energy.\n\nThere's where you'll see the \"Tensegrity\" connection.\n\nThe flows of visible energy are like those chains in that picture, which are seemingly attached to only one part of the green bar, but the overall effect ripples through the whole structure and it reaches some kind of equilibrium. It becomes a new \"thing\" that has tension, but also holds together with integrity.\n\nThat \"structure\" will remain in the air a while after you stop, and you can even \"recall\" it the next day. If you don't get too excited and interfere with the intent of it.\n\nAnd it will form a \"tunnel\" you can travel through.\n\nYour tensegrity will do that, if you learn to visually see it! And don't forget to feel for cobwebs and temperature fluctuations.\n\nCobweb practice:  Strip naked and lie in the path of Argentinian ants, so they crawl all over your skin.  It doesn't just \"teach\" you what that feels like. It \"summons\" the intent of finding it later on, without the ants.\n\nWhere does the Tensegrity generated structure lead to?\n\nOut of the room!  Through the solid wall.\n\nBut you'll need some \"help\" for that.  Dark energy.\n\nHow to get the dark energy?\n\nYou need an \"Ally\".  I can't help with that, but you can in fact \"find\" one amidst the Tensegrity displays of visible light.  She'll just be a head, barely discernable, on a patch of pink or purple.  You have to \"woo\" her to become stronger.  And ignore her tricks designed to frighten you!\n\nIf you have one already, and she's helpful, she can give you a \"refueling station\" in your Tensegrity structure.\n\nFrankly, she isn't doing  you a favor, so don't be too grateful. That's exactly where they want you to go, into their world.\n\nSo you can thank her (I do), but don't feel as if she's done you a huge favor!\n\nYou have to watch for her through the Tensegrity \"pass\"(age), but as you are moving around during the long form keep an eye out for a tiny head floating in reddish brown light, which seems to be a cave or tunnel.\n\nYou don't want just her little head to show up. You need her home world.\n\nStop there a bit at the point where you can face a wall in her world and still see her face, and soak it up!\n\nScoop it, pour it, or do anything you need to do to \"feel\" what dark energy is like. \n\nBut don't expect to remember much of it.  Better give yourself a thumbs up to mark the spot.\n\nCharged up like that you'll have what you need to switch to the double.\n\nFor leaving the room.\n\nCan you leave the room without the help of the double?\n\nYes, but that's a \"sideways\" use of Tensegrity.\n\nYour Ally will have to teach it to you, if she finds you ready for it.\n\nEver play \"touch football\", and got in a lucky spin?  Rolled a guy coming at you, by turning around as you trotted along?\n\nThat's one way to do \"sideways travel\" using darkness.\n\nWish I could give you more detail, but doing something once or twice, is a lot different than repeating it daily, and getting more details on it.\n\nWe're probably stuck with \"one-ups\" for a while.  That's what the \"mastery of intent\" really is.\n\nBeing able to repeat things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "\"Tensional Integrity\"?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 105, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ords1fym73o71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 56, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ords1fym73o71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e47abdc0da3aa164efdeef3e3868e691de08a031"}, {"y": 112, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ords1fym73o71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d98e4dbd2d0f0f1e8743f176f557115979da0ca0"}, {"y": 167, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ords1fym73o71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f14306e1979cb54e0f47c6c71a60eaa5271b248"}], "s": {"y": 261, "x": 500, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ords1fym73o71.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b11a26bc373eccaed18fa5dd7a0de2e51c87b834"}, "id": "ords1fym73o71"}}, "name": "t3_pq35rs", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 12, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0onncd0_0-o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 356, "scrolling": false, "height": 200}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": {"oembed": {"provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "title": "Tensegrity Explained", "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0onncd0_0-o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "thumbnail_width": 480, "height": 200, "width": 356, "version": "1.0", "author_name": "Steve Mould", "provider_name": "YouTube", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0onncd0_0-o/hqdefault.jpg", "type": "video", "thumbnail_height": 360, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/c/SteveMould"}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0onncd0_0-o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "width": 356, "scrolling": false, "media_domain_url": "https://www.redditmedia.com/mediaembed/pq35rs", "height": 200}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 12, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_CbgFWZ5Je9b3MM1YFP0OnEUuLzAhYG5AXfIeDKTzwA.jpg", "edited": 1631896917.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1631895090.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ords1fym73o71.png?width=500&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b11a26bc373eccaed18fa5dd7a0de2e51c87b834\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onncd0_0-o &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just liked this picture, because it took me a while to figure out why it seems to be floating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it also made me realize, the reaction half the private classes had about the name &amp;quot;Tensegrity&amp;quot; was tainted with some negativity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose, looking back, half the class had a big chip on their shoulder, and was hoping for &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot; that Carlos didn&amp;#39;t make it up, or proof that he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they went around with their noses up in the air, like they were smelling shit all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least, that&amp;#39;s how Carlos described that attitude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We get it in here too.

They would rate items on the list in categories, but don Juan was continually shuffling them around. The old nagual traumatized. That was the traditional way of training initiates for continuing the lineage.\n\n\"Not-Doing is not overt. It is the interruption of the flow of our natural energy,\" she explained. \"The old nagual did weird things with that interruption.\"\n\nCarol had her own way of categorizing his antics.

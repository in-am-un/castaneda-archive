It's an activity Taisha has said is ok.\n\nNormally, you don't want to do that sort of thing.  Believing you can \"improve\" on what we were given, is the biggest mistake beginners make.  All of their lives they've been taught that you learn things, through practice.  And as they learned, they found that you get better each day.\n\nSo if you could throw your ball and hit  your target one in 10 times last time you played, the next time you have a chance for twice in 10 times. And so on.\n\nSorcery is the opposite.  Whatever you do this time, you'll do worse the next day.\n\nWhy?\n\nIf you have to ask that, you really need to do some reading in here.\n\nThat is, if you actually want to learn.\n\nSorcery isn't about your wonderful talents and skills.\n\nIt's not about learning either.  It's about \"unlearning\".\n\nAnd it's certainly not about what you learned in other \"systems\", which you can apply here, to be faster than everyone else.\n\nBelieving that means, you're doomed. Might as well go elsewhere and get some \"guru assistant\" to flatter you, and promise to teach you in lessons, for a small fee of course.\n\nSorcery isn't like that at all.\n\nBut fortunately, over time you do learn to repeat things you did.  As don Juan said, \"Your command becomes the Eagle's command.\"\n\nBut that takes a very long time.\n\nUp until then, the best practice is to just take what you get each day, and not seek to repeat.  Save energy, live right, and just enjoy the actual magic you get to see with your own eyes.\n\nDon't tell the cook (*intent*) that you want cheese fries again.\n\nYou'll confuse him.  He already has your food planned for the night, and when you suggest you won't be  happy with it he just goes away and leaves you alone in the kitchen, to try to do it yourself.\n\nWhich you can't.  You'll just end up with a sink filled with dirty dishes.\n\nWhat you see in this picture happened 2 nights after I messed up, and decided to plan things myself.\n\nI'd been neglecting Fancy, my \"sliding dreaming\" instructor.\n\nShe's the master of horizontal shifting.  IOBs love that, because you are only \"yourself\" in the middle.\n\nIf they shift you horizontally, they can control nearly everything about you.\n\nMood, personality, rationality, and even your shape.\n\nHorizontal shifting causes shape shifting of one form or the other.\n\nIn the red zone, it literally allows you to turn into animals.\n\nBut before you get ideas about punking your friends, take a closer look at those Olmec statues.\n\nThey tell the truth of the situation.\n\nNotice the miniature man on the lap of the sorcerer?\n\nLook closer. He's a werejaguar.\n\nThe Olmec specialized in werejaguars.  We know, because those show up in their art, over and over.\n\nThose are the guys who gave us all the shapeshifting our lineage knows.\n\nVia the death defier.\n\nEvery wonder why he's around 8000 years old? Or how don Juan and Carlos were pretty sure our magic is 10,000 years old?\n\nIt's him!\n\nBecause he's from 1000-2000 years after the \"origin\" of our sorcery.  10,000 years ago.\n\nHe got trapped in the inorganic being's realm, with all the knowledge of the old seers.\n\nThen he escaped, and that's how our lineage learned to turn into a crow, a wolf, and a fly.\n\nSo look closely at those statues, and notice that the man himself is not shapeshifted.\n\nBut his double is.\n\nIf you've shapeshifted, you've already been puzzled about how you ended up in an empty world.\n\nYou change over to some kind of beast, go outside, everything is perfectly normal, except there's no one around.\n\nThere's why.\n\nWe shapeshift in our doubles, not in our tonal body.\n\nWhich is very fortunate.\n\nUnless you like to play pranks on people.\n\nThe same happens when Cholita walks through my solid bedroom walls, to play in her double.\n\nI seriously doubt anyone else could see it.\n\nI hope whoever the wealthy people are, that are now taking care of Cholita, are capable of moving their assemblage points.  It's such a waste of stupendous magic if they can't.\n\nEven the Nagual Julian could not get don Juan to perceive his allies, without tapping him repeatedly on the back.\n\nWe reject those sights, when the assemblage point is in the blue zone.  You'll get to see that with your own eyes, once you can move it.  You'll hit an \"in-between\" spot, and catch yourself ignoring obvious magic.\n\nIt's weird.  It's  not that it's invisible.\n\nWe simply suppress the view, or even just the memory of it.\n\nBut you don't have to take my word for any of this. And please, NEVER DO!\n\nWe get new people in here who literally make up stuff, to get attention.\n\nOr they repeat stuff they found on a bad man's web page, obviously made up to get attention.\n\nAnd they actually bring it here!\n\nDon't do that...\n\nThe only refuge of magic left on earth, and you're going to harm it?\n\nInsist on seeing things for yourself.  And never add to it.\n\nAlways doing it yourself if possible. But if it's some \"new information\", insist on seeing where they got that info.\n\nIf some guy is completely naive about sorcery, and claims to know how to reach the 3rd attention (what darkroom is designed for!), just ask him to show where he got the info.\n\nPoint you to it. So you can see yourself.\n\nThey'll never be able to show you even a single reasonable source.  And if they claim they discovered it, ask them to show you why they believe they have any sorcery knowledge at all.\n\nThey can't!\n\nOne famous bad guy on Facebook likes to say don Juan showed him magic in dreaming. When asked how he knows it's don Juan and not just a dream phantom,  he says because he can see energy.\n\nThey always keep going to tire you out, so you'll stop asking them to prove their lies.\n\nNever stop!  Don't let that go on.  If they end up with an obvious nutty story like because they can see energy, ask them to tell you how they learned to do that, and what exactly they encountered during the process?\n\nAnd why their method to \"see energy\" doesn't agree with what Carlos wrote, in his final publications.\n\nIt won't!  You can be sure of that.\n\nOr are they so talented, there was no learning process?\n\nThey get angry and run when you do that. They're after attention.\n\nNot blame.\n\nIt's a world of make believe out there, and no one seems to be sober enough to insist on seeing the details.\n\nSobriety is the very attribute \"warriorship\" is supposed to foster, but somehow those who emphasize that most, are the least sober among us.\n\nThis picture is not intended to show you some techniques you can try out.\n\nThat's impossible.\n\nIt's just to show you some guidelines, for where your assemblage point has moved to.\n\nIn the deep orange zone waking dreaming is still possible, but the nature of the dreams changes.\n\nAnd the double becomes your friend.\n\nMore interesting is that Olmec statues start to make more sense.\n\nNow, about being stuck horizontally shifted, from playing too much with Fancy.\n\nThat was 3 nights ago.\n\nTwo nights ago, I put in a marathon practice session, possibly 12 hours. It was the weekend.\n\nBut it was horrible.  Playing with Fancy had shifted my assemblage point to the right, and it didn't return to the middle.\n\nI had spent so much time moving my assemblage point, that it was surely going to be beneficial.\n\nEventually.\n\nBut not on the day I put in that time.\n\nA good rule:  The harder the night, the more eventual progress.  If the worst case bad night happens, concentrate entirely on silence.\n\nIn this case, I got lucky.\n\nSomeone \"rescued\" me the next night.\n\nA man. In dull white.  Could have been Mexican peasant clothes.\n\nI was so far out on the orange part of the J curve, I barely remembered it.\n\nA man materialized in the south eastern corner of my darkroom, where Little Smoke had burned a passage  years ago.\n\nThe man opened a closet door. Except that I have no closet in that part of the room, and it was absolutely pitch black.  No way to see such a thing.\n\nI don't remember the conversation anymore, but it was something like, \"Here's your problem.  Up here, on the top shelf.  Hey, move back, this is going to get messy!\"\n\nHe reached up there, pulled out a box, dropped it on the floor, and the entire contents of the top of the \"closet\" spilled out onto my darkroom floor.\n\nI tried to look to see what was left, but now it was just a black hole at the top of a closet that didn't exist.\n\nSatisfied, I returned to my darkroom practice. Instantly forgetting I'd just been \"rescued\".\n\nI had the most amazing night I can remember.\n\nWish I could both remember it all, and find the time to draw it.\n\nStuff was so vivid and real, I kept trying to figure out who I could thank for it.\n\nI've been watching a little too much Walker, Texas Ranger.   It's from the heyday of Castaneda popularity, and they have several wise \"don Juan\" type characters on the show.\n\nApparently native Americans like it too, because one of  our recent \"shamanism\" attackers used it in his user name.\n\nSo I did what they did.  I thanked, \"the great spirit\".\n\nI'm still not fond of that show's screeching eagle.\n\nI have Cholita's sharp samurai sword waiting in case it shows up in my darkroom.\n\nUnfortunately for us, unlike Carlos we don't have a don Juan to thank when we experience real magic.\n\nThat may actually be a problem.  But you'll have to get to the deep orange zone before you need to think about such things.\n\nA week or so ago someone decided to post more \"worry\".\n\nHe was one of those, \"look what I found\" types,  cross bred with a \"warner\" type.\n\nSome people won't actually do any work, so they \"share\", and \"warn\", and generally do anything they can think of, to remind others there in here too.\n\nEven if they aren't actually going to do some work to learn.\n\nAs long as there's not too many, it's no problem.\n\nExcept for them.\n\nSo the point is, when Carlos got stuck in the IOB realm trying to free the blue scout, and had to be rescued by Carol Tiggs, one might think, \"But I'm alone.  What if I get stuck?\"\n\nExcept, who said you were alone?\n\nRemember the \"river of shit\" story.\n\nSorcerers are waiting on the shore to hose you off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [],

And please, NEVER DO!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We get new people in here who literally make up stuff, to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or they repeat stuff they found on a bad man&amp;#39;s web page, obviously made up to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they actually bring it here!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t do that...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only refuge of magic left on earth, and you&amp;#39;re going to harm it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Insist on seeing things for yourself.  And never add to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always doing it yourself if possible. But if it&amp;#39;s some &amp;quot;new information&amp;quot;, insist on seeing where they got that info.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If some guy is completely naive about sorcery, and claims to know how to reach the 3rd attention (what darkroom is designed for!), just ask him to show where he got the info.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Point you to it. So you can see yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll never be able to show you even a single reasonable source.  And if they claim they discovered it, ask them to show you why they believe they have any sorcery knowledge at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can&amp;#39;t!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One famous bad guy on Facebook likes to say don Juan showed him magic in dreaming. When asked how he knows it&amp;#39;s don Juan and not just a dream phantom,  he says because he can see energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They always keep going to tire you out, so you&amp;#39;ll stop asking them to prove their lies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never stop!  Don&amp;#39;t let that go on.  If they end up with an obvious nutty story like because they can see energy, ask them to tell you how they learned to do that, and what exactly they encountered during the process?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And why their method to &amp;quot;see energy&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t agree with what Carlos wrote, in his final publications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t!  You can be sure of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or are they so talented, there was no learning process?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They get angry and run when you do that. They&amp;#39;re after attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not blame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a world of make believe out there, and no one seems to be sober enough to insist on seeing the details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sobriety is the very attribute &amp;quot;warriorship&amp;quot; is supposed to foster, but somehow those who emphasize that most, are the least sober among us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This picture is not intended to show you some techniques you can try out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just to show you some guidelines, for where your assemblage point has moved to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the deep orange zone waking dreaming is still possible, but the nature of the dreams changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the double becomes your friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More interesting is that Olmec statues start to make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, about being stuck horizontally shifted, from playing too much with Fancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was 3 nights ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two nights ago, I put in a marathon practice session, possibly 12 hours. It was the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was horrible.  Playing with Fancy had shifted my assemblage point to the right, and it didn&amp;#39;t return to the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had spent so much time moving my assemblage point, that it was surely going to be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not on the day I put in that time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good rule:  The harder the night, the more eventual progress.  If the worst case bad night happens, concentrate entirely on silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case, I got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone &amp;quot;rescued&amp;quot; me the next night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A man. In dull white.  Could have been Mexican peasant clothes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so far out on the orange part of the J curve, I barely remembered it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A man materialized in the south eastern corner of my darkroom, where Little Smoke had burned a passage  years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man opened a closet door. Except that I have no closet in that part of the room, and it was absolutely pitch black.  No way to see such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember the conversation anymore, but it was something like, &amp;quot;Here&amp;#39;s your problem.  Up here, on the top shelf.  Hey, move back, this is going to get messy!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He reached up there, pulled out a box, dropped it on the floor, and the entire contents of the top of the &amp;quot;closet&amp;quot; spilled out onto my darkroom floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to look to see what was left, but now it was just a black hole at the top of a closet that didn&amp;#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Satisfied, I returned to my darkroom practice. Instantly forgetting I&amp;#39;d just been &amp;quot;rescued&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the most amazing night I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wish I could both remember it all, and find the time to draw it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stuff was so vivid and real, I kept trying to figure out who I could thank for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been watching a little too much Walker, Texas Ranger.   It&amp;#39;s from the heyday of Castaneda popularity, and they have several wise &amp;quot;don Juan&amp;quot; type characters on the show.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently native Americans like it too, because one of  our recent &amp;quot;shamanism&amp;quot; attackers used it in his user name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I did what they did.  I thanked, &amp;quot;the great spirit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still not fond of that show&amp;#39;s screeching eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have Cholita&amp;#39;s sharp samurai sword waiting in case it shows up in my darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for us, unlike Carlos we don&amp;#39;t have a don Juan to thank when we experience real magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That may actually be a problem.  But you&amp;#39;ll have to get to the deep orange zone before you need to think about such things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A week or so ago someone decided to post more &amp;quot;worry&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was one of those, &amp;quot;look what I found&amp;quot; types,  cross bred with a &amp;quot;warner&amp;quot; type.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people won&amp;#39;t actually do any work, so they &amp;quot;share&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;warn&amp;quot;, and generally do anything they can think of, to remind others there in here too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if they aren&amp;#39;t actually going to do some work to learn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as there&amp;#39;s not too many, it&amp;#39;s no problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the point is, when Carlos got stuck in the IOB realm trying to free the blue scout, and had to be rescued by Carol Tiggs, one might think, &amp;quot;But I&amp;#39;m alone.  What if I get stuck?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, who said you were alone?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember the &amp;quot;river of shit&amp;quot; story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorcerers are waiting on the shore to hose you off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "acff1442-e63e-11ea-b305-0e375464469b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "rb5o0q", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 8, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/rb5o0q/waking_dreaming_in_the_deep_orange_zone/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/rb5o0q/waking_dreaming_in_the_deep_orange_zone/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1638901612.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hnna3s0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1638915355.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hnmx4de", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "You can get to the green zone with meditation.

But the being is.\n\n\"The Eagle\" wants to know about reality.\n\nHe's like my sock puppet picture, where I inserted \"Fancy\" into a London street at night.\n\nHe inserts us into reality, to see what it's like in there.\n\nMy guess is that each egg can explore the dark sea of awareness until it sees a world it likes, and then it gets stuck there.\n\nIt \"takes a birth\".\n\nI'm not sure there's a choice.  Carlos made it seem like we had one and made the wrong choice.   But it seems to me like the eggs are actually seeds.\n\nSo the Eagle fills an egg with certain of those trillions of luminous fibers, and that egg can only perceive or interact with that portion of reality, which has some representation inside that being's egg.\n\nWe have only a very small overlap with the IOBs, so we can never perceive their world the way they do.\n\nProbably the same for them, although they're far more powerful than we are. They might have figured out a way to \"borrow\" our view of our world, so they can perceive it that way too.\n\nI suspect the tendency on hearing about them, is to think they're like us but alien.\n\nThey aren't.  We're so different, if you found an inorganic being in it's native form sitting on a shelf in an antique store, you wouldn't even find it interesting enough to pick up.\n\nThey look like Mexican prayer candles with flat sides.\n\nWhat we perceive as a demon or fairy,  is a projection.  A \"pressure\" coming from them, which causes micro vibrations in our emanations.\n\nWe interpret those.\n\nYou can of course interact with them as if they were 100% real, just like any friend you have.\n\nBut you have to be in the double to do that.\n\nNot the double that's come out into this copy of reality.\n\nAny version works.\n\nSo if you fall asleep after playing with them for hours in the evening, you can be sure they're in your dreams.  Probably the first one you have.\n\nOr, if you can bring the double out into the \"real\" world, your IOB can be 100% real here too.\n\nMy suspicion:  Sorcerers can combine the two...  But I have no proof of that.\n\nThe range of things you can do with IOBs is nearly unlimited.\n\nIf I were a super killed sorcerer, I could probably get my 3 allies to put on a floor show for me.\n\nVicente got his 3 allies to show up for Carlos in full daylight, with a fake broken down car, and Carlos did not realize they were inorganic beings.\n\nLike the stories don Juan told, of IOBs riding around on busses, like they were real people going about their lives.\n\nBut for us, they're not particularly real looking most of the time.\n\nIn dreaming, a \"floor show\" would be absolutely real, and even have stage props.\n\nIn the darkroom, you'll be lucky to get them side by side at the same time.\n\nMaybe you need one of your own so you can ask them questions?\n\nThey always answer.  It just takes so long sometimes, you don't realize they did it.\n\nAnd most times, the answer is non-verbal.  And unfathomable.\n\nLet's say you ask one  a question, and she just fades away.\n\nThen 3 days later you're peacefully gazing at energy on your bedspread, and a crate of oranges falls from the ceiling onto the bed.\n\nI mean, a real crate falls, and even bounces the bed a bit.\n\nNaturally if that can happen, you're silent. So instead of running out of the room to call the orange police, you just notice it.\n\nYou think, \"Oh bother.  What's that doing here?  Do I have to move to find out?\"\n\nYou examine the orange crate more closely, and there's a woman with a hat made out of oranges on the box. She winks at you.\n\nQuestion answered...\n\nThen you notice, she has unibrow...\n\nThat would be Cholita's influence.\n\nShe's a big fan of Freida Kahlo.\n\nOne time I was walking behind Cholita in a Trader Joes.\n\nShe stopped, turned around, and told me she's not going to shave her mustache.  She's not a slave anymore.\n\nShe insisted I look very closely at her upper lip.  Turned her head twice, to let me see it with different lighting.\n\nI commented, \"Ok.  That's good enough for Freida.\"\n\nCholita was satisfied with that answer.", "edited": 1633204152.0, "gildings": {}, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hf4tyva", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Eagle&amp;quot; makes &amp;quot;eggs&amp;quot; filled with all ranges of emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Olmec sorcerers didn&amp;#39;t have much to work with, and saw an &amp;quot;Eagle&amp;quot; when they tried to see the source of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d probably see a topless Britney Spears Twerking,  or maybe a scolding Black Lives Matter representative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the Olmec didn&amp;#39;t have social media, so they &amp;quot;recognized&amp;quot; an eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now we&amp;#39;re stuck with that interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like the IOBs, the appearance is not real.

But it seems to me like the eggs are actually seeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the Eagle fills an egg with certain of those trillions of luminous fibers, and that egg can only perceive or interact with that portion of reality, which has some representation inside that being&amp;#39;s egg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have only a very small overlap with the IOBs, so we can never perceive their world the way they do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably the same for them, although they&amp;#39;re far more powerful than we are. They might have figured out a way to &amp;quot;borrow&amp;quot; our view of our world, so they can perceive it that way too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect the tendency on hearing about them, is to think they&amp;#39;re like us but alien.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;#39;t.  We&amp;#39;re so different, if you found an inorganic being in it&amp;#39;s native form sitting on a shelf in an antique store, you wouldn&amp;#39;t even find it interesting enough to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They look like Mexican prayer candles with flat sides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we perceive as a demon or fairy,  is a projection.  A &amp;quot;pressure&amp;quot; coming from them, which causes micro vibrations in our emanations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We interpret those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can of course interact with them as if they were 100% real, just like any friend you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to be in the double to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the double that&amp;#39;s come out into this copy of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any version works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you fall asleep after playing with them for hours in the evening, you can be sure they&amp;#39;re in your dreams.  Probably the first one you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, if you can bring the double out into the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; world, your IOB can be 100% real here too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My suspicion:  Sorcerers can combine the two...  But I have no proof of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The range of things you can do with IOBs is nearly unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were a super killed sorcerer, I could probably get my 3 allies to put on a floor show for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vicente got his 3 allies to show up for Carlos in full daylight, with a fake broken down car, and Carlos did not realize they were inorganic beings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the stories don Juan told, of IOBs riding around on busses, like they were real people going about their lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for us, they&amp;#39;re not particularly real looking most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In dreaming, a &amp;quot;floor show&amp;quot; would be absolutely real, and even have stage props.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the darkroom, you&amp;#39;ll be lucky to get them side by side at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you need one of your own so you can ask them questions?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They always answer.  It just takes so long sometimes, you don&amp;#39;t realize they did it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And most times, the answer is non-verbal.  And unfathomable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you ask one  a question, and she just fades away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then 3 days later you&amp;#39;re peacefully gazing at energy on your bedspread, and a crate of oranges falls from the ceiling onto the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean, a real crate falls, and even bounces the bed a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally if that can happen, you&amp;#39;re silent. So instead of running out of the room to call the orange police, you just notice it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You think, &amp;quot;Oh bother.  What&amp;#39;s that doing here?  Do I have to move to find out?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You examine the orange crate more closely, and there&amp;#39;s a woman with a hat made out of oranges on the box. She winks at you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Question answered...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you notice, she has unibrow...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That would be Cholita&amp;#39;s influence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s a big fan of Freida Kahlo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One time I was walking behind Cholita in a Trader Joes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stopped, turned around, and told me she&amp;#39;s not going to shave her mustache.  She&amp;#39;s not a slave anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She insisted I look very closely at her upper lip.  Turned her head twice, to let me see it with different lighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I commented, &amp;quot;Ok.  That&amp;#39;s good enough for Freida.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita was satisfied with that answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_pzv2o9", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/pzv2o9/what_in_the_works_of_castaneda_is_considered_a/hf4tyva/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1633203318.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1633203318.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 6, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hf4khg9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Eddy1670", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hf49czq", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_1qsg3hlq", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Makes sense!

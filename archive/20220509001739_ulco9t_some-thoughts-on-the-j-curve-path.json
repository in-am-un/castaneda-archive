But not in the storyteller fashion, where it never ends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which seems to be what you&amp;#39;re describing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeing&lt;/em&gt; the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, the J curve sucks! It&amp;#39;s like visiting your Aunt, and all she cooks is macrobiotic food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t we follow a &amp;quot;zig zag&amp;quot; curve?  Going back and forth from magical view to magical view, all horizontally shifted, but you don&amp;#39;t get stuck.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You simply &amp;quot;zig-zag&amp;quot; along the J.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe, that&amp;#39;s what the Tensegrity is designed to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of just &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; moving along the J curve, carefully staying in the middle so you can move the furthest, you get a huge &amp;quot;energetic structure&amp;quot; encasing you, and move along the J curve in that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except you have to already be at the end of the J curve, to perceive that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what Carlos actually expected us to experience. He might have thought the &amp;quot;Tensegrity structure&amp;quot; would stir up magic, trying to move it&amp;#39;s hulking size through the tiny middle portion of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ulco9t/some_thoughts_on_the_j_curve_path/i7xcq25/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1652108112.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_ulco9t", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i8emn5b", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "BodiesWithoutOrgans", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i8ecvjt", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_lr6e2b50", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That may be why people say things like \u201crunning in circles\u201d; the essence of the statement harbors an implicit unverticality within its context.

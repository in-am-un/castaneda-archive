With fantastic results.\n\nBut he was sad I didn't follow him instead of asking a question. He seems to have taken that as a sign.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/jt41jy/fancys\\_new\\_game\\_in\\_and\\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/jt41jy/fancys_new_game_in_and_out/)\n\n\\&gt; asleep\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_asleep\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Needed an IB or two\n\nYES, brilliant!!  You can learn to have them follow you as dreaming scouts. I used to have a little girl and her small dog.\n\nI guarantee, you could order them to bring you into a specific person's dream, and if it was active they could take you there.\n\nI never thought of it.\n\nBut if you want the sleeping dreams of other people, you can just wait around for them to materialize near you, at 3AM.  I've had as many as 4 in the room, probably all from neighbors. They're random though.\n\nTo find a specific one, would surely take an IOB. Space (and time?) means nothing to them.\n\nIf you haven't noticed, IOBs commonly come in pairs.  Don Juan's 2, Genaro's 2, Taisha's 2 (pheobus and globus).  And my 2 (Fancy and Mystery).\n\nIt's important to name them.\n\nBut Vicente had 3, as did the 4 sorcerers at the rock who tried to drain people using fear.  Each had 3.  So I conclude, 3 might be the energetic limit where they don't want to hang out anymore.\n\nCholita has had as many as 5 at a time, but really several were mine. They just like her better.\n\nBy the way, they easily become both solid, and visible in full daylight. Not in such outlandish forms, but Cholita's are visible as balls of light (looks like smoke) and can move objects.\n\n\\&gt;  to bring my dream locale into waking dreaming, I assume the mechanics are similar enough to figure it out with a little practice and experimentation.\n\nYou mean, the virtual world you're making?\n\nI'm afraid to say, if you learn to do waking dreaming that well you'll find so much else to do that you'll forget about that. I've been trying to \"decorate\" my virtual room for more than a week now, but I get too distracted with other magic.\n\nRight now you have fantastic dreaming experiences, \"once in a while\".  But just wait until you have those for hours each and every single night. It kind of changes your priority.\n\nYou want to know, \"What's behind this\", rather than how to do an individual thing.\n\nSomewhere below the red line on the J curve, is the ideal place for intercepting dreams.   Possibly, the lowest point it can move to along the J curve.  But we don't have enough waking dreamers  yet, to fully map it out.\n\nAs for the mechanics of making a virtual world, yes they are like the witches books described. One object at a time.\n\nBut you can also do it the way Carlos taught, by \"seeing energy on a horizon\".  In that case, the world just \"assembles\" on the walls of your room.\n\nThose are real worlds containing energy, or you wouldn't have found them.  They start from \"seeing energy\".\n\nBut if you assemble a distorted view of one, such as back in the 1950s, you can keep that and modify it, and do what you're after.\n\nAnd they are VERY stable. Cholita has a paradise of virtual rooms.  It started with an accident involving an IOB, then she had a copy of her 7/8ths of our home.  She hides in her part.  I visited fully awake, and found her playing with one of the inorganic beings Carlos left to  us. Over time she's added more and more rooms.  It now stretches all the way to Long Beach (30 miles).\n\nI was a little worried to be seeing that, mostly worried no one would believe it,  until someone read Taisha's new book and they did the same.\n\nIt's very nice to discover something, then read about it afterwards!\n\nSo I tried to add my own on.  To Cholita's phantom house.\n\nThat's another way to do it.  Add on to an existing place.\n\nYou just get into HA, then lean down to the floor, and reach out into the phantom room nearest. And pull the floor over.\n\nDumb, but it works.\n\nThen you get to decorate. It starts out empty, but with a weird energetic path to the rest of the house.  It's own, \"space\" perhaps.\n\nCyclic beings?  Carlos explained in class, referring to a 1960s style beaded curtain, perhaps one in the kitchen where Ellis lived.  At any rate, when he used that analogy, Ellis smiled (Amy Wallace).\n\nWe exist on a string of beads. Each bead is an \"us\".  We typically get stuck in a single one shortly after birth, but each of the 600 on that string is available to us as an alternative.  We can't jump strings, but we can jump beads on the same string.\n\nThey are REAL worlds. And we can body snatch each being.  It's likely how the death defier ended up in Carol. They found a way to merge. But the death defier could easily have taken her over.  They are on the same strand.\n\nYou just move up or down the string to the next bead. And you become that person, with all of their memories.\n\nNow here's the key point for you: There are MANY types of dreaming.\n\nEach one has different characteristics.  You can identify which type you are in, by looking at those.\n\nI never charted it out, but it could be charted.\n\nIn the case of cyclic being worlds, these are the key characteristics.\n\nYou enter using silence, while fully awake.  The entry is dramatic and instant.  You can return if you don't stay more than a few seconds. If you stay more than a few seconds, you probably have to wait until you return naturally.\n\nOn entry, you occasionally get to break the laws of physics. Other times, you just turn your head to enter.\n\nThe world is absolutely stable.  There are no IOBs bothering  you.  I suppose there could be, but it's not a place that's easy for them to show up, because it has it's own real energy. They have the same problem being visible there, that they do here.\n\nYou can remain for weeks if you like.  Absolutely stable the whole time.  But there's danger of getting trapped. You forget where you came from.\n\nIf you learn waking dreaming, I can teach you how to enter those.", "edited": 1614701047.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gpf7b8l", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It seems that nearly everything in AoD is sleeping dreaming,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But almost nothing in the other books.

And my 2 (Fancy and Mystery).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to name them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Vicente had 3, as did the 4 sorcerers at the rock who tried to drain people using fear.  Each had 3.  So I conclude, 3 might be the energetic limit where they don&amp;#39;t want to hang out anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita has had as many as 5 at a time, but really several were mine. They just like her better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, they easily become both solid, and visible in full daylight. Not in such outlandish forms, but Cholita&amp;#39;s are visible as balls of light (looks like smoke) and can move objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;  to bring my dream locale into waking dreaming, I assume the mechanics are similar enough to figure it out with a little practice and experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You mean, the virtual world you&amp;#39;re making?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid to say, if you learn to do waking dreaming that well you&amp;#39;ll find so much else to do that you&amp;#39;ll forget about that. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to &amp;quot;decorate&amp;quot; my virtual room for more than a week now, but I get too distracted with other magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now you have fantastic dreaming experiences, &amp;quot;once in a while&amp;quot;.  But just wait until you have those for hours each and every single night. It kind of changes your priority.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want to know, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s behind this&amp;quot;, rather than how to do an individual thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere below the red line on the J curve, is the ideal place for intercepting dreams.   Possibly, the lowest point it can move to along the J curve.  But we don&amp;#39;t have enough waking dreamers  yet, to fully map it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the mechanics of making a virtual world, yes they are like the witches books described. One object at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can also do it the way Carlos taught, by &amp;quot;seeing energy on a horizon&amp;quot;.  In that case, the world just &amp;quot;assembles&amp;quot; on the walls of your room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are real worlds containing energy, or you wouldn&amp;#39;t have found them.  They start from &amp;quot;seeing energy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you assemble a distorted view of one, such as back in the 1950s, you can keep that and modify it, and do what you&amp;#39;re after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they are VERY stable. Cholita has a paradise of virtual rooms.  It started with an accident involving an IOB, then she had a copy of her 7/8ths of our home.  She hides in her part.  I visited fully awake, and found her playing with one of the inorganic beings Carlos left to  us. Over time she&amp;#39;s added more and more rooms.  It now stretches all the way to Long Beach (30 miles).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a little worried to be seeing that, mostly worried no one would believe it,  until someone read Taisha&amp;#39;s new book and they did the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very nice to discover something, then read about it afterwards!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I tried to add my own on.  To Cholita&amp;#39;s phantom house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s another way to do it.  Add on to an existing place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just get into HA, then lean down to the floor, and reach out into the phantom room nearest. And pull the floor over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dumb, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you get to decorate. It starts out empty, but with a weird energetic path to the rest of the house.  It&amp;#39;s own, &amp;quot;space&amp;quot; perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cyclic beings?  Carlos explained in class, referring to a 1960s style beaded curtain, perhaps one in the kitchen where Ellis lived.  At any rate, when he used that analogy, Ellis smiled (Amy Wallace).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We exist on a string of beads. Each bead is an &amp;quot;us&amp;quot;.  We typically get stuck in a single one shortly after birth, but each of the 600 on that string is available to us as an alternative.  We can&amp;#39;t jump strings, but we can jump beads on the same string.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are REAL worlds. And we can body snatch each being.  It&amp;#39;s likely how the death defier ended up in Carol. They found a way to merge. But the death defier could easily have taken her over.  They are on the same strand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You just move up or down the string to the next bead. And you become that person, with all of their memories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s the key point for you: There are MANY types of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each one has different characteristics.  You can identify which type you are in, by looking at those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never charted it out, but it could be charted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of cyclic being worlds, these are the key characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You enter using silence, while fully awake.  The entry is dramatic and instant.  You can return if you don&amp;#39;t stay more than a few seconds. If you stay more than a few seconds, you probably have to wait until you return naturally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On entry, you occasionally get to break the laws of physics. Other times, you just turn your head to enter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world is absolutely stable.  There are no IOBs bothering  you.  I suppose there could be, but it&amp;#39;s not a place that&amp;#39;s easy for them to show up, because it has it&amp;#39;s own real energy. They have the same problem being visible there, that they do here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can remain for weeks if you like.  Absolutely stable the whole time.  But there&amp;#39;s danger of getting trapped. You forget where you came from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you learn waking dreaming, I can teach you how to enter those.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_lv0lua", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/lv0lua/the_house_is_built_from_memories/gpf7b8l/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1614698259.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1614698259.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gpd6i78", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "the-mad-prophet", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1614648138.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gpad3vh", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4dz9kepm", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Thank you for your thoughtful reply.

I haven't discussed it much.  I don't like people to obsess over lucid dreaming, for reasons well known in here.   In fact, you might even say, I'm famously grumpy about that topic.\n\nAs was Carlos!  Cholita could tell you a story about that...\n\nThere's also a tendency to confuse waking dreaming with sleeping dreaming in accounts in the books.\n\nPeople sort of gloss over the accounts, excited to hear it's possible, and try it out the only way they understood it to be in the books: sleeping dreaming.  But in fact, I can't think of any successes at shared dreaming, from the books, where both parties were asleep.\n\nLet's make a truth table, and I'll comment on each combination, from my own experiences, what I remember from the books, and what I heard Carlos say in class.\n\ndwake = dreaming awake\n\nHA = heightened awareness\n\nPerson 1\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Person 2\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Possibilities\n\nasleep\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_asleep\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Poor.

Unlikely &gt; 10% overlap.\n\nawake\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_awake\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Dreaming doubles can share if proximity and one is sorcerer.\n\ndwake\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_asleep\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Person 2 may visit in double.

Can't find 2 at same time.\n\nSo the easiest possibility is if one person is dreaming awake, the other is asleep, and the sleeping person is either nearby, or has a strong bond with the dreaming awake person. The dreaming awake person can notice they've come around in dreaming, follow them, or grab the person to get them to notice you.  I once chased Cholita across 2 continents trying to catch up without having to grab her (she forbid me).\n\nCarlos tried the awake-awake type in class. Nyei even comments on it in a video interview.  She said Carlos would \"speak to their...\"  I can't recall what words she used, but she meant, Carlos was capable of talking to their dreaming body.   But instead of sounding bad-ass and convincing the people watching the interview, it comes off as Nyei is delusional and won't give up the obvious fraud.\n\nNotice one is a dreaming double (the sorcerer), the other is dreaming body. The difference is, the dreaming body is dispersed and needs to be gathered to the middle, to make it into a potentially solid body. Tensegrity does that. Those purple puffs are likely  part of the dream double's body.  At least, \"Fancy\" claims that.  She's my bad-girl inorganic being.\n\nCarlos explained this a few times in private classes, and even at a workshop.  He pointed to his right side and said that with some people their dreaming double is, \"right there!\"  And so a sorcerer can gain access.  That makes those people  more useful to a sorcerer.\n\nNormally the dreaming double of a random person is wandering around in infinity, and finding it is very unlikely. When that's not the case, you have the reason a sorcerer might take an interest in a specific person.  Carlos did.  It was possible to teach them more easily.\n\nSo if you have people around who's dreaming double comes near to you, because their waking body is near, you can access it if you are a sorcerer.\n\nBut at one large workshop where he was explaining this \"double right there!\",  there were only 2 of those in the entire workshop.  And neither had a clue who they were.\n\nCholita is like that, which makes sharing dreaming with her easy.  She visited me tonight in her dreaming double, possibly to check up on the results of a spell she has going.  Meaning, her double was curious, so I got a visit.\n\nCholita likes food spells, inside containers.  Several times I found an irresistible food item carefully placed on the top of the trash in the bin.  The spell is under that.  Some quite gruesome.\n\nSo you open the trash and you say to yourself, \"I wonder who threw away this perfectly good delicious unopened packet of Champurrado???\"\n\nYou reach in, get the Champurrado, and the spell somehow goes into  you.  Don't ask me how.  I don't understand witches. I just know, you can't be sure their spells don't work.\n\nNormally I get no visits from her at night, unless I practice 4 or more hours.  I think it's just a hit or miss sort of thing, like whale watching.\n\nWhen both parties are awake (not one of them in dreaming awake),  one is  a sorcerer and the other has a double who \"comes around\", then you can also commonly get shared dreaming.\n\nThe second person's dreaming double comes around, as it's like to do from time to time, and the sorcerer's dreaming double, currently not present, notices from whenever it was, and comes to the sorcerer.   Doesn't have to be visible. Neither do.\n\nI've done that  a few times, so I can speak from experience.  Carlos didn't go into details, probably to avoid paranoia and made up experiences in private classes.  People in private classes were like the general population. They cared more about status than actually learning sorcery, so they were like to make up things, to give themselves bonus points.  That sort of behavior is pretty much what's killed the Castaneda community.\n\nWhen La Gorda tried it, Genaro farted so fiercely that the wind blew La Gorda back.  And caused her to feel so ashamed, she got to work for real.\n\nThat sort of waking shared dreaming of the dreaming doubles only,  is \"book keeping only\".  You almost surely are not aware while it is happening.  But later the memories surface as ordinary memories, and you only find out it was not ordinary, if you accidentally ask the other person about it.  \n\nMy guess: That happens more often than the dream/dreaming kind where one party is lucid.\n\nWomen are especially good at it, or else how come they often instantly know when their mate has done them wrong?\n\nBut usually it's more ordinary, and ignored as coincidence.\n\nFor instance, I knew a double woman who's dreaming double was so commonly around her, I had to be careful to consider which one I was seeing. I once got confused, saw her enter a room with no exit, went in to look for her, and found nothing.  Soon after I found her on the other end of the building, too far away to have ran over there unnoticed.\n\nOne time she brought a new notebook with her to show me.  She was proud of it.  When she handed it to me I said, \"Yea, you told me.  Your mother gave it to you, right?.\"\n\nHer reply was, \"No I didn't!  I just got this, and didn't show anyone.\"\n\nI had a clear memory of it, she did not.\n\nThe type of shared dreaming most try to do, where both parties are asleep,  is nearly impossible.\n\nOnly one person will be lucid, so there's very little chance the other will remember it.  More likely is the non-lucid person will readily agree, to get attention and feel important.\n\nWorse, it could be a total success, but that doesn't mean the details will agree. You can be truly sharing a dream with your friend, see them there, and they see you too.\n\nBut for them, you're a pet dog who just turned into a cow, unnoticed by them.  You sort of \"took over\" a character in their dream, the same way we can take over our cyclic beings.  That produced a \"glitch\" in their dream, but normal people don't notice those.\n\nIt's the same way scouts visit our dreams.  They see a good dream interaction going on, and take over the character.\n\nIt's the basis of the 2nd gate of dreaming.\n\nAnd scouts love to imitate friends of yours.  Unless you can see energy (Orange line on that recent J curve diagram), you can't tell it's a scout unless it chases you out of the dream and into your room.  That can easily happen if you are very lucid, and really believe that was your friend, interact a bunch, and they absorb enough energy to follow you out.\n\nImagine you're in a lucid dream, and the character you're with starts trying to hold you down.  You wake up to escape, and he's still there by your bed.\n\nVery frightening...  Unless you know better, and force him to transform into a pleasing shape.  Then, it's \"jackpot!\" time.\n\nThis is a vast topic.  I'm in the dark room right now, waiting for the witching hour.  Didn't have much success doing shared dreaming earlier in the evening.\n\nBut now everyone is asleep, so I'll go back to work.\n\nIt's  hard to intercept dreams when most people are still awake.  It's unfortunate, because it means best practice times are 3AM to 5AM.\n\nI forgot the easiest form of shared dreaming: Phantom copies of your home.  Pandora had one (Carlos compound).  Cholita made one in our home, when she brought a new inorganic being to me to see if it could scare me.  I spend a lot of time in there, occasionally fully awake.\n\nYour account sounds a bit like you made yourself one, but haven't heard of that topic.\n\nAnd there's also the famous \"silence effect\".  People who practice silence a lot, and especially if they do it as they go to sleep, often end up in a \"virtual practice playground\" where practitioners of sorcery go and learn while asleep.\n\nIt's a shared phantom zone.  Taisha writes about it in her new book, as I recall.  But any serious practitioner will encounter this.\n\nI just came out of a phantom zone before I started this reddit reply.  A man was pointing out, I didn't need to lay down and sleep while waiting for 3AM.\n\nI had already been practicing  dreaming awake for hours when I decided I'd better get a little sleep. He reminded me you are asleep when doing darkroom gazing.  HA = sleep walking. So you can skip sleeping entirely if you want.\n\nI had my doubts about that.  Sure, if you were a perfect sorcerer and never left HA the entire night. Or as in the books, if you had a Nagual push your assemblage point there so it was stable for days.\n\nBut we have to do it ourselves, and it's never perfect.  If you skip sleep, you'll suffer a little.", "edited": 1614619069.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gpad3vh", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a far more complicated topic than people realize.

That makes those people  more useful to a sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally the dreaming double of a random person is wandering around in infinity, and finding it is very unlikely. When that&amp;#39;s not the case, you have the reason a sorcerer might take an interest in a specific person.  Carlos did.  It was possible to teach them more easily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you have people around who&amp;#39;s dreaming double comes near to you, because their waking body is near, you can access it if you are a sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at one large workshop where he was explaining this &amp;quot;double right there!&amp;quot;,  there were only 2 of those in the entire workshop.  And neither had a clue who they were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita is like that, which makes sharing dreaming with her easy.  She visited me tonight in her dreaming double, possibly to check up on the results of a spell she has going.  Meaning, her double was curious, so I got a visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita likes food spells, inside containers.  Several times I found an irresistible food item carefully placed on the top of the trash in the bin.  The spell is under that.  Some quite gruesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you open the trash and you say to yourself, &amp;quot;I wonder who threw away this perfectly good delicious unopened packet of Champurrado???&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You reach in, get the Champurrado, and the spell somehow goes into  you.  Don&amp;#39;t ask me how.  I don&amp;#39;t understand witches. I just know, you can&amp;#39;t be sure their spells don&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally I get no visits from her at night, unless I practice 4 or more hours.  I think it&amp;#39;s just a hit or miss sort of thing, like whale watching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When both parties are awake (not one of them in dreaming awake),  one is  a sorcerer and the other has a double who &amp;quot;comes around&amp;quot;, then you can also commonly get shared dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second person&amp;#39;s dreaming double comes around, as it&amp;#39;s like to do from time to time, and the sorcerer&amp;#39;s dreaming double, currently not present, notices from whenever it was, and comes to the sorcerer.   Doesn&amp;#39;t have to be visible. Neither do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done that  a few times, so I can speak from experience.  Carlos didn&amp;#39;t go into details, probably to avoid paranoia and made up experiences in private classes.  People in private classes were like the general population. They cared more about status than actually learning sorcery, so they were like to make up things, to give themselves bonus points.  That sort of behavior is pretty much what&amp;#39;s killed the Castaneda community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When La Gorda tried it, Genaro farted so fiercely that the wind blew La Gorda back.  And caused her to feel so ashamed, she got to work for real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sort of waking shared dreaming of the dreaming doubles only,  is &amp;quot;book keeping only&amp;quot;.  You almost surely are not aware while it is happening.  But later the memories surface as ordinary memories, and you only find out it was not ordinary, if you accidentally ask the other person about it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My guess: That happens more often than the dream/dreaming kind where one party is lucid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women are especially good at it, or else how come they often instantly know when their mate has done them wrong?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But usually it&amp;#39;s more ordinary, and ignored as coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance, I knew a double woman who&amp;#39;s dreaming double was so commonly around her, I had to be careful to consider which one I was seeing. I once got confused, saw her enter a room with no exit, went in to look for her, and found nothing.  Soon after I found her on the other end of the building, too far away to have ran over there unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One time she brought a new notebook with her to show me.  She was proud of it.  When she handed it to me I said, &amp;quot;Yea, you told me.  Your mother gave it to you, right?.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her reply was, &amp;quot;No I didn&amp;#39;t!  I just got this, and didn&amp;#39;t show anyone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a clear memory of it, she did not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The type of shared dreaming most try to do, where both parties are asleep,  is nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only one person will be lucid, so there&amp;#39;s very little chance the other will remember it.  More likely is the non-lucid person will readily agree, to get attention and feel important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse, it could be a total success, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean the details will agree. You can be truly sharing a dream with your friend, see them there, and they see you too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for them, you&amp;#39;re a pet dog who just turned into a cow, unnoticed by them.  You sort of &amp;quot;took over&amp;quot; a character in their dream, the same way we can take over our cyclic beings.  That produced a &amp;quot;glitch&amp;quot; in their dream, but normal people don&amp;#39;t notice those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the same way scouts visit our dreams.  They see a good dream interaction going on, and take over the character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the basis of the 2nd gate of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And scouts love to imitate friends of yours.  Unless you can see energy (Orange line on that recent J curve diagram), you can&amp;#39;t tell it&amp;#39;s a scout unless it chases you out of the dream and into your room.  That can easily happen if you are very lucid, and really believe that was your friend, interact a bunch, and they absorb enough energy to follow you out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;#39;re in a lucid dream, and the character you&amp;#39;re with starts trying to hold you down.  You wake up to escape, and he&amp;#39;s still there by your bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very frightening...  Unless you know better, and force him to transform into a pleasing shape.  Then, it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;jackpot!&amp;quot; time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a vast topic.  I&amp;#39;m in the dark room right now, waiting for the witching hour.  Didn&amp;#39;t have much success doing shared dreaming earlier in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now everyone is asleep, so I&amp;#39;ll go back to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s  hard to intercept dreams when most people are still awake.  It&amp;#39;s unfortunate, because it means best practice times are 3AM to 5AM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forgot the easiest form of shared dreaming: Phantom copies of your home.  Pandora had one (Carlos compound).  Cholita made one in our home, when she brought a new inorganic being to me to see if it could scare me.  I spend a lot of time in there, occasionally fully awake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your account sounds a bit like you made yourself one, but haven&amp;#39;t heard of that topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s also the famous &amp;quot;silence effect&amp;quot;.  People who practice silence a lot, and especially if they do it as they go to sleep, often end up in a &amp;quot;virtual practice playground&amp;quot; where practitioners of sorcery go and learn while asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a shared phantom zone.  Taisha writes about it in her new book, as I recall.  But any serious practitioner will encounter this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just came out of a phantom zone before I started this reddit reply.  A man was pointing out, I didn&amp;#39;t need to lay down and sleep while waiting for 3AM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had already been practicing  dreaming awake for hours when I decided I&amp;#39;d better get a little sleep. He reminded me you are asleep when doing darkroom gazing.  HA = sleep walking. So you can skip sleeping entirely if you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had my doubts about that.  Sure, if you were a perfect sorcerer and never left HA the entire night. Or as in the books, if you had a Nagual push your assemblage point there so it was stable for days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we have to do it ourselves, and it&amp;#39;s never perfect.  If you skip sleep, you&amp;#39;ll suffer a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false,

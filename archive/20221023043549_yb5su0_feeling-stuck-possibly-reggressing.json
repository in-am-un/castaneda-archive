You won't believe what that can do.\n\nThe second attention position is associated with the double.\n\nTry 1/2 inch below your belly button, to 1 inch above it as the level from the floor.  Move your fingers straight out along that plane, then 4 inches to the right. Wiggle there.  18-24 inches from your stomach and 4 inches to the right.\n\nThe most obvious thing will be vague white sparkles or flashes. If you see those, and even if they're quickly boring, keep doing it a while to get your eyes \"used to the darkness\".\n\nYou're denting the luminous shell of the energy body. The double's is a lot more \"fluffy\" than our luminous shell version.\n\nKeep in mind, not every weirdness you see in darkroom is \"the same thing\".\n\nIt's easy to lump it all together like that, but there's very distinct things.\n\nI suppose it's like you are sitting in a park in super heavy fog, and can't see a thing from your bench.\n\nBut you get lucky, and the guy with the Churro cart walks by. He gets close enough for you to see the glow of the heat lamp he has shining on the already finished churros in a metal bin.\n\nKeep in mind, the metal bin also has a spot of glow you might notice, if you gaze longer  at what you can make out of his heat lamp. There's also a little reflection of it,  down below on the left.  A tiny dot.\n\nBut all you see is a single puff of reddish light.\n\nElsewhere a little kid coated a helium balloon with fluorescent green paint, so he could watch it hover in the fog like a UFO.  Maybe even scare the weird lady sitting on the bench, staring off into the fog.\n\nIt gets away from him and slowly drifts by you.\n\nYou see it and think, \"This is paying off!  The reddish puff got bigger, and now it's turning bright green!\"\n\nYou get a few goosebumps.\n\nActually, they aren't the same thing at all.\n\nIn darkroom there are pieces of your energy body. Those are sentient.\n\nThere are faces that materialize on the puffs.  Those are only \"using the very faintest puffs\" to make themselves visible.  But are in fact inorganic beings.\n\nThen there's what the \"tonal\" eyes can see. Those have some limited ability to \"see energy\" all by themselves.\n\nBut the double's eyes can see anything they like.\n\nSo dream scenes will appear in the darkness.  Often on top of a diffuse puff.  You see literally dream bubbles in the air!  Later you can learn to zip right into those, fully real, fully awake, eyes open.\n\nTechnically, you \"borrowed the double's eyes\" to see those at first.\n\nWhen you're using the doubles eyes to perceive things, it's \"non-directional\".\n\nDoesn't behave like a \"real\" thing.\n\nSo it \"follows\" the turn of your head, and you conclude it's just a hallucination.\n\nOr it does something else, which doesn't fit  with our expectations of using binocular vision from the eyes.\n\nEven when it begins to obey our expectations, there aren't 2 separate views of it, from each eye, so no way to \"triangulate\" distance.\n\nThere's a lot of crazy stuff in that foggy park at night, and it's important to remember that it's not all the same thing.\n\nSo you can figure out what brings the Churro cart around, and what's essentially random, like the kid with the glowing balloon.\n\nWhen you get good at that, you can wave your hands in the right way, and cause the puffs you stuffed on your pouches, to release and \"swarm\" for you.\n\nYou can send them up to the south east corner of the room, to form a \"whorl\" and try to read text from it.\n\nBut you can also do a tensegrity movement you have trained to produce a result, and when you reach out your hand at the end, a \"magical object\" can form high up, and drift down into your hand.\n\nYou can use those to do ANYTHING.  I don't believe there's a limit on what those can do.\n\nThere's also \"the high and the low\".\n\nA completely different topic filled with fun stuff.\n\nThe low can materialize cobwebs, which is the glow of your own tonal awareness, dropped onto the floor as you walk around.\n\nBut because it's the tonal's awareness, if you gaze into it, it can form scenes for you.  Such as you are suddenly walking on cracked mud.  With absolutely perfect details.  You'd even get a shiver up your spine out of excitement and fear, if you weren't deep in the red zone and no longer cared about such things.\n\nIf you \"make a mood\" while walking on the real looking phantom floor, the mood spreads up the walls of the room, and you find yourself in another world.  The mood could be something as simple as, an impression of the last place where you saw cracked mud like that. The place could materialize all around you because you \"expect it\".\n\nVividness depending on how much \"energy\" you have.  Dreaming energy.\n\nSunlight glitter helps with that.\n\nBut \"the high\" is just as cool!\n\nYou can literally stretch your luminous shell upward.  Just by gazing up there.\n\nSo if you turn your head to look up at the zenith, and in so doing curve your back a bit in a way you aren't accustomed to, you can summon \"yellow sparkles\" above you.\n\nSummon them!  At will when you get advanced enough.\n\nThose are some sort of \"Silent Knowledge Preview\".\n\nNot actual  silent knowledge which obeys your choice of topic, and lets knowledge flow with that in mind, but that yellow \"high energy sparkle\" is a \"window\" to silent knowledge.\n\nTechnically, I suspect it's the \"shiny outer coating\" as a patch.\n\nPossibly the tonal's ability to *see*.  It's not just the awareness of our double, which refused to be in the flesh body, that can do amazing things.\n\nBut the tonal awareness perhaps needs to be \"real\" to do stuff.\n\nSo the shiny sparkles from above are \"real\" enough, and you can spread them out to \"do things\".\n\nThey can form La Gorda's \"eye\".\n\nBut you kind of need the guy with the Churro cart to come around a few times first.  Start small and build from there as the assemblage point moves.\n\nOf course, women can simply \"notice something\" and zip right over there.\n\nThe trick seems to be, how to get them to actually look around.", "edited": 1666620214.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_itl5sgb", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, that&amp;#39;s a more advanced technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But works spectacularly later on!

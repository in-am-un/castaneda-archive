And we didn't get to eat the Mexican food for a couple of days.\n\nSo I suppose we're doomed not to see that \"wall of fog\".\n\nBesides, we start out in normal consciousness and then weird stuff materializes all around us.\n\nSo we're already \"inside\" whatever we perceive.

It's bound to be \"dusty\" down there.\n\nThus, \"crystalline dreaming fog\" shows up for intermediate dark room people.\n\nIt's just a description.\n\nNot a \"thing in itself\" which is \"inevitable\" on the path of sorcery.\n\nSome of what we're doing will be \"off path\" from the books.\n\nBut not most of it.\n\nAnd, we have instructions from Carlos in his last publications.  To make sure we know we're going the right way.\n\nWe're sticking closely to those.\n\nThere's no mention in his instructions of having to battle the \"wall of fog\" the way he did.\n\nI suspect we stop the rotation of the wall of fog when we cause the puffs to become fully directional.\n\nNamely: when we switch to 80% or more \"double\".  Same as to stop the wall of fog from rotating, I suspect.\n\nBy the way, this is one way you can tell a fraud.\n\nThere's no faker out there who will get this stuff right!\n\nThey'll copy, and even insist things go as they are in the books.\n\nAnd give themselves away.\n\nSo I'd say, you've just proven you aren't a faker!  You didn't copy.\n\nIn fact, what you found makes no sense, compared to what others found so far.\n\nSo it's genuine.\n\nLater you can tell us what became of it, and eventually we'll have so many pass through here we might even have a flow chart on what can happen next based on what happened last.\n\nWe could prank new people.\n\nAsk them, what exactly did you see???\n\nThen tell them we're looking it up.\n\nAnd respond:  \"Man, this is going to be rough.   Trolls again... I hope you're ready for what comes next!\"\n\nAs for, can it possibly be nothing at all, and you're making a big deal out of nothing?\n\nThere is one \"risky\" area.\n\nBetween blue and green.\n\nWhere \"daydreaming\" automatically dominates.\n\nThe green zone is sort of like a condom to the red zone.\n\nTo protect us from being infected by the red, while trying to live in the blue.\n\nSo green zone stuff  always \"feels\" a little fake.\n\nThe same way a daydream is not at all the same as really seeing something.\n\nSo even down to the green line you can \"see\" a puff in the air and doubt yourself.\n\nWe don't have good rules for how someone could decide if they \"really\" saw it, or imagined it.\n\nIn fact, it's actually quite difficult to do that.\n\nNo problem.  You'll be down in the red zone soon.\n\nThen the stuff above it isn't that important.\n\n(Though, it probably should be analyzed more).", "edited": 1635379010.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hibdcvg", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suppose we don&amp;#39;t really know what that stuff is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if it looks to you like a &amp;quot;fog&amp;quot;, and it &amp;quot;isn&amp;#39;t really there&amp;quot;, then it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;second attention fog&amp;quot;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it was made out of chocolate, it would be a chocolate fog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s made out of something you visibly see, which cannot exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not your &amp;quot;primary attention&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s got to be &amp;quot;second attention&amp;quot; stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The witches used to call something they perceived a &amp;quot;fog&amp;quot;, and I believe they actually said &amp;quot;Fog of the Second Attention&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#39;d have to search Techno&amp;#39;s cool new &amp;quot;all information on Castaneda in one place&amp;quot; to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is, everyone was expecting &amp;quot;the wall of fog&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s something Emilito brings you to, after the Nagual strikes your back, and you sit around eating Mexican food outside Mexico city for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyeing hot Josefina, and wondering how hard she hits when she&amp;#39;s angry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita hits hard by the way...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, no Nagual&amp;#39;s struck our back.

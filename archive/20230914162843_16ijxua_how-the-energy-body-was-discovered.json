But there's no saying, until you learn to \"see\" that yourself, what shape it might be taking in order to produce the sight of the double.\n\nHard maybe for a beginner to understand, but consider that to seers the human body looks nothing like what it looks in your normal view of reality.\n\nIt's also just energy fields, which project the impression of what we have come to know as our \"flesh body\".\n\nIf you need proof of that, just consider what a good 5 grams dried of shrooms will do to your perception of your flesh body.\n\nIn fact, it's obviously \"up for grabs\" what you perceive. We've just made a bunch of rules so that we can ignore variations. Such as, \"You might see anything at all on shrooms.  It's not real.\"\n\nSo we feel free to ignore it.\n\nThen in a dream, you might look down and see that you're a donkey.\n\nBut we ignore that obvious variation too, saying, \"It's just a dream!  Everyone knows those don't have to make any sense.\"\n\nAnd most of the time, up at the blue line on that J curve map, your body always looks relatively consistent.\n\nBut it's not.\n\nWhat you see is formed from something else that we don't pay attention to anymore.\n\nAnd that \"Tonal Body\" has a container holding it in place.\n\nThe \"luminous egg\" into which our awareness was placed, to create us.\n\nSo our Tonal body is perhaps a bit more consistent than the situation with our dreaming body, which not only is just a projection of those puffs of awareness of our energy body, but which has no reason to make a tight, well formed ball of itself.\n\nThe tonal awareness is trapped in your internal organs.  Which are in the center of that Luminous egg, when perceived as a real thing.\n\nThe double, and the awareness from which it comes, has no such limitations on its location in space.\n\nIt might even be in the shape of 3 pieces in a dream.\n\nOne forming the \"you\" in the dream, one forming someone else in the dream so you can switch back and forth in perspective, and some roaming around up to no good, doing other things.\n\nIf you learn to play with those purple puffs, you'll come to the same conclusion I have.\n\nYour \"energy body\" is both sentient, and dividable.\n\nMy estimate is that you can make 8 sentient \"things\" from your energy body.\n\nEach less sentient, the less of the total 8 is used.\n\nIt's not such a radical conclusion, when you consider that we can send some of our Tonal Awareness along with our double inside a dream, to make it more rational.\n\nThat's how you manage to find your hands, inside a dream.  Even the tonal awareness can divide into sentient pieces.\n\nAnd that this tonal awareness going along with your double inside a dream, tends to wear off and return to your physical body.  \n\nIn 10 seconds or less for a beginner.\n\nBut 4 of those dreaming body forming \"puffs\" is likely enough for a fairly reliable Zombie assistant.  \n\nDon't have to use all 8.\n\nYou can even manufacture a Zombie who will stick around in your darkroom for a full day, from a single puff manipulated with \"Pandora's Box\" magical pass.\n\nThat's what it does! Form pieces of your energy body, into \"things\".\n\nSo even if your \"double\" is pretty well formed, and even if you somehow bring your double from the phantom realms of dreaming and into the real world (as Cholita has done), the \"energy body\" shape it has when seen as pure awareness is not necessarily very well formed.\n\nNot the tight \"blue ball of energy\" which don Juan said the new seers prefer.\n\nAnd in fact, in those words from the books of Carlos, we have a clue about this.\n\nIf it's \"preferred\" that means there's other possibilities.\n\nSo how did the round ball of blue glowing light, which you can read about in the books in regards to don Genaro showing off for Carlos,  come to be?\n\nIf you practice darkroom daily until it's common to be surrounded by intense magical sights, you notice that the purple puffs begin to take an interest.\n\nYou don't have to look for them anymore. They just kind of show up if things get interesting.\n\nThey tend to concentrate around the center of action while you are doing tensegrity, which would mostly be your arms.\n\nSo instead of seeing a stray puff floating by, which you might scoop up and apply to the right side of your stomach, you see at least 4 of them circling slowly around your torso.\n\nThe tensegrity moves manipulate that sight, even though beginners can't see it visually yet, to teach you that you can \"form\" those into a more solid group.\n\nBut scooping them up with your hand and applying them to the 3 \"pouches\" on your torso, is also another strategy.\n\nYou place them on the places in the physical body with the highest concentration of Tonal awareness.\n\nSo that they'll \"suck up\" a little rationality while they're sitting on those locations.\n\nThey do leave of course.  Won't stay there forever.\n\nThey're a lot like puppies.  You can convince a puppy to sit still on a certain spot, if it's rewarding, but they won't stay there long.\n\nEven so, the most basic strategy in Tensegrity is \"scoop and stuff\".\n\nPossibly because you are introducing rationality to the purple puffs, which it picks up when it's so close to the tonal awareness in the pouches.\n\nThe next major strategy in Tensegrity, which makes the point I'm trying to convey here, is to \"form\" the energy body.\n\nAffection for the energy body Tensegrity pass is a perfect example of this.\n\nYou gather all the purple puffs floating around your torso using your arms, and \"inject\" some tendon energy and arm rotational activity,  by shaping and then piercing it with your knife hands.\n\nTo get it to form the double.\n\nYou even shape a head, arms, torso, legs, knees, and feet for it!\n\nKeep in mind, Tensegrity is based on the observations of seers.\n\nWho then took what they \"saw\" and used it for practical magic.\n\nAs you progress in sorcery, you'll learn to move your assemblage point far enough to be surrounded by puffs swarming your torso.\n\nAnd then it might become obvious how the new seers came up with the \"blue ball of energy\".\n\nThey convinced that swarm to form a single bigger puff.\n\nInstead of dividing into pieces.\n\nAnd then by \"treating it as real\" with finger wiggling on the second attention assemblage point, they got your energy body to \"like\" that shape.\n\nEventually you can use it to break the laws of physics.\n\nAnd so, how did the new seers come to create the \"energy body\" that we know of?\n\nThey just saw it forming around them by itself, and learned they could get it to take a very \"solid\" shape.\n\nWhich was useful in the daily world.\n\nThey didn't \"invent\" it.\n\nThey noticed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How The Energy Body Was

You can indeed visit God!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But he&amp;#39;s a paper cutout created by everyone who pleads to him for help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s what he does. He sits or stands before you, and asks, &amp;quot;What did you want to ask?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only seen him once, but I took off running for the bathtub.  I didn&amp;#39;t understand enough at the time, to just ask him for something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gold coins maybe?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;ll likely agree, but you&amp;#39;ll never see them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &amp;quot;Enochian magic&amp;quot; is most likely a total scam. Invented in the middle ages by Jewish Scholars,  and then exploited in Europe by &amp;quot;exotic franchise&amp;quot; seeker type bad players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evil men like we have to battle with in here, constantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much like the ones who first inflicted Buddhism on the USA. I saw a picture of those losers once.  All decked out in Buddhist robes, smiling.  University professors I believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kabbalah is not likely to be something originally actually practiced by the Prophets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too bad, I liked the idea of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They did have some form of magic, and there was even a college for prophets in a cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Led by Hulda, a woman, mentioned in Kings 22:14-20 and 2 Chronicles 34:22-28.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to forget, there was the witch of Endor (a Cholita style witch), and the Egyptian sorcerers who could summon snakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the jewish scribes scrubbed all descriptions of Jewish magic from the final biblical texts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And whatever they could do, they were obviously too lame to repeat it often enough to understand what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typical &amp;quot;successful&amp;quot; bad players.   Like Ingram or Shinzen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who get a couple of green zone experiences, and then declare themselves to be Saints.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_16ijxua", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/16ijxua/how_the_energy_body_was_discovered/k0onhfz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1694778471.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "k0nrwbb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "upir117", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1694755985.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_16ijxua", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6bf8p565", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Dan, thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy days and sharing all your knowledge with us and creating images and videos to give us an idea of what should be happening!

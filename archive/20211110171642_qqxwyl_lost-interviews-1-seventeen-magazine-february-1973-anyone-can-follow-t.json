A man who used drugs to pretend to be doing sorcery, lied to us so often there ended up being no point in talking to him at all, and had to be tossed out for an obsession with convincing others of his fake power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;re just a plant by the equivalent of the native american KKK?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Attacking anyone who dares to ride in the front of your bus?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t you go somewhere else?  There&amp;#39;s many Castaneda discussion groups out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they love pretend sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_qqxwyl", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qqxwyl/lost_interviews_1_seventeen_magazine_february/hk7msj7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1636644561.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1636644561.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hk70n1a", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hk6zu7o", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "downs": 0, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qqxwyl/lost_interviews_1_seventeen_magazine_february/hk70n1a/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_hk70n1a", "created": 1636633591.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1636633591.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hk6zu7o", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hk6vyqj", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "What's the benefit of being a troll?\n\nTheres not a single person in here who believes you have any sorcery understanding. \n\nDidn't you look around?

And what was going on in the background, in secret.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given a chance, he and his friends will destroy this place to make themselves feel better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t you notice that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see you hovering around native american related subreddits to comment, like the peyote subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the zen one too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And dzogchen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you realize, those will get you nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take an actual look around on the web!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they could, there would be a place like this where people are learning to do what the dzogchen people only talk about doing, some day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, we get youtube videos about the amazing yogis of Tibet, which wouldn&amp;#39;t even qualify as an intermediate practitioner in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the Zen guys will tell you that magic doesn&amp;#39;t exist, right to your face!  In anger too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Very angry those Zen guys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until you remind them of the buddha, and then they get embarrassed and correct the statement.  Change it to &amp;quot;magic bad&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But almost never do they learn anything real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s Shinzen and Ingram, but more people with actual knowledge, no one has brought to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enlightenment is in fact trivial, and more like what the Hindus describe, than what Asia turned it into, to fit into their oppressive sonority based social order.  Where enlightenment has to be a permanent thing, or it would shame the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you try to get either of those places, Zen or Dzogchen, interested in actually learning, you get lynched or banned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;m hoping to make you serious about trying what&amp;#39;s in here, not criticize you.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Buddhists, if we gain enough sincere practitioners we can travel in groups to other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of sitting around chanting, we can be exploring infinity, for real!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or show actual magic to new people.  My idea is remote viewing on the ground, which can be seen by new people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe even convince Cholita to demonstrate magic!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She breaks the laws of physics when she wants to please me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(which is almost never).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_qqxwyl", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qqxwyl/lost_interviews_1_seventeen_magazine_february/hkc9ts4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1636730196.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1636730196.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 3, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hkaaqkz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "mattiesab", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hk6vmyj", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_17ejp3bp", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I wonder if you have the humility to accept that some of the comparisons you made in this comment are incorrect or incomplete?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hkaaqkz", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if you have the humility to accept that some of the comparisons you made in this comment are incorrect or incomplete?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_qqxwyl", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/qqxwyl/lost_interviews_1_seventeen_magazine_february/hkaaqkz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1636685749.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1636685749.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hk6vmyj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1636630099.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hk4xep2", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "So charly is a plant from stoopidengine?\n\nOr we actually got the interest of some by me visiting the shamanism subreddit?\n\nFirst, this is siberian shamanism.

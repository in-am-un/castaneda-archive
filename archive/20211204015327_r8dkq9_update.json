It only gets more vivid with more silence.\n\nYes it's crucial to force silence, and make it of #1 importance in  your practicing.\n\nBut I wouldn't worry about becoming too involved with the visions,  unless you're actually dozing off, closing your eyes so you go inside,  and dreaming.   Or  using drugs as an aid.\n\nBoth are a dead end for trying to move along the J curve.\n\nAnd then there's horizontal shifting, but that causes shapeshifting at all levels, so you'd notice that.  At the blue line, it causes those \"feverish visions\" that never stop. That's also shape shifting, but it's at a mental level.\n\nEasier perhaps to think of this \"horizontal shift hazard\" as, if you get stuck in a weird vision and lose your rationality that was shape shifting.  For instance, you wake up in the middle of the night, want to practice, but are too lazy to get up.  So you just gaze at the darkness.  And find yourself \"smoothing off\" grey patches, as if that were your practice.  You smooth one off, move it along, and another rolls in for your to smooth off. They become patches of carpet.\n\nYou sort of ignore the designer label in the upper right corner of each one, and are proud of yourself for having smoothed off 6 so far.  You have some weird goal in mind, but you aren't thinking clearly anymore.\n\nThat's caused b y shape shifting, even at the blue zone.  More likely green though.\n\nHorizontal shifting.\n\nIt's important to notice it, becuase it'll be completely gone when you get back to normal.\n\n\\&gt;Also I still haven\u2019t been able to hit red zone yet\n\nIt's possible that what you are doing will bypass the red zone, mostly.\n\nOur goal is to get to the orange zone and see the whitish light, then use that to play with *intent*.\n\nIf you bypass the red zone, you don't get as much help from your double.\n\nBut at the far orange zone, the double pretty much takes over because everything you try to do is impossible.\n\nSo you're in  uncharted territory.  I'd say, don't worry if you skip over the red zone.  In your case, of using gazing. Everyone else needs to make sure they pass through that red zone, clearly.  Or you won't have much \"power\" in the early orange zone.\n\nIf you try to skip it, remember that unless you see the world turned into whitish light with heavy line texture, and all knowledge is available to you (poorly), you didn't get to the orange zone.\n\nJust a warning not to visualize it, because you're clearly in the green zone, and you might create a substitute whitish light.\n\nAlso, don't forget about sky gazing,  and asphalt gazing as you walk.\n\nTaisha says to look for \"worms\" in the sky, but I suspect she meant \"eye dust\".\n\nOnce you have the whitish light, you can do with the sky, what is on the cover of \"Wheel of Time\".\n\nIncredible magic, Merlin the magician would envy!\n\nIt also starts with \"colors\" as explained by Carlos in one of the later publications.\n\nBut Taisha started with tiny details. The worms.\n\nCholita likes cloud gazing, but she sees the darker side of inorganic beings up there.\n\nSkulls on or in the clouds.\n\nAnd also on any \"flat surface\" like our dirt back yard.\n\nAsphalt gazing is done while walking, using the monotonous nature of asphalt.  The \"stuff\" forms above that, on eye junk that is moving along over the asphalt.  Little space ships, hot air balloons, weird insects.\n\nAnd don't forget about the \"alternative swamp\".\n\nWe live up at the blue line in the river of filth.\n\nBut once you can move your assemblage point, there are 2 other swampy places you can get stuck.\n\nThe red zone.  Which don Juan called a \"quagmire\".\n\nYes...  But what a fun quagmire!\n\nIt's possible you'll bypass that one, but if you do keep in mind, your \"energy body\" still needs rebuilding in some manner.\n\nThen there's the \"seeing quagmire\".\n\nIt really is!  Answers, new techniques and new possible paths present themselves to you each night.\n\nFrom reading between the lines, I'd guess that the old seers tried to pursue as many of those as they could, even keeping them secret from each other, like they were prizes.\n\nBut we don't want to do that.  Better is to let \"the spirit\" gift you with a new thing.\n\nAnd accept that if it is going to gift you \"all the way\", it has to change the gift every 2 days.\n\nPretend it's a lesson from don Juan.  The next day you don't insist on the same lesson, and reject any new ones.\n\nHere's an example.  Star Gazing.\n\nYou can learn to gaze at the ceiling in darkness, see through it, and pick up the stars and constellations.\n\nThey show up as a dazzling light show of flickers, sparks, dots, and twinkles.\n\nWith energy lines between them!\n\nYou could pursue that for  years, getting better and better.\n\nBut there's 10000 more things like that possible.\n\nAnd we're trying to get even past that, to the purple zone, where you pretty much don't care anymore.  Because there are abstract concerns that override practical magic.", "edited": 1638636203.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_hn7jioe", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;it\u2019s very easy to get caught up trying to use what silence produces to move the assemblage point rather than using silence itself&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re gazing at something that&amp;#39;s pure second attention, it&amp;#39;s a huge tool for silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You play with how vivid it gets.

More likely green though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Horizontal shifting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to notice it, becuase it&amp;#39;ll be completely gone when you get back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Also I still haven\u2019t been able to hit red zone yet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that what you are doing will bypass the red zone, mostly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to get to the orange zone and see the whitish light, then use that to play with &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you bypass the red zone, you don&amp;#39;t get as much help from your double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the far orange zone, the double pretty much takes over because everything you try to do is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;#39;re in  uncharted territory.  I&amp;#39;d say, don&amp;#39;t worry if you skip over the red zone.  In your case, of using gazing. Everyone else needs to make sure they pass through that red zone, clearly.  Or you won&amp;#39;t have much &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; in the early orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you try to skip it, remember that unless you see the world turned into whitish light with heavy line texture, and all knowledge is available to you (poorly), you didn&amp;#39;t get to the orange zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a warning not to visualize it, because you&amp;#39;re clearly in the green zone, and you might create a substitute whitish light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, don&amp;#39;t forget about sky gazing,  and asphalt gazing as you walk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taisha says to look for &amp;quot;worms&amp;quot; in the sky, but I suspect she meant &amp;quot;eye dust&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have the whitish light, you can do with the sky, what is on the cover of &amp;quot;Wheel of Time&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Incredible magic, Merlin the magician would envy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also starts with &amp;quot;colors&amp;quot; as explained by Carlos in one of the later publications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Taisha started with tiny details. The worms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita likes cloud gazing, but she sees the darker side of inorganic beings up there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skulls on or in the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And also on any &amp;quot;flat surface&amp;quot; like our dirt back yard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asphalt gazing is done while walking, using the monotonous nature of asphalt.  The &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; forms above that, on eye junk that is moving along over the asphalt.  Little space ships, hot air balloons, weird insects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;#39;t forget about the &amp;quot;alternative swamp&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We live up at the blue line in the river of filth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once you can move your assemblage point, there are 2 other swampy places you can get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The red zone.  Which don Juan called a &amp;quot;quagmire&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes...  But what a fun quagmire!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible you&amp;#39;ll bypass that one, but if you do keep in mind, your &amp;quot;energy body&amp;quot; still needs rebuilding in some manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;seeing quagmire&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really is!  Answers, new techniques and new possible paths present themselves to you each night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From reading between the lines, I&amp;#39;d guess that the old seers tried to pursue as many of those as they could, even keeping them secret from each other, like they were prizes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we don&amp;#39;t want to do that.  Better is to let &amp;quot;the spirit&amp;quot; gift you with a new thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And accept that if it is going to gift you &amp;quot;all the way&amp;quot;, it has to change the gift every 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretend it&amp;#39;s a lesson from don Juan.  The next day you don&amp;#39;t insist on the same lesson, and reject any new ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an example.  Star Gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can learn to gaze at the ceiling in darkness, see through it, and pick up the stars and constellations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They show up as a dazzling light show of flickers, sparks, dots, and twinkles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With energy lines between them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could pursue that for  years, getting better and better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s 10000 more things like that possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#39;re trying to get even past that, to the purple zone, where you pretty much don&amp;#39;t care anymore.  Because there are abstract concerns that override practical magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/r8dkq9/update/hn7jioe/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1638635223.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_r8dkq9", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_r8dkq9", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hn8e0xv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_r8dkq9", "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "[deleted]", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[deleted]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/r8dkq9/update/hn8e0xv/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_hn8e0xv", "created": 1638647823.0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1638647823.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}], "before": null}}]

Which is something you have to learn.  The feeling of a \"gaze\", which is really a \"shine\".\n\nA good way to feel this, if you aren't very good at gazing yet, is to use the cellphone energy technique.  That's where you let the sun reflect off the cellphone screen, while the phone is off, and you squint your eyes until your eye lashes create sparkles and lines of light from the sun.\n\nThe cellphone screen dims the sun enough that it won't hurt your eyes, and the glitter stores up dreaming energy.\n\nYes, it really works!  Astoundingly in fact.\n\nBut it also teaches the \"tickle\" of a gaze, while you're looking at sparks of light.\n\nThat's the gaze you can use to make light spin when practicing silence with the eyes closed.\n\nThe first time I summoned Carlos' allies, I was using this technique.\n\nIt was shortly after Carlos introduced us to them in class.\n\nI tried to make a yellowish light stronger with a sideways fanning movement, using my gaze.  Eyes still closed.\n\nIt got really bright, so I tried to make it rotate.\n\nIt started to rotate, and I stopped my gaze to watch the effects.\n\nIt opened up into a tunnel of whitish light, with two very strange men inside.\n\nOne was frantically trying to tell me something.  I got the impression it was related to how to find and use that tunnel.\n\nThe other was crouched down, hiding behind the first one's legs.  He only peeked out from the side of his knee.\n\nI can't recall if he was frantically speaking, but he was definitely not very friendly looking.\n\nThe bold one was \"Little Smoke\".  I learned that over time.\n\nI haven't enough experience calling them to say this for sure, but Little Smoke seems to prefer waking dreaming interactions with people.\n\nThe Devil's Weed ally, for which we don't know the name, seems to prefer sleeping dreaming interactions.\n\nIt's about the level of energy generated by our emotions.\n\nSometimes it's just too much for them.\n\nIf you visit the inorganic beings realm, you have to be careful the first time, not to be so frightened that you generate a huge burst of fear energy.\n\nThey'll flee.\n\nCarlos wrote about it.\n\nI also saw it myself, the first time.\n\nMy entity, \"Fairy\" brought me in.  I trained an inorganic being not to be so frightening, so I could use her to help others.\n\nThe inorganic beings realm materialized on my bedroom wall, while I was using the \"Readers of Infinity\" technique Carlos wrote about.\n\nThe fastest way to learn that technique, that I know of, is by gazing at darkness.\n\nAfter 2 hours of gazing in silence, other worlds start to materialize on your bedroom walls.\n\nNormally I can't go into them. If you walk towards them they recede away, until you bump into the bedroom wall and find yourself no closer to the scene.  It's a little like trying to get the \"wall of fog\" to stop rotating.\n\nBoth are about the percentage of second attention you are using, versus the percentage of first attention.  With too much first attention, the wall rotates.  I like to call that, \"non-directionality\", meaning, it's not located at a real location, so it moves with your head.\n\nThat day Fairy flew in, and the color of both Fairy and that world changed to a pinker and redder tone. Worlds assembled on bedroom walls tend to be less colorful than the actual thing, once you enter it.\n\nI stuck my head through the bedroom wall, and into that world just a foot or two.  Of course, I didn't realize that. It was just possible to look in there, even though it was past the physical wall.\n\nThe frightening sight made my heart skip a few beats.\n\nIt was a cliff made from conglomerate rock, with grooves up and down the length, which stretched far above the ceiling in my bedroom.\n\nHoles in the cliff contained horribly distorted people, in a huge variety of clothing styles, both sexes, and even different \"occupations\".  Some were even ghoulish.\n\nThey were stretching out of the holes, like a worm popping his head out to take a look.\n\nFairy was calmly flying above me, but my sudden fright shock caused all of the weird people to zip away. I could almost feel them flee as if my fright were a shock wave, and they didn't start to move until it actually hit them. It was an explosion of fleeing inorganic beings.  I didn't notice enough to tell if they fled away, or back into their holes.  It was just too frightening to think straight.\n\nAll but one fled.\n\nI ended up with Fairy on one hand, and an entity I pulled from the wall in the other.  I wanted to experiment and see if two could sit next to each other, on the same hand.\n\nThe size of inorganic beings is optional, since they don't actually have an organic body.\n\nI didn't realize it at the time, but the act of training fairy to be less frightening, so I could introduce her to others to help them, seems to have convinced her that we're on a mission to help others learn to move their assemblage points.\n\nIt could be, the little smoke was always on that mission, even back when don Juan had control over her.\n\nOr it could also be that inorganic beings like our energy, whether it's from fright, or from learning to move the assemblage point somewhere new.\n\nSo they'll help the old sorcerers frighten random people to death.\n\nBut they would also have helped them teach apprentices.\n\nIn both cases, they get energy.", "edited": 1594568899.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fxu4bmx", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to roll my eyes when I was practicing silence in a chair and saw light with my eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can &amp;quot;fan&amp;quot; it side to side, and brighten it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you can move your eyes in circles, to make it spin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t actually rotate them around and around, once you understand this gazing technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just your gaze that moves.

Last I remembered, people don't know quite why [EMDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing#Mechanism) works but the hypothesis is that the side-to-side eye-movements promote [amygdala deactivation](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/40/8694) and is a specific manifestation of [bilateral stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_stimulation). Interestingly, another take is that EMDR helps induce brain wave patterns similar to those found in a non-REM slow-wave sleeping state, where the limbic system is down-regulated so that memory processing can take place without over-arousing the emotional system, which is prone to re-experiencing past memories/trauma, allowing for memory consolidation with clear past/present differentiation. \n\n\nControl over the self, in this way, would \nbe useful if one wanted to maintain lucidity during REM states.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fy2p1is", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interesting observation.

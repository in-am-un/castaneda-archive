She rolled her eyes too, as if she were surprised it went in that far.\n\nCholita tends to continue conversations which had no beginning,  so when she asked, \"What else?\", I had to think fast.\n\nI said, \"You mean on reddit?\"\n\nShe said, \"Sure!  How are your little friends.  Still making money off me?\"\n\nI began to explain that I was not on reddit as part of a vast government conspiracy to enslave her and make millions from her likeness.\n\nOr to sex traffic her.\n\nI was there to help Castaneda followers wake up, and practice for real.\n\nAnd one part of that was a desire to find \"proof\", in order to convince them it's worth practicing.\n\nShe picked up the second egg roll, having finished the first.  The plate was now empty.\n\nI explained that lately I'd been playing with Fairy in her world, and I'd seen at least 6 instances of objects moving around in my house, just immediately after I'd been looking at them.\n\nCholita had finished the second egg roll, and the empty dim sum plate was right below her chin. She was leaning into the table  a little.\n\nI explained that it might be possible to learn to move objects just by looking at them, the way Nyei had been explaining in an interview.\n\nI'd long forgotten about that, Carlos having banned me from reading his books any more.\n\nI said as I recalled, the procedure was just to look at the object.\n\nCholita glanced down at the dim sum plate, without moving her head. Only her eyes looked down at it.\n\nA ball of white light the size of a golf ball flew under the plate.\n\nIt bumped up at least 1 inch, soup splashing a little around it.\n\nI thought for an instant that I could see all the spilled soup collecting into a taller puddle, right under the plate. As if something was sucking the water up.  It was a very circular puddle, the size of the plate, with strong ripples in it, all perfectly round.\n\nIt was impossible at that scale.\n\nThe plate hadn't bumped up!\n\nThe soup had pushed it up.\n\nI remembered Carlos point out the water cooler in Dance Home, when it made a noise to emphasize a point in his lecture.\n\nHe introduced his allies to us, also using that water cooler. He said they like water.\n\nI felt dizzy, and a little confused, after seeing the puff of light fly under the plate.\n\nI'd clearly seen it.  And the plate had moved almost violently.\n\nBut you just can't believe a thing like that.\n\nI started to ignore it.  Mr. DoubleTake was burying the memory.\n\nBut I resisted.  I'd seen weirder things than that before.\n\nTrying to keep it in clear memory I forced myself to say, \"Yea!  Just like that Cholita!  Did you see the plate jump???\"\n\nOnce I'd spoken about it openly, my mind started to clear up. A fog was lifting.\n\nYes, the plate had moved!  I saw it with my own eyes.\n\nI wondered why I was about to ignore that?\n\nCholita was looking into my eyes with a little anger now.\n\nShe glanced down at the plate again, in the same odd way.  Her head didn't quite bend as much as would be normal, and her gaze was fierce.\n\nThe plate slid 1 inch to the right.  It was such a surprise, I still couldn't believe it.\n\nI looked around the side a little to make sure Cholita wasn't doing some trick.\n\nI didn't see anything unusual. Besides, the plate had moved too slowly.\n\nOr maybe too smoothly.\n\nIt looked mechanical, not like a human had done it with some tool or a stick.\n\nAnd Cholita couldn't even deposit a check at the bank.\n\nWe'd tried 3 times in the last month.\n\nShe's too far gone to plan a trick like moving that dim sum plate through artificial means.\n\nI was so excited, I can't recall exactly what I said.\n\nBut it was along the lines of, \"You MUST have seen it that time!!!!\"\n\nCholita seemed to have taken offense at me ordering her around like that.\n\nShe glanced down again, lowering her head a bit more.\n\nIt looked like she was trying to punish the plate with her eyes.  If she could have made it explode and bloody my face, I have no doubt she would have.\n\nIt began to slide for a total of 4 inches.  It must have taken at least 2 seconds.\n\nIt was absolutely smooth.  No sudden start to try to overcome inertia, no ending slow down.\n\nNone of the jerky movements that a human would produce.\n\nIt moved like a motor was turning a smooth gear.\n\nOr like a very tiny fairy was pushing it with all of her might, and lucked out because of the soup under it.\n\nI've seen objects move on their own since then,  but I don't have any control over it.\n\nOnly Cholita seems to be able to command Fairy to move stuff.\n\nI was probably going to end up being able to do that, but Fairy spends nearly all of her time around Cholita now.\n\nI don't know if that's because Carlos planned her as an inorganic being receptacle, or because my obsession with protecting Cholita has caused Fairy to hang out with her most of the time.\n\nI suspect the soup helped  fairy out by allowing hydroplaning.\n\nBut Cholita put it there!\n\nAnd that's a re-occurring theme with Cholita.\n\nShe'll do something truly rude or horrible, and I'll be rewarded with a display of actual magic.\n\nIt's impossible to be angry with her.\n\nAt night, she walks visibly into my dark room, sometimes glowing as brightly as a full moon on a clear day.\n\nAnd she's friendly.\n\nBut in her Tonal, she's monstrous.\n\nFrom that episode, and seeing other things move, I've calculated the force Fairy can generate.\n\nIt's around 2 ounces.\n\nOur bathroom door keeps locking.\n\nShe can't push that lock hard enough to lock the door, but she can push on the door itself. It slowly builds up speed until it bumps into the wall, and pushes the lock.\n\nIt annoys the hell out of Cholita, who's taken the screws out of the mechanism which closes the door, so that even if locked it can't close.\n\nI've watched it move and lock itself, standing right there near it.\n\nAt the time the only thing you think is, where's the breeze coming from?\n\nMoving objects merely by looking at them is available to anyone reading this.\n\nMake friends with an inorganic being. Treat it respectfully like a friend.\n\nIt'll bring you to its world.\n\nThe first time you'll be frightened seeing so many of them, but just relax or you'll scare them away.\n\nThen use your hand to wave them towards you, and wave them back.\n\nPush and pull on them.\n\nBut you don't actually have to touch.  Just signaling it, with your hand positioned in the air to make it look like you are touching them, is good enough.\n\nThat way, you don't have to actually enter their world.  You can hang out just on the outside, and only reach in with your arm.\n\nHowever, I must admit to having pulled on one for real the first time.\n\nHe stretched.\n\nI felt bad for warping him like that, so I stopped actually pulling on them.\n\nI spoke with Cholita later on, about levitating the dim sum plate.\n\nShe said, \"What???  Am I Jesus now?  Do I have to save the world, and be the virgin sacrifice?  Will your little friends on reddit want to drink my blood?!?\"\n\nShe hasn't gone out to eat with me since then, and that was months ago.\n\nIf Cholita can provide proof for others, she'll refuse.\n\nShe doesn't need convincing.\n\nAnd she doesn't care about the blood suckers on reddit.\n\nAbout the whole situation Cholita said, \"Carlos is dead. It's over.  It was a beautiful thing, but you can't make it happen again.\"\n\nEdited", "edited": 1593906564.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fwy0qwu", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I did!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were having Chinese food.

I am here to kindly ask for some advice and answers from some practitioners here, especially from those who have a regular job (or freelance job, whatever).\n\nPrehistory 1. A friend of mine showed me this subreddit some time ago, I came here and found some interesting things. Started to do some practice. Then registered when understood that I have some questions. Now my account is 21 days old, so presumably I am allowed to ask about some things  according to the rules of this subreddit. \n\nPrehistory 2. I am not new to magic and everything and started my path when was \\~20 y.o. (or even earlier, but never practiced those days. Now I am \\~32). Then it was about hermeticism. Since then, I read many books and sources about different routes of sorcery (practiced some things with almost no effect), and stopping inner dialog (let me name it SID) was a common practice for almost any path that seemed to be realistic. So I consider it an important part anyway.\n\nSo, the hermetic path needs some discipline from you, and controlling the mind and emotions is the part of it. I didn't do much progress with sorcery, but do managed to fix some things in my inner self and got my life better, without vain anger, jealousy and so on. Also I was continuing to find some working way of sorcery. \n\nAs many, I read some of Carlos' Castaneda books. Some first books were pretty interesting. Then, when don Juan seemed to be gone, Carlos started to describe those gender... stories with witches and women around him and his judgments about everything happens, and I decided I'm done... Because I wasn't sure I should follow the path of the person I can't agree with.\n\nBut, some ideas from books were quite interesting, for example about lucid dreams. I had some when I was a child, but they were never intended and never I could do much there before I am out. A bunch of time passed till I managed to CAUSE a first intended lucid dream and make some things there. It happened not so long ago (this autumn), and CC books had nothing to do with it (rather, it's Michail Raduga's method, he's a russian lucid dreamer, if someone is interested). It's still hard anyway, but at least I know I am able. \n\nEnd of prehistory. Thanks for reading! Excuse me for being so wordy, but I would like to explain everything in advance. \n\nSo, I read through materials here and realized that probably missed many useful practices when decided not to go on with reading Carlos' books. And I want to thank everyone here who collected and tested techniques, and succeed enough to share their experience.\n\nWhen I read things here and started to practice myself, I discovered some interesting things (and just thoughts) about practices.\n\nFirst, about tensegrity. A great collection of movements that seem pretty much like morning exercises. But I already do morning exercises more or less regulary, and it seems tensegrity really has some greater impact on energy. Like, I've got energy and good mood for things I recently considered tedious and unpleasant. \n\nSecond, about SID. I already had some practice with it (and with my own thoughts and emotions) earlier, so - for years - there's no evil characters that command me, make me afraid or discourage from something. But, surely, I have inner voice and even can make it silent for some seconds. \n\nAnd one of the first thing you should do in practices - to make it silent, in general, all day long. For many days. And first thing I thought on after starting this SID practice, was... \"Why should you get rid of your own thinking? How you suppose to do any everyday activities that need your direct thoughts\"? I don't mean taking bath or cooking. I mean talking to people meaningfully, making some job that needs your active mind (projecting something, counting, reading books, problem solving and so on). It seems wrong to consider that only a jobless or retired (or country living) person with unlimited free time can do a sorcery, right?\n\nAlso SID seems to make time go slower (as you know, when you are a child, it's very slow, but when you're an adult, it becomes much faster). Also SID seems to make me a bit more disciplined and strong-willed, that helps me to fix things in my life that I haven't fixed yet.  \n\nThird, about Dark Room. Practice when you should stay or sit or make tensegrity in completely dark room with opened eyes and search for colors. Some person here wrote about bathroom, so it was a good idea first. But I have not a lot of space there (and also tiles are hard and cold even when I use a pillow), so I had to make dark my own room. I have no much progress in there unfortunately, though I've never made it for 3 hours for now. I was looking for puffs as adviced, but best things seen were \"yellow waves\" just before my eyes - they appear in some time after I start practice (maybe in 20-30 minutes), and they don't look like something in air, rather like simple eyes-working-effect, and disappear in some time, and I can't make them return.\n\nAlso I tried to do tensegrity in Dark Room, but it doesn't help to SID - rather I start to think on my every movement instead.\n\nFourth, about recapitulation. As said, it's the practice when you turn your head right and left regularly, inhaling and exhaling, with closed eyes (or opened in Dark Room), and try to remember any situations in details - from pleasant to painful ones, and to let it cover all your life. I tried it. I don't see a big different from a simple visualization. You can recall some memories, even in detail, you can even imagine there anything... What should be the point?\n\nFor years I was automatically and regularly rewinded back all my memories in order to remember everything in detail. Didn't visualized all the things, just recalled. Some years ago (when the war started here in Ukraine) I stopped doing this for some reason (even didn't notice it right away). Can't say how useful that remembering was at that time. I can only say that then a lot of things bothered me, but now they don\u2019t anymore. I don't feel any anger or anxiety or anything like that, just a little anxiety that my memory seems to have gotten a bit worse. For now, I don't know how recapitulation can help, because magic always was the most important thing throughout my life, I refused to believe in its absence and met many interesting people and the phenomena that confirmed this fact. \n\nUnfortunately, just 'knowing' doesn't make me a sorcerer. Still, I *have* to learn to do some things to push my life further, and it must be done. For example seeing energies (and it would be very good to learn how to see the energies not in darkness or 'recapitulation trance').\n\nSo, here are the questions finally. \n\n1. How do you combine a work that requires direct thinking and SID?\n\n2. Have you been experiencing something called \"world stop\", and which practices and time preceded this? (I ask just because I don't understand it clearly) How would you describe it? If world stops when some water is pouring or fire burning (for example) around, do those things stop also? Does it takes you to some other world automatically, so you don't see the impact on our reality?\n\n3. Will the assemblage point move simply because you are making tensegrity movements if you do not see the energy (or puffs) yet?\n\n(because I tried some, but I don't know if there are more and less useful movements for that purpose). \n\n4. Do the lucid dreams make some use to you? Me and my mate have a long tradition of remembering and telling dreams to each other, so it's not hard to remember a lucid dream also. I remember the feeling of complete clearance when you are inside, and it seems recapitulation+visualization strong effects should look the same... But in the end we return to this reality, to this body, people and events, and stay here, so we know where 'reality' is. Does daydreaming have an effect on anything other than the perception of reality?\n\nThank you. I will be happy to talk over any of things and take some advice if you kindly give me some.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Some practice discussion, asking for advice and sharing experience", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "New Practitioners"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1aq7yem", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_cen8p7ii", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "New Practitioners", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "spoiler", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1707866823.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone.

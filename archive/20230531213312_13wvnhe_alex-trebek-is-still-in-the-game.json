Standing?  Farting?\n\nIt doesn't mean any of those.\n\nIt means, the person making the comment is looking for approval from whoever gets stuck listening to it.\n\nAnd it summons images of a world of gossipy people talking about someone's butt size behind their back.\n\nIt also summons images of a woman facing away from a mirror, and turning her head to look backwards to see how it looks in a specific dress or pair of pants.\n\nIt's LOADED with endless meanings.\n\nThere's no way to think that statement, without lighting up a gigantic patch of emanations.\n\nAll tied to self-pity and attention seeking.\n\nIt's a \"command\" because it forces you to assemble a specific reality, or it makes no sense.\n\nIf you want to follow the conversation, you have no choice but to have all of those images in the mind.\n\nOtherwise, the syntax makes no sense.\n\nThus it's a \"Syntactic Command\".\n\nIt COMMANDS you to join humanity and \"feel\" what they feel.\n\nIt was so serious to Carlos, you could get tossed out of private classes for a poorly timed syntactic command.\n\nGood thing I'm not a moderator in the subreddit or I'd do the same.\n\nI suppose a lot of this might sound like Krishnamurti, the big time con artist re-using the Daoist delusion about \"stuff no one is superior enough to comprehend\".\n\nThat's one of the scams used to steal from people who seek magic.\n\nEvery fake magical system does it a tiny bit, claiming only their \"top\" people can comprehend some complete nonsense they use in their sales literature.\n\nAnd the Daoists are the archetype of that trick. Telling na\u00efve people something is so wise, it's hopeless for them to even try to understand it.\n\nBut if they could, they'd be above everyone else and happy forever!\n\nThis isn't like that at all.  This idea of a syntactic command.\n\nYou have to learn that sorcery is just a simple description of \"what is\"!\n\nIt's key to understanding it. It's all VERY SIMPLE. And straight forward.\n\nIt just takes a lot of work before you can visibly see what they're talking about.\n\nIt's not what someone wishes \"was\", or what someone wants to convince you \"is\" so they can empty your bank account.\n\nSorcerers could literally see the glow of awareness flow into a set of emanations that makes reality awful, and filled with self-pity. When someone engages a syntactic command.\n\nJust as, if you're driving down the street and see your former drug addict friend head for that seedy apartment complex where you just need to stand in the road that runs around the center, and someone runs over to you with drugs.  Seeing that, you know he's gone back to his self-destructive behavior.\n\nIt's not a complicated theory.  It's just something you see with your own eyes.\n\nSorcery is like that, and NOTHING like Krishnamurti's rants.\n\nSome Castaneda fans liked him back in private classes.\n\nBecause they were clueless.\n\nAnd Carlos constantly tried to \"give them a clue\" with his lectures on things like,\n\n\"Alex Trebek is Still in the Game\".\n\nNo one got it.\n\nA few might have even gone home to check Gurdjieff or Husserl writings, to see if that could explain it.\n\nWe're lost on the Island of Syntax, in the ocean of infinity.\n\nAnd we won't leave because they have ice cream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Alex Trebek Is Still in the Game", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 126, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"4f5ii3huc93b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 97, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4f5ii3huc93b1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a97caeecbb29c1ee5929154047bfff018620a20"}, {"y": 195, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4f5ii3huc93b1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e09a6fd864ac4781cf44be5a4be2d115d6e0361"}, {"y": 290, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4f5ii3huc93b1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=214cbc41c2ba9a28edae42aa7a2f2736adacd6e6"}], "s": {"y": 291, "x": 321, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/4f5ii3huc93b1.jpg?width=321&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adbd81fb6e76be884649de69aa938ef9e2691a42"}, "id": "4f5ii3huc93b1"}}, "name": "t3_13wvnhe", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/DO1kf4qh__Za9G3rXE-dxA2GtmZ874_c_3Si9UZnavk.jpg", "edited": 1685563533.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1685561592.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4f5ii3huc93b1.jpg?width=321&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=adbd81fb6e76be884649de69aa938ef9e2691a42\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/4f5ii3huc93b1.jpg?width=321&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=adbd81fb6e76be884649de69aa938ef9e2691a42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found this picture on my computer, but oddly it&amp;#39;s from 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, I remember Carlos lecturing us about it in the mid 90s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Jadey remembers it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos was trying to teach us about syntactic commands, like &amp;quot;My butt is too big!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know who was &amp;quot;Still in the Game&amp;quot;, but Carlos found it very amusing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see why now, but at the time it was a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s examine it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your butt is too big, what is it too big for?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sitting?

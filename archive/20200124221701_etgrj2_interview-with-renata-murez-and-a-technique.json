The tensegrity moves?\n\nThose aren't new. Those are really old.\n\nDidn't they make it into any workshops?\n\nThe infinity breath is a \"pouring\" technique. When you pour energy on yourself, or smear it, the rest of the lights in the room get stronger because your energy body glows more.  That's what lights up the outside: the inside.\n\nDidn't Renata actually say that in the video?\n\nHere's a tip:  You don't need to be so precise! In fact, just smear the damned stuff on you physically!\n\nDon't try to guide the hands just over the surface like you've got cooties and don't want to touch it.\n\nThe first time you see a solid color in darkness and manage to put your hand on it, and move it down to your stomach (which will require moving your eyes to make it move), push it down on your thigh, and smear it rapidly up and down.\n\nYou can make your whole leg glow purple!  And then you won't have to turn your head to make it move anymore.\n\nI'd call that infinity breath, a \"fussy\" technique.\n\nIt works.\n\nBut it infects your mind with stuffiness.\n\nJust watch the guy in the video do the technique.\n\nDo you really want to go have a beer with him?\n\nAnd, although I don't like people emphasizing breathing techniques, because I believe it's a death trap (a placebo that makes you think you're accomplishing something great, so you don't do what you really need to do), it is true that breathing in general causes some sort of expansion in the lights, and brings out finer details in the mist.  Like actual lines instead of just vague light.\n\nIn general, the techniques I've investigated do what Carlos said they do.\n\nUnfortunately,  there's too much to do, and any break in what you were doing the night before sets you back.\n\nYou can't just casually \"investigate\" something. It comes at a cost.\n\nI guess the best analogy would be one engineers can readily understand.\n\nWhen you're working on a very complicated engineering design, which requires you to keep 100 things in mind at all times, to navigate the next step,  even stopping for a day sets you back several days.\n\nIt's not just an interrupt of time. It's a loss of what you had stored up.\n\nAnd watching the tensegrity moves in darkness is not quite as satisfying as you'd think.\n\nIn order to *see* them, you have to be in a \"don't care\" mode.\n\nI supposed, \"Mr. Doubletake\" (the censoring function just below the images, below the internal dialogue) does what he does, using emotion.\n\nIt's your mom yelling at you.  Stop it!  Cut that out!\n\nLet's face it.  She did a number on you.\n\nA dark witch declawed you, by implanting an angry demon in your mind.\n\nCarlos called it, \"The fliers\".  I call it your mom.  Or dad in some cases.\n\nYou have to remove the emotional aspect of your reaction to things, to disarm Mr. Doubletake.\n\nThat means, the tensegrity isn't as exciting to *see* as you'd expect.\n\nIt's \"ho hum\".\n\nInorganic beings on the other hand are very exciting to *see*.  They know just what to do, to play that up.\n\nI'm afraid to say, it's a huge disadvantage when manipulating colors in darkness, if you don't have an inorganic to hang out with.\n\nSo far, the most impressive Tensegrity move to me is the 2nd dreaming technique of the Westwood series.\n\nIt produces floating dream scenes.\n\nWhat you'll see is that bending to look back like that, with the palms down in a kind of odd position, produces a build up of purple haze, with lines in it.  Any odd movement \"redeploys\" or \"stirs up\" energy.\n\nTensing the legs makes it move forward, just as he said, maybe because we're used to pushing things and helping out with the tension in our legs.  So we *intend* a movement forward because that's what were used to.\n\nIt doesn't exactly blow, like it was smoke. It sort of ripples forward, as if nothing is really moving.  It's only what's lighting them up that moves.\n\nIt's hard to look around without spoiling the technique, so you're likely to only *see* it on the side where your head is turned.\n\nWhen you look back to the front, you find a concentrated cloud around 1 foot from your waist. The cloud is around 2 feet in diameter, and parallel to the floor as if it were flat. But not hugely flat.\n\nIf you look into it wondering if it was there before (which you can do without internal dialogue), you'll see a head and torso pop in.\n\nOr a car.  Or a park with people playing ball.\n\nIt's a dream!  A full dreaming scene.  I'd guess that the people in that scene are around 6 inches tall.\n\nIt's not at all like finding an inorganic on a puff of color. Those are just them. And those animate very slowly, like 2 changes per second.\n\nOn the clouds of dreams activated by the Westwood series,  it's full speed movement.\n\nImagine if someone could make balls of smoke in the darkness, put a vague ultraviolet bulb in the room so that all the clouds were purplish, and then someone projected a bluish-grey video onto them.\n\nThat's what it looks like.\n\nCarlos never went into this kind of detail on things, and likely for a reason.\n\nBut we're past being secretive.  Things have gotten too bad out there, we need specificity.\n\nTo the Russians in particular I'd say, SHARE!!!\n\nDon't be secretive. Don't be weird!  Don't copy what you think Cleargreen management does.\n\nDon't be an asshole!\n\nEither you'll be a fake forever, or you'll make it work. If you make it work, you can only do half without a second person.\n\nAnd the chances of finding someone who will work hard enough to become your second person, is only 1 in 500.\n\nI only have a second person, because Carlos himself arranged it.\n\nSo you need to share, and help each other out.\n\nDon't behave like an angry tribe of gorillas.\n\nYou know how poorly that works in politics.\n\nAnd don't be like a stuck-up intellectual snob community.\n\nYou know how poorly that works out for science.\n\nJust ask Pasteur.\n\nEdited twice", "edited": 1579910530.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ffglgtz", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Maybe need to revisit it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which ones?

But not hugely flat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look into it wondering if it was there before (which you can do without internal dialogue), you&amp;#39;ll see a head and torso pop in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or a car.  Or a park with people playing ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a dream!  A full dreaming scene.  I&amp;#39;d guess that the people in that scene are around 6 inches tall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not at all like finding an inorganic on a puff of color. Those are just them. And those animate very slowly, like 2 changes per second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the clouds of dreams activated by the Westwood series,  it&amp;#39;s full speed movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine if someone could make balls of smoke in the darkness, put a vague ultraviolet bulb in the room so that all the clouds were purplish, and then someone projected a bluish-grey video onto them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos never went into this kind of detail on things, and likely for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#39;re past being secretive.  Things have gotten too bad out there, we need specificity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the Russians in particular I&amp;#39;d say, SHARE!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be secretive. Don&amp;#39;t be weird!  Don&amp;#39;t copy what you think Cleargreen management does.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be an asshole!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either you&amp;#39;ll be a fake forever, or you&amp;#39;ll make it work. If you make it work, you can only do half without a second person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the chances of finding someone who will work hard enough to become your second person, is only 1 in 500.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only have a second person, because Carlos himself arranged it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you need to share, and help each other out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t behave like an angry tribe of gorillas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know how poorly that works in politics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And don&amp;#39;t be like a stuck-up intellectual snob community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know how poorly that works out for science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just ask Pasteur.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/etgrj2/interview_with_renata_murez_and_a_technique/ffglgtz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1579908978.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_etgrj2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ffgfy9p", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1579905354.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_etgrj2", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Renata isn't bad either.

Those tend to prevent new information from coming in.  In fact, they're so pervasive in our daily lives that they nearly seem like some kind of \"plot\" by supernatural beings.\n\nCarlos proposed two versions of that.  \"Syntactic commands\", and \"the fliers\".\n\nEither theory is useful for learning, but neither really explains what you begin to notice when you experience Silent Knowledge directly enough times, to have a \"feeling for it\".\n\nIt becomes almost like a companion.  Because if you have a question or concern, you can end up getting an answer.  As if something external noticed you had a question, and just happened to have a good answer for you.\n\nLike one of those cop dramas where they have a goth nerd girl assistant.\n\nI can think of at least 3 shows with one of those.\n\nSo you're out there battling evil, run into a problem, and go downstairs to the basement to see what nerd girl is wearing today.  And to see what she has to say about your question.\n\nWhich turns out to be exactly what you needed to know.\n\nSilent Knowledge feels a little like that at times.  Which by the way, it could actually become if you wanted to waste the energy to \"intend\" it.\n\nYou can create phantom entities to feed you silent knowledge when desired. Like Porfirio, the plant expert who doesn't really exist, or even talking lizards who can answer any question you ask.\n\nSeers by the way have the advantage over Men of Knowledge, in that they can design the rituals that the Men of Knowledge only learned.\n\nThe Men of Knowledge were \"handed down\" their rituals, which required power plants and an Ally to work.\n\nThe ritual summoned the force of intent to repeat past events, the power plants moved the participants assemblage point to the bottom of the back, and the Ally made sure there was an organized intelligence reaching up into Silent Knowledge, to bring it to the participant in the prescribed form.\n\nTalking lizards for example.\n\nBut as seers, we don't need the rituals.  We can simply \"see\" the truth of it.  Get Silent Knowledge directly from the source in just about any format you can imagine.\n\nVideos in the air, announcer \"voices\" explaining.  Even \"guest stars\" can show up in Silent Knowledge mode.\n\nIt's so flexible that don Juan himself, in the Silent Knowledge publication, advises Carlos that written text might be a good choice for the presentation method.\n\nI personally think he and Carlos just didn't want us cooking up a duplicate of them for our \"presentation method\".\n\nIt would have to be able to \"tug\" on their awareness, even after they had gone from the organic body existence.\n\nIn lecture notes, you'll even find the witches saying Carlos had \"too many people speaking his name\".\n\nAnd that was pulling on him in annoying ways.\n\nThere's an old theater device which is kind of cheesy,  but common.\n\nThe actor will turn to the audience and make a joke about the play.  As if the audience were a supernatural viewer of events, and as the lead character he alone was aware of their presence.\n\nAware of an intelligence outside the reality of the play, to which the actor could appeal.\n\nIn this case, the recommendation of don Juan to channel silent knowledge (\"seeing\") as text, had the real world recommendation from Carlos also, to seek that out.\n\nHe even gave it a \"bad ass\" name.  \"Readers of Infinity\".\n\nThat concept includes \"The Whorl\" that spits out text, the stories of Carlos reading \"notes\" on his palm which could give him knowledge about any random topic, even super technical ones, and even him using that ability in private classes, reading entire paragraphs out of thin air just above the horizon to the south of us.\n\nOr south east. I still haven't pinpointed the direction he favored to look during private classes, when he needed to \"see\" what to tell us that moment.  I need to go back to Dance Home, with a cell phone compass to judge the direction.\n\nBetween the two of them,  don Juan and Carlos, that recommendation to read text instead of having some kind of phantom supernatural being like Porfirio, almost feels like \"an aside\" to me.  That one of the actors in a story becomes aware of the audience and makes a comment directly to them, turning his head away from the main action in the story, to look at the audience.\n\nThere's a bunch of that in the books.  It just isn't quite visible, until you remove all the \"glosses\" blinding us to most of reality.\n\nWe know the \"doings of books\", and books can't turn their head to look at the reader so they can make an amusing comment about the story.\n\nIf this isn't clear,  consider that our very existence puts us in that situation.\n\n\"The Spirit\" can gift us, when the flow of our own personal story amuses it, and it can help out by participating in the story a tiny bit.  Tip events one way or the other, perhaps just by influencing which emanations get skimmed.\n\nBut you can even \"goad\" the Eagle to do that on demand.  \"Your command becomes the eagle's command\".\n\nThe rules for causing this to happen are usually thought of as \"the rules of successful intending\".\n\nThere's a touch of malicious humor recommended to be included in there, along with some boldness.\n\nI suppose the most drastic but classic example is when the Nagual Julian tosses don Juan into the raging river, to a certain death by drowning, teasing him not to \"hate the river\" as he flies through the air into the water.\n\nThe apprentices seemed to cry for at least a full day, certain don Juan was dead.\n\nBut his double pops out while he's helpless in the river, and helps him escape death.\n\nI suppose since I mentioned beginners, keep in mind that there's not even a trace of religion in sorcery.\n\nNot even \"beliefs\".\n\nIt is merely a technology, developed by the Olmec.\n\nBecause we're drowning in fake religions and pretend magic in our own modern existence, it's nearly impossible to see the topic of sorcery as anything other than a bizarre religion.\n\nBut it's not. It's closer to computer technology.\n\nThere's nothing to \"believe\" when putting a motherboard into a case, with power supply, hard drive, and a super powerful video card, in order to produce a good gaming machine for your own use.\n\nYou don't confuse the games you play, with the machine you built.\n\nThat's just technology.  No \"beliefs\" or feelings about it, are relevant.\n\nSame for sorcery, despite our learned expectations regarding anything that involves magic.\n\nA whole other topic that could be expanded on to help beginners stop making mistakes in understanding.  But since the post would soon be buried and no beginners would read it anymore, it's pointless.\n\nThe books take care of that by informing us that there are \"abstract cores\", which are stories, and those always repeat in every detail of a sorcerers learning process.\n\nWe're on the alert for the fact that the story in the books, will behave sort of like an actor engaged in an \"aside\", taking a moment out from the story to comment to the audience about it.\n\nWe're made to be a tiny bit paranoid about events that unfold.\n\nExcept instead of being religious about it, for instance by suggesting that \"God has a plan for everyone\", it's more of a technical thing.  That reality is built from latent awareness flowing on the emanations, which are used to select the final bundle that builds our view of things.\n\nIts a mechanical view of something that very much feels religious. That we are partially controlled by \"fate\".\n\nI'm trying to \"point\" to what I'd like to ask you all, just to survey understanding in general.\n\nIf any new people want to jump in and use this \"opportunity\" to build up your own reputation, please don't.\n\nI've concluded that the young men who come here are often chimp like in their behavior.\n\nThey're like teenage male chimps, watching the most powerful adult chimps in the \"tribe\".\n\nThey collect together and grumble with their fellow teenage chimps just far enough out of viewing range, so that the older chimps don't notice them.  There they bare their teeth among themselves in disdain of the most powerful chimps, and work themselves up into an attack mode frenzy.\n\nThree or four entire subreddits were created by angry chimps who had to be tossed out of here, just so they could continue baring their teeth at this subreddit.\n\nWe call them \"the angry subreddits\", the most famous of which is \"batman's cave\".\n\nBut batman was such an awful chimp, I believe even reddit cast him out.\n\nThose teenage chimps snarl and threaten on the side, waiting for what seems to be to be a weakness in one of the powerful leader chimps,  at which point they'll leap into the middle of the action, and beat their chest.\n\nAnd poor techno has to ban them for a while.\n\nFrankly, they didn't even belong commenting and posting in here.  They'd learn a lot faster if they couldn't threaten others.  And reddit never blocks people from seeing the posts, so no one is prevented from learning.\n\nOnly from attention seeking.\n\nIt's completely horrible that this subreddit has to deal with that.  With young men who come here only to thump their chest, and don't have an actual interest in learning.\n\nThey want to threaten and bully their way to the top of some imaginary hill, so their heads can rise a tiny bit above it relative to others.\n\nThe mods even keep that in mind when aggressive angry behavior pops up in here.\n\nYou'll notice them discussing in private chat, \"Could be a teenager\".\n\nAs if that excused it.\n\nThey're really saying, \"That bunch of angry chimps over there are all trying to make a name for themselves in the chimp tribe, because ultimately it gets them more choice of female chimps, and first shot at new found food.\"\n\nHad to ban one of those aggressive male chimps just this afternoon.\n\nSo please, don't anyone jump in and start beating your chest.  Anyone who reads this post will be looking at answers with that in mind.  If there were an angry chimp award, we could mark some responses with it.\n\nAnd maybe, if your user name implies you're a very powerful and dangerous teenage chimp,  keep out of it?\n\nWe don't need any user IDs like \"Bad\\_Ass\\_Chimp\" to respond.\n\nOr \"Nagual\\_Chimp\".  You'd have to be a teenager to think no one sees through those types of IDs instantly.\n\nIt's one of the criteria for spotting bad players.   Just noticing them comment with such an ugly username, reveals their fangs threatening you to obey and not cross them.\n\nDoesn't work in this subreddit!\n\nSo, if the well behaved chimps wanted to answer, I'd love to know something.\n\nWhen don Juan told Carlos, in the later publications, that he \"had high hopes for muscle memory\" to teach us sorcery via tensegrity, what does that mean to you?\n\nHow did you interpret that?\n\nDon't rethink it.  I could surely add some Silent Knowledge details on the topic, to make you question what you believed.\n\nBut I'm more interested in how people understood it, if they thought about it at all.\n\nAnd I'll point out, Carlos brought it up in private class lectures.\n\nAnd he was well aware of the \"evil clown effect\".\n\nThat's where if you tell people to be careful because the inorganic beings like to frighten humans on first contact, and evil clowns are among their favorite \"looks\", then for as long as the memory of that is floating around, new people will perceive evil clowns threatening them when they encounter an Ally.\n\nLikewise, Carlos deliberately implanted the idea of \"muscle memory\" in our minds, as a possible \"secret\" to learning sorcery faster.\n\nWhich means, while doing the tensegrity forms those who are most serious about learning have likely tried to tap into the muscle memory aspect.\n\nHow did they try to do that?\n\nI'll give my own \"prejudice\" because it won't interfere with your answers much.\n\nI didn't actually think about what muscle memory is too much, but instead remembered that someone who is very good at martial arts sparring, and does it often, will eventually find that their blocks of attacks become automatic.\n\nThe guy kicks, and you're surprised to find you are now holding his leg with your arm wedged up, so that he's off balance.\n\nYour body \"caught\" his leg as it tried to kick you, the same way your hand might catch a glass about to fall off the dinner table, before you even realize the situation.\n\nI thought that if you could only focus on that process, you might tie into the \"lizard mind\", and that might silence the internal dialogue a bit.\n\nSo the question is, what exactly did don Juan hope for, with his idea that muscle memory might help us succeed in learning?\n\nSince I'm assuming beginners will read this, far more goes on in sorcery as it progresses, than you can possibly imagine.\n\nI wasn't even inside my darkroom anymore when I decided to stop for a bit and type this post in.\n\nI was off past the walls of the room, looking at odd beings floating in the air. Literally, \"outside\" reality as we know it.\n\nLike a nerd scientist in a far away cave, studying the worms that live along the walls there.\n\nI noticed a \"worm pattern\", and had to go ask my fellow \"wormologists\" if they'd noticed that before, because I sure missed it.\n\nSo I'm up to my knees in bat guano right now.   Don't assume I just got up from watching NCIS reruns because I got bored with the nerd goth girl, and wanted to chat everyone up.\n\nI gave up watching some very interesting worms, to post this question.", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What Did Don Juan Mean by \"Muscle Memory\"?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 96, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"wmq8324m0r491": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 74, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wmq8324m0r491.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6252ce37915a0bf80a156a22b61438ffdabfcee6"}, {"y": 149, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wmq8324m0r491.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d622c4fbac32ab049cf56753018c4a9910a567b5"}, {"y": 221, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wmq8324m0r491.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbd60cb8069e0a00dac0d36ea380e6824d48e168"}, {"y": 443, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wmq8324m0r491.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a45ae15a6fc8300071661df69579fa832cae4358"}], "s": {"y": 554, "x": 800, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/wmq8324m0r491.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68fc6c817d364c9c3ee487b4249f82400dbce70b"}, "id": "wmq8324m0r491"}}, "name": "t3_v92ff8", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/UOkOOWtpmq5J8eCqfF8-Rz444MnD3g6Y-QT05OX86W4.jpg", "edited": 1654848045.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1654847031.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/wmq8324m0r491.png?width=800&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=68fc6c817d364c9c3ee487b4249f82400dbce70b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/wmq8324m0r491.png?width=800&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=68fc6c817d364c9c3ee487b4249f82400dbce70b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you keep pushing until you are experiencing the world daily out there at the far end of the J curve, you begin to notice that some things mentioned in the books of Carlos and the witches are nearly &amp;quot;prophetic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that beginners are likely to misinterpret this, according to religious prejudices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to try to talk them out of that, I&amp;#39;d have to offend their religious prejudices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a river of shit vicious thought loop!

That we are partially controlled by &amp;quot;fate&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to &amp;quot;point&amp;quot; to what I&amp;#39;d like to ask you all, just to survey understanding in general.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If any new people want to jump in and use this &amp;quot;opportunity&amp;quot; to build up your own reputation, please don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve concluded that the young men who come here are often chimp like in their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re like teenage male chimps, watching the most powerful adult chimps in the &amp;quot;tribe&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They collect together and grumble with their fellow teenage chimps just far enough out of viewing range, so that the older chimps don&amp;#39;t notice them.  There they bare their teeth among themselves in disdain of the most powerful chimps, and work themselves up into an attack mode frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three or four entire subreddits were created by angry chimps who had to be tossed out of here, just so they could continue baring their teeth at this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We call them &amp;quot;the angry subreddits&amp;quot;, the most famous of which is &amp;quot;batman&amp;#39;s cave&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But batman was such an awful chimp, I believe even reddit cast him out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those teenage chimps snarl and threaten on the side, waiting for what seems to be to be a weakness in one of the powerful leader chimps,  at which point they&amp;#39;ll leap into the middle of the action, and beat their chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And poor techno has to ban them for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, they didn&amp;#39;t even belong commenting and posting in here.  They&amp;#39;d learn a lot faster if they couldn&amp;#39;t threaten others.  And reddit never blocks people from seeing the posts, so no one is prevented from learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only from attention seeking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s completely horrible that this subreddit has to deal with that.  With young men who come here only to thump their chest, and don&amp;#39;t have an actual interest in learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They want to threaten and bully their way to the top of some imaginary hill, so their heads can rise a tiny bit above it relative to others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mods even keep that in mind when aggressive angry behavior pops up in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll notice them discussing in private chat, &amp;quot;Could be a teenager&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As if that excused it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re really saying, &amp;quot;That bunch of angry chimps over there are all trying to make a name for themselves in the chimp tribe, because ultimately it gets them more choice of female chimps, and first shot at new found food.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Had to ban one of those aggressive male chimps just this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So please, don&amp;#39;t anyone jump in and start beating your chest.  Anyone who reads this post will be looking at answers with that in mind.  If there were an angry chimp award, we could mark some responses with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And maybe, if your user name implies you&amp;#39;re a very powerful and dangerous teenage chimp,  keep out of it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t need any user IDs like &amp;quot;Bad_Ass_Chimp&amp;quot; to respond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or &amp;quot;Nagual_Chimp&amp;quot;.  You&amp;#39;d have to be a teenager to think no one sees through those types of IDs instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s one of the criteria for spotting bad players.   Just noticing them comment with such an ugly username, reveals their fangs threatening you to obey and not cross them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t work in this subreddit!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if the well behaved chimps wanted to answer, I&amp;#39;d love to know something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When don Juan told Carlos, in the later publications, that he &amp;quot;had high hopes for muscle memory&amp;quot; to teach us sorcery via tensegrity, what does that mean to you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did you interpret that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t rethink it.  I could surely add some Silent Knowledge details on the topic, to make you question what you believed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m more interested in how people understood it, if they thought about it at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ll point out, Carlos brought it up in private class lectures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he was well aware of the &amp;quot;evil clown effect&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where if you tell people to be careful because the inorganic beings like to frighten humans on first contact, and evil clowns are among their favorite &amp;quot;looks&amp;quot;, then for as long as the memory of that is floating around, new people will perceive evil clowns threatening them when they encounter an Ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Carlos deliberately implanted the idea of &amp;quot;muscle memory&amp;quot; in our minds, as a possible &amp;quot;secret&amp;quot; to learning sorcery faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, while doing the tensegrity forms those who are most serious about learning have likely tried to tap into the muscle memory aspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How did they try to do that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll give my own &amp;quot;prejudice&amp;quot; because it won&amp;#39;t interfere with your answers much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t actually think about what muscle memory is too much, but instead remembered that someone who is very good at martial arts sparring, and does it often, will eventually find that their blocks of attacks become automatic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guy kicks, and you&amp;#39;re surprised to find you are now holding his leg with your arm wedged up, so that he&amp;#39;s off balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your body &amp;quot;caught&amp;quot; his leg as it tried to kick you, the same way your hand might catch a glass about to fall off the dinner table, before you even realize the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought that if you could only focus on that process, you might tie into the &amp;quot;lizard mind&amp;quot;, and that might silence the internal dialogue a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the question is, what exactly did don Juan hope for, with his idea that muscle memory might help us succeed in learning?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#39;m assuming beginners will read this, far more goes on in sorcery as it progresses, than you can possibly imagine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t even inside my darkroom anymore when I decided to stop for a bit and type this post in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was off past the walls of the room, looking at odd beings floating in the air. Literally, &amp;quot;outside&amp;quot; reality as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a nerd scientist in a far away cave, studying the worms that live along the walls there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I noticed a &amp;quot;worm pattern&amp;quot;, and had to go ask my fellow &amp;quot;wormologists&amp;quot; if they&amp;#39;d noticed that before, because I sure missed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m up to my knees in bat guano right now.   Don&amp;#39;t assume I just got up from watching NCIS reruns because I got bored with the nerd goth girl, and wanted to chat everyone up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gave up watching some very interesting worms, to post this question.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "v92ff8", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 37, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/v92ff8/what_did_don_juan_mean_by_muscle_memory/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/v92ff8/what_did_don_juan_mean_by_muscle_memory/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1654847031.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ibxzq0j", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1654924695.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_v92ff8", "score": 10, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "So, the answer to the mystery of \"muscle memory\"?\n\nI'm afraid I have to put it in the advanced subreddit, with some kind of warning not to read it unless you accept the consequences.\n\nYou can't \"undo\" looking at muscle memory from a different point of view.\n\nI will say however, that there's some spanish media notes on those large calf muscles Carlos had from doing the \"gait of power\" all over the hills of Mexico.  And not too far from the locations mentioned in the books!\n\nThat's one of the most important pieces of evidence about don Juan I know of.\n\nThat Carlos  REALLY WAS practicing seemingly pointless things like a weird goosestep walking method.\n\nOne way you can know a fake magic con man is that if you could be around them, you'd realize they don't actually practice what they pitch at fake workshops, beyond what's needed to keep the con game looking realistic.\n\nIt's almost the same thing as fake astral travel junkies not admitting upfront the actual nature of their \"achievements\".\n\nIt's always going to be the once every 6 months if you are lucky, for 10 minutes, and then spend the time to the next random weird experience, making up stuff about the last one.\n\nIt's all just a talking point.\n\nContrast that with the weird goosestep of the gait of power turning out to clue you in to \"muscle memory\", so that when you practiced it, you could \"connect\" to that alternate \"thought process\".\n\nA more \"primitive\" one.\n\nOne which can't support an internal dialogue of any sort at all, because it doesn't have that \"add-on\" card.\n\nThink of what we consider to be \"us\", in terms of a thought process.\n\nLet that be the \"main processor\", going back to the first Intel personal computer.   The old 4.7MHz 8088.\n\nNot the fancy \"turbo\" one that ran an astounding 10MHz.\n\nSo we had a nearly useless CPU in the first personal computer, and then Intel said, \"You know, math is what computers are really all about!  Let's put a co-processor in there, which does floating point directly!!!\"\n\nReally?  Wouldn't faster just solve that problem, since you can make a floating point subroutine?\n\nBut it was good  for my illustrative example of muscle memory.\n\nJust keep in mind, the muscle memory likely came before the main cpu in the case of evolving beings like us out of organic matter.\n\nFirst get those muscles working, and then maybe later we can learn to read Socrates.\n\nBut we're all stuck in \"Socrates Mode\".\n\nGoing around flinging shit in others faces, over violations of the \"rules of superiority\" of a philosopher.\n\nBut what if Socrates had taken up javelin throwing instead?\n\nHe'd be using a much different part of his brain.\n\nAnd that one would become his guide for that activity.\n\nIn fact, in some fighting styles (maybe all), the \"Socrates\" part of the brain is considered inferior.  Too slow, too confused.  Vunerable to being overwhealmed by fierceness from an opponent.\n\nIt \"flinches\", rather than simply \"react\".\n\nMain thought process:  Mr. Flincher.  Too smart for his own good.\n\nMuscle memory:  Mr. Reacter.  And three times the speed of the main thought process, for recognizing things going on around you, which might hurt like hell.  And so need fast muscle memory reponse to remove the perceived threat.  Like fingers burning on something.  Hand pulls back even before you say, \"Hot, Hot, Hot!!!\"\n\nThe \"main thought process\" is something you want to eliminate during battle.  Save it for when the bad guy is dead, and you need a funny 1 liner to say over his dead body.\n\nIt's the old, \"Empty your Cup grasshopper\", wise Chinese guy.\n\nHe could have just explained it in the same terms we do:  Eliminate the Internal Dialogue.\n\nBut then his students might actually learn what he's pretending to pitch to them, and he'd go out of business.  They wouldn't need him anymore.\n\nIn our case, we don't just declare victory at the green zone, the way Asian systems do.\n\nWe're trying to get to purple town.  To Silent Knowledge.\n\nA long ways from the green slime area of the J curve.\n\nAnd out there in the purple,  it's completely silent.\n\nAnd, there's no need to think at all.\n\nYou just \"notice\" or \"wonder\", and Silent Knowledge supplies the answer.\n\nIts possible that the only reason we developed such a complex thought process, is because Silent Knowledge has 1 trillion trillion pieces of \"knowledge\" available.\n\nOr \"zillion\" as Carlos liked to say, since there's no way to understand numbers that  high.\n\nAssuming our \"main thought process\" is useless over in Silent Knowledge mode, like thinking about rising gas prices is useless for enjoying the breeze at the beach, one might ask what's left of \"us\" out there.  In SK land.\n\nTensegrity is what's left.\n\nThat second CPU.\n\nCaveat: there may be a lot more than 2 CPUs in us!\n\nBut two we already \"know of\".\n\nAnd the second one we neglect, is part of \"muscle memory\".  Muscle memory is sentient.\n\nOr, \"the gait of power\" if you like.  That's like an embodiment of it.  Something you could use to \"embrace it\".\n\nThe gait of power is of course a very specific tensegrity pass,  and they all have their results.\n\nBut that one \"gets you around\", so you can try out that secondary processor.  It's \"co-processor based transportation\".\n\nThat \"physically oriented\" co-processor is the one we completely ignore, in favor of trying to puzzle out what we'd like SK to channel to us.\n\nA good point here, is someone asking if you could correct history using Silent Knowledge.\n\nYes, but that's the crummy main cpu, thinking about something as profound as silent knowledge.\n\nAnd thus \"death to silent knowledge\".\n\nThe two are incompatible.  Experiencing it, versus trying to profit from it.\n\nA sorcerer capable of balancing the two, the merchant mind, and the emptiness needed to channel pure SK, would no longer even consider doing something like, \"correcting history\".\n\nSame way that by the time he could do that, he could kill someone on the spot using his magic alone.\n\nSomeone that advanced no longer has desires like that.  I'm paraphrasing don Juan there.\n\nHow about an analogy to show the difference between our main thought process, and muscle memory?\n\nA little orphan kid is starving to death.  The all you can eat buffet restaurant owner decides to take pity, and lets him come in and have a free binge on everything they have.\n\nThat kid runs for the nearest food item, and starts stuffing his mouth.\n\nThat's the spirit of muscle memory.\n\nMeanwhile a rotten spoiled little kid, son of the wealthiest family in town,  is \"slumming it\" today because his parents wanted him to see how \"the other half lives\".\n\nSo little Edward walks in and turns up his nose at it all.  He's walking around the entire buffet with an empty plate, making jokes about what kind of person would eat that particular dish.\n\nThat's the non-muscle memory part of our thought process.\n\nSo tensegrity turns you into a starving orphan?\n\nSo you end up wearing black everywhere, with cropped hair and no makeup, like a chacmool?\n\nYes, maybe it does.  That's also a hint at what muscle memory is like.\n\nIt's the \"Kylie Fierceness\".   She ain't thinking about Socrates when she has that fierce gaze going.  It's more like \"Puma\" thinking.\n\nAnother hint at how sorcerers perhaps understand \"muscle memory\" is in that Olmec figurine, \"the wrestler\".  The sorcerer in that figurine is almost taunting the viewers about what physical posture can do.\n\nBut who do you suppose has more fun, once the buffet is closed?\n\nEdward, or the orphan boy?\n\nThe clue to what sorcerers meant by \"muscle memory\", at least in part,  is in all that.\n\nIt has odd consequences if you can \"switch over to it\".  It turns out that the secondary CPU in our example, has access to the computer's live camera and can watch the real world.  And \"understand\" too.\n\nSwitching to that unlocks more darkroom sights you haven't seen since childhood.\n\nBack when the muscle memory still had a say in things.\n\nBack when you were still stuffing your little foot into your mouth, so you could suck on the toes while you watched all the wonder around you in perfect silence.", "edited": 1654927402.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_ibxzq0j", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the answer to the mystery of &amp;quot;muscle memory&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid I have to put it in the advanced subreddit, with some kind of warning not to read it unless you accept the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;undo&amp;quot; looking at muscle memory from a different point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will say however, that there&amp;#39;s some spanish media notes on those large calf muscles Carlos had from doing the &amp;quot;gait of power&amp;quot; all over the hills of Mexico.

Muscle memory is sentient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, &amp;quot;the gait of power&amp;quot; if you like.  That&amp;#39;s like an embodiment of it.  Something you could use to &amp;quot;embrace it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gait of power is of course a very specific tensegrity pass,  and they all have their results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that one &amp;quot;gets you around&amp;quot;, so you can try out that secondary processor.  It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;co-processor based transportation&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That &amp;quot;physically oriented&amp;quot; co-processor is the one we completely ignore, in favor of trying to puzzle out what we&amp;#39;d like SK to channel to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A good point here, is someone asking if you could correct history using Silent Knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, but that&amp;#39;s the crummy main cpu, thinking about something as profound as silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And thus &amp;quot;death to silent knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two are incompatible.  Experiencing it, versus trying to profit from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sorcerer capable of balancing the two, the merchant mind, and the emptiness needed to channel pure SK, would no longer even consider doing something like, &amp;quot;correcting history&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same way that by the time he could do that, he could kill someone on the spot using his magic alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone that advanced no longer has desires like that.  I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing don Juan there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How about an analogy to show the difference between our main thought process, and muscle memory?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little orphan kid is starving to death.  The all you can eat buffet restaurant owner decides to take pity, and lets him come in and have a free binge on everything they have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That kid runs for the nearest food item, and starts stuffing his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the spirit of muscle memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile a rotten spoiled little kid, son of the wealthiest family in town,  is &amp;quot;slumming it&amp;quot; today because his parents wanted him to see how &amp;quot;the other half lives&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So little Edward walks in and turns up his nose at it all.  He&amp;#39;s walking around the entire buffet with an empty plate, making jokes about what kind of person would eat that particular dish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the non-muscle memory part of our thought process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So tensegrity turns you into a starving orphan?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you end up wearing black everywhere, with cropped hair and no makeup, like a chacmool?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, maybe it does.  That&amp;#39;s also a hint at what muscle memory is like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;Kylie Fierceness&amp;quot;.   She ain&amp;#39;t thinking about Socrates when she has that fierce gaze going.  It&amp;#39;s more like &amp;quot;Puma&amp;quot; thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another hint at how sorcerers perhaps understand &amp;quot;muscle memory&amp;quot; is in that Olmec figurine, &amp;quot;the wrestler&amp;quot;.  The sorcerer in that figurine is almost taunting the viewers about what physical posture can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But who do you suppose has more fun, once the buffet is closed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edward, or the orphan boy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The clue to what sorcerers meant by &amp;quot;muscle memory&amp;quot;, at least in part,  is in all that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It has odd consequences if you can &amp;quot;switch over to it&amp;quot;.  It turns out that the secondary CPU in our example, has access to the computer&amp;#39;s live camera and can watch the real world.  And &amp;quot;understand&amp;quot; too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Switching to that unlocks more darkroom sights you haven&amp;#39;t seen since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back when the muscle memory still had a say in things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back when you were still stuffing your little foot into your mouth, so you could suck on the toes while you watched all the wonder around you in perfect silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/v92ff8/what_did_don_juan_mean_by_muscle_memory/ibxzq0j/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1654924695.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_v92ff8", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 10}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 6, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_v92ff8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_v92ff8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"total_awards_received": 0, "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_v92ff8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ibvtl46", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "[deleted]", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ibvmn91", "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "all_awardings": [], "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "body": "Incredible I believe you.

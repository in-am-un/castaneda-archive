Most people who claim they are interested in such things are really just interested in getting attention and money from others, based on having \"super powers\".\n\nThat type of pretending has destroyed all systems of magic. Greedy men figure out how to fool others, by copying words from the past.\n\nCarlos called that, \"Mental Masturbation\" in private classes. Towards the end, when it was clear he was going to die before successfully teaching sorcery to anyone, he lamented of his private classes, \"They're all masturbators!\"\n\nIf you're saving up sexual energy, doing chi gung, claiming the \"kundalini is rising\", you are a victim. Not a practitioner.\n\nThere's nothing to practice anymore! Those systems are dead.\n\nJust look around! It's so obvious. Where are their students, comparing notes and sharing tips to do real magic?\n\nThere are none. You only get the smiling \"wise\" guru. Now why would you follow someone, who is unable to lead? And who wants constant money, to support an activity he never does.\n\nEven the famous Yogananda never managed to teach anyone. After his book filled with seductive bragging, he couldn't deliver.\n\nBut what exactly is \"energy\" in a functioning magical system?\n\nBeats me. Probably we can't know such things.\n\nBut you can observe the results of having energy, versus not having it!\n\nI'll venture a guess on what energy really is, from a very limited perspective.\n\nThere's only 2 things in the universe.\n\nThe emanations, and awareness.\n\nEverything else is a result of those 2. Even your physical being.\n\nAwareness is a glow the runs along the emanations.\n\nThe emanations are all different. Each one gives off a certain \"feeling\", when awareness flows along it. There are an infinite number of emanations, but we only have access to a small range.\n\nEven so, it's enough for 1000 unique lifetimes.\n\nDon't ask me \"what does the feeling part of the emanations, actually feel like?\"\n\nAgain, I don't know. I've felt individual emanations, but it's a very difficult thing to do. They tend to \"clump\" together, and isolating a single one is very difficult.\n\nIt takes, \"energy\".\n\nBut in that imaginary system I just defined, where there are only 2 things in existence, \"energy\" is how much awareness you can focus before you get tired and want to rest.\n\nIn sorcery, awareness is how far you can go when you are learning something new before you have to stop for the day.\n\nThe problem with \"energy\" is that you have to be using it, to notice it.\n\nYou can generally \"feel\" your current state, and say, \"I feel good today!\".\n\nOr, \"I don't feel so well.\"\n\nBut still, that's not energy.\n\nThat's the result of which particular emanations are glowing, with the awareness you were given when you were created as a bubble, on the emanations.\n\nUsing the energy of awareness, you can shift that assemblage point, and change your state of being.\n\nYou can even transform into something else.\n\nFor that reason, \"how you feel\" is not energy.\n\nSo how can you learn about \"energy\"?\n\nAnd does a Yogi, Buddhist, Daoist, or a Chi Gung practitioner, actually have more \"energy\", even if they misunderstand what it is?\n\nNo. When your energy rises above your knees, you automatically become a sorcerer.\n\nYou don't become any of those other things. Those are false myths, created to get money.\n\nSo let me tell you how to learn what energy is. Directly from your own undeniable experience.\n\nYou have to learn to perceive the second attention, and then learn to move the assemblage point.\n\n\"Energy\" is how long you can sustain that perception, and that determines how far you can move the assemblage point while doing it.\n\nIt's possible that's the only way you will ever actually understand the concept of \"energy\". By \"doing\", instead of \"thinking\".\n\nIn the books it's called, \"dreaming energy\" more than a few times.\n\nThat's a refinement of the term, because there's really only one type of energy, as far as sorcery goes.\n\nWe're told, we have to become \"misers\" with our energy, if we want to learn sorcery.\n\nBut if you don't understand what energy is in the first place, how can you learn to conserve it?\n\nIt all gets down to that ability to perceive the second attention, and then the ability to move your assemblage point.\n\nI'll give you several ways to learn what \"energy\" is, from least reliable, to most reliable. Unfortunately, the most reliable method requires that you can \"see energy\", as defined by Carlos in his \"Silent Knowledge\" publication. It was his late minute instructions to us, because he was dying.\n\nLeast reliable way: Lucid dreaming. It does in fact take \"energy\" to wake up in a dream, and become lucid. But don't be confused. It's not the energy which causes you to become lucid. It's not your greatness, or your technique or anything you did.\n\nIntent is what wakes you up in dreaming.\n\nBut it's just a small voice. A light tap on the shoulder.\n\nTo take advantage of that \"chance\" requires energy on your part.\n\nAnd then, to sustain the lucidity also requires energy. Someone who has done a significant amount of lucid dreaming will have at least a \"feeling\" of what energy is.\n\nBut it's still too vague.\n\nThe next method, slightly more reliable, is to simply do your favorite meditation technique, until you can \"see the room with your eyes closed\".\n\nThat's the second attention. It's become active.\n\nHow long you can watch it before you lose sight of it, or forget to keep watching and return to meditation or self-reflection, is determined by how much \"energy\" you have.\n\nBut it's still not a very precise understanding.\n\nA more reliable way to learn what energy is, involves forcing yourself silent in a chair with your eyes closed.\n\nIt's meditation on steroids! Super meditation. And according to Shinzen Young, it's the fastest path to enlightenment of all.\n\nPeople virtually never do it because it really hurts to force that internal dialogue off. It's easier to \"lull\" it off, with a weak meditation technique as a substitute for silence. The meditation technique merely \"replaces\" the internal dialogue, which is why virtually no one who practices meditation ever reaches enlightenment. If you belonged to a meditation group for 10 years or more, you know first hand that no one reaches enlightenment. The leaders just take your cash, and that's it. But you do get a taste of what it's like, if you could get rid of that internal dialogue.\n\nIf you force off the internal dialogue yourself, instead of relying on a \"replacement\" dialogue (mantra or sutra), at first you'll fall asleep. You'll be sitting in the chair, suffering horribly while trying to purge all words from your mind. Then you'll doze off, your chin will hit your chest, you'll wake up and curse yourself for failing.\n\nYou DIDN'T fail! That's a success. You're now able to learn what energy really is.\n\nJust keep it up until you catch yourself dozing off in 1 second, and can stop your head from falling onto your chin before it gets past the halfway point.\n\nHold it there, and the second attention ought to be visible. At first as fast dreams you barely recall, lasting no more than 2 seconds.\n\nBut later as a glow, or a sense of \"depth\", even though your eyes are closed.\n\nThat's the \"second attention\". By learning to sustain that view of it until you can manifest objects in your vision, you will discover what \"energy\" really is.\n\nIf you have energy, you can say, \"Donut!\", and return to silence. And there in front of you, clear as the real thing, will be a floating donut.\n\nJust be careful with that. Don't start requesting things you should not be obsessing over. Because you'll get them!\n\nIf you have more energy, you can do that longer. When the energy runs out, you'll get distracted, have a tiny headache that makes you want to stop, or any other number of things that makes you quit.\n\nYou will find, it's not like anything else. If you want to learn to juggle, then each time you juggle you get a tiny bit better.\n\nOr if you lift weights, each week you can increase the size of the weight a tiny bit.\n\nBut that is NOT true of sorcery. A success one day, almost insures you used up your energy the next.\n\nIf you have a bunch of energy you'll see the room with your eyes closed, and be able to stand up and walk right into a dream. Or you can remote view your chosen location flying along above the ground, looking down. You'll even get a visit from an inorganic being, if you get serious about this technique.\n\n\"Chair Silence\" is the second fastest path to sorcery knowledge, with the fastest being gazing.\n\nBut still, the understanding of energy you get by this method will be unclear.\n\nYou could almost confuse this understanding, gotten by \"chair silence\", with \"power\".\n\nPower is not the same as energy, but that's another topic. Power is your ability to direct intent. But intent is a side effect of awareness flowing along the emanations. So power is more like a side effect of energy, and not energy itself.\n\ncontinued...\n\nBut first, look at this nighmare of Mantak's book deal mind:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hgbso06lkgc71.png?width=1062&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=579ae6c9b631d742528ddb9ae2d9875fc5c9fa6f", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "You guys don't need it, but...", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"am0o5eumffc71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 162, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/am0o5eumffc71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1ff6d5d89f35ccbfda65fcac6af93017368e327"}, {"y": 324, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/am0o5eumffc71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b38eb36207a86963f748faa3b036d57ca25eb06d"}, {"y": 480, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/am0o5eumffc71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ed87597cbdd73ad178487f9ef5fb69ce36d73b3"}, {"y": 961, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/am0o5eumffc71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5c4eaf00762055a2a6b533ecb5d5a8f16570e04"}, {"y": 1442, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/am0o5eumffc71.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a5e8e7c5fd354f1b71e69041d950e43a1802223"}, {"y": 1622, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/am0o5eumffc71.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be99e78bf90eb8b90def3971d0388148a18b441f"}], "s": {"y": 2048, "x": 1363, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/am0o5eumffc71.png?width=1363&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a717937b2df715552a63b9a6aaf7b9ef560be2c7"}, "id": "am0o5eumffc71"}, "hgbso06lkgc71": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 81, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hgbso06lkgc71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=347217bb3df14e72691fffb393734d48d4624d37"}, {"y": 163, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hgbso06lkgc71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a513816b1532fe3e9095b186ebbe68748b110e7"}, {"y": 242, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hgbso06lkgc71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d93ae5e3eba9f9fea15589ea01e052c4509f4c37"}, {"y": 484, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hgbso06lkgc71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5493480b1d525e31e7bf5d1ce3ba03126bd68b1f"}, {"y": 726, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hgbso06lkgc71.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c4da178f30afd6368fba1b1d9e540218f95157e"}], "s": {"y": 804, "x": 1062, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hgbso06lkgc71.png?width=1062&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=579ae6c9b631d742528ddb9ae2d9875fc5c9fa6f"}, "id": "hgbso06lkgc71"}}, "name": "t3_ooabig", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/XGQe674ISN0VeyGazcNP3x9Cx1s5DC7P1O3HewlRRXk.jpg", "edited": 1626826428.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1626812721.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/am0o5eumffc71.png?width=1363&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a717937b2df715552a63b9a6aaf7b9ef560be2c7\"&gt;Is there no end to it???&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From Facebook, where the swamp is still festering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*******&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you see above is mostly pretending, not energy.It&amp;#39;s common.

And there in front of you, clear as the real thing, will be a floating donut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just be careful with that. Don&amp;#39;t start requesting things you should not be obsessing over. Because you&amp;#39;ll get them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have more energy, you can do that longer. When the energy runs out, you&amp;#39;ll get distracted, have a tiny headache that makes you want to stop, or any other number of things that makes you quit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will find, it&amp;#39;s not like anything else. If you want to learn to juggle, then each time you juggle you get a tiny bit better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or if you lift weights, each week you can increase the size of the weight a tiny bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that is NOT true of sorcery. A success one day, almost insures you used up your energy the next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a bunch of energy you&amp;#39;ll see the room with your eyes closed, and be able to stand up and walk right into a dream. Or you can remote view your chosen location flying along above the ground, looking down. You&amp;#39;ll even get a visit from an inorganic being, if you get serious about this technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Chair Silence&amp;quot; is the second fastest path to sorcery knowledge, with the fastest being gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still, the understanding of energy you get by this method will be unclear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could almost confuse this understanding, gotten by &amp;quot;chair silence&amp;quot;, with &amp;quot;power&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Power is not the same as energy, but that&amp;#39;s another topic. Power is your ability to direct intent. But intent is a side effect of awareness flowing along the emanations. So power is more like a side effect of energy, and not energy itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;continued...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But first, look at this nighmare of Mantak&amp;#39;s book deal mind:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hgbso06lkgc71.png?width=1062&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=579ae6c9b631d742528ddb9ae2d9875fc5c9fa6f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/hgbso06lkgc71.png?width=1062&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=579ae6c9b631d742528ddb9ae2d9875fc5c9fa6f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d6fc83ea-6085-11ea-8e55-0e4b8f0764ef", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "ooabig", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 43, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ooabig/you_guys_dont_need_it_but/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ooabig/you_guys_dont_need_it_but/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1626812721.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h60qdjv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h5zn4af", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;Can the wall show up at the start of the red zone?\n\nYes, but oddly it's reddish!\n\nNo kidding!\n\nI saw it last night.

So I don't need to tell you what to do next, in order to learn about energy by this method.\r  \nThe dreaming awake this produces will taunt you with your lack of enough energy to do what you want.\r  \nBut there's an even more reliable way to learn what energy is.\r  \nYou keep up the playing with puffs of color, and do tensegrity moves which become visible, always trying to build up your energy body until it becomes visible.\r  \nWhen you can glance down and see that your torso is glowing in yellowish light, and that there are faint fibers radiating out from your stomach, you are almost there.\r  \nOf course, it takes a lot of energy to get this far. But try to conserve it by not indulging too much, in playing with the visible magic you have discovered.\r  \nIf you keep it up, the puffs of brilliant colors (often purple) will begin to bleach out. They'll change to thin clouds of whitish light and the brilliant colors will fade away.\r  \nThis means your assemblage point had reached the bottom. The \"Shift Below\". And it's now coming up the front.\r  \nOnly sorcerers can do this. Buddhists, Daoists, and Yogis, never get off the bottom, except by accident.\r  \nThe \"Men of Knowledge\" also never got off the bottom. They had no reason to! Intense magic is in the domain of the shift below.\r  \nPower plant abusers such as \"shroom heads\" or people who believe they can learn sorcery with LSD, also never make it off the bottom.\r  \nYou have to have sobriety, clarity, and energy to make up up from the intense magic of the red zone.\r  \nAs it comes up the front the visible magic fades away and the faint white puffs lay themselves flat on any surface in the dark room.\r  \nThe entire room becomes \"visible\" with dull whitish light.\r  \nYou'll be so surprised, you'll go check to see if your dark room has sprung a leak. You'll be sure that's real light you are seeing, and have to check it out.\r  \nBut it hasn't. That's the famous \"energy\" everyone wants to \"see\".\r  \nSit up on the bed, don't walk around anymore, and use your peripheral vision to watch the whitish light.\r  \nIt will form into a phantom copy of your bedroom.

Second Ring of Power (second attention). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan apparently even disliked inventing another term for an &amp;quot;ultimately enlightened seer,&amp;quot; and just recycled Man of Knowledge instead, and made it context-dependant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything comes round again, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what do we know that handily aids in freeing up our attention? Recapitulation. Going over past stuff until you don&amp;#39;t dwell (focus) on it at the expense of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder about the role of our first attention reserves though. Does the level of complication of the inventories &amp;amp; actions we engage with in the daily waking world determine how much of our reserve attention we have to work with in the second ring?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: could be another reason why Carlos got that job later on as a short order cook in a diner, making eggs&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null,

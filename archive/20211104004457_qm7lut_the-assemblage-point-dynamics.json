He ended up telling us nearly no details.  \n\nFor a reason I now understand.\n\nThis new woman in chat wanted an example of what could be too advanced to talk about.\n\nI explained how there was, for example, a door in my south east corner, and if you walked in there a teacher was available.\n\nI didn't want to say a giant root grew from the floor and busted open the ceiling, stretching 50 feet above my room.\n\nTMI.\n\nSo I simply said there was a door there.\n\nI didn't even remember that conversation tonight when I got to the orange zone. I have so many these days.\n\nBut once I did, I used my palm sweep across the walls technique.\n\nTo try to invigorate the whitish light.\n\nAnd there, where the giant root/tree trunk had been, was a perfect door.\n\nIt had the color of the root, but it was faded to grey on the edges.  Like the primer paint  had worn though due to the incredible age of that door. \n\nIt was obviously a sturdy sheet metal door like an old business worried about break ins might have.\n\nIt was absolutely stable and real.  \n\nIt came because I had added a new \"story\" in private chat.\n\nA story is deeper than knowledge.

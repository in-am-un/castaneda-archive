However, I will just tell it bluntly as it is.\n\nIt was 2017, and I had been dealing with some difficult issues that had left me depressed. By this time, I was feeling better because the issues were resolving, but a lingering depression remained even after the tough times had passed.\n\nI had this idea that I wanted to take a trip to Virginia, specifically to see the Blue Ridge mountains and take a break from my usual surroundings. I also had some friends living there, so I wanted to catch up with them.\n\nA buddy of mine lived in a wooded area south of Roanoke. He had a guest house where I could stay for a couple of days. We had fun reminiscing, playing video games, and having a few drinks. You know just the usual stuff.\n\nThe cool thing about his location was that it was quite secluded, and especially lush and beautiful in the late spring when I was there. During my stay, I took some hikes through the woods, simply choosing a direction and following where I felt drawn. I only hiked during the day.\n\nNow, I'm going to start describing the experience, and I must say, there are many aspects that are hard to describe. I am doing my best to put into words something that was utterly alien and bizarre.\n\nOn the second day at my buddy's house, I decided to take another walk through the woods, just as I had done before. It was a serene, almost meditative experience, allowing me to let go of my thoughts and focus on my surroundings.\n\nAt one point during my walk, I had an intense sensation of crossing some kind of boundary. It was like waking up from a dream, though I was clearly not asleep. I wasn\u2019t really paying attention to anything specific, but after this shift, I felt almost jolted and looked around. Nothing was the same. The trees were still trees, but they looked different. The first thing I noticed was the branches, covered in fuzzy black things that moved like \u201celectrical\u201d or energy wisps. For whatever reason, I sensed these were creatures, not inanimate objects.\n\nThen I started noticing the sounds. There was a distant, deep, vibrating noise that undulated back and forth. It wasn\u2019t musical, but it constantly changed, somewhat like a person talking, though it wasn\u2019t speech at all. That's the best way I can explain it.\n\nSo there I was, focused on these creatures zooming around a tree branch, hearing this noise. I didn\u2019t feel like I was unable to move, but for some reason, I didn\u2019t move. It was extremely weird because I had no idea when I had stopped walking. I was walking, and then suddenly, I was standing still, observing and experiencing these phenomena. Then, for the first time, I shifted my gaze to what was in front of me, and I saw what looked like a geometric pattern in the woods. It was like those fractal patterns, except the forest and everything around me looked like a pattern, yet everything remained distinct at the same time.\n\nAs this was happening, I felt several things: it had become much colder, like standing in front of an open fridge, yet there was no wind. However, I felt a warmth coming from behind me, like the sun or a large heat lamp shining on my back. I could also see this light coming around into the corners of my eyes. Then, an idea popped into my mind that I wasn\u2019t seeing the real world, but rather looking at a giant screen. As soon as I had that thought, everything returned to normal instantly.\n\nAfter this experience, to say that I was freaked out would be an understatement. However, I have some skills in maintaining self-control under pressure, so I decided to walk back to the house as calmly as I could. I tried to convince myself that I was having a vivid daydream, recalling how I used to run around and imagine things in my childhood. After some time and distance from the event, I\u2019ve become less reliant on self-defense mechanisms like lying to myself. I know whatever that was, it wasn\u2019t just a daydream.

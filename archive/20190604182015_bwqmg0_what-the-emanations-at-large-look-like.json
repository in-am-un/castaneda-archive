I suspect that damaged things a bit, although it still could have been a wise strategy for Carlos.\n\nYes, seeing can be feeling. And I suspect it's superior that way.  I'm on the border of abandoning rationality during my practices, and I can see that trying to make things visual is a form of \"corrective rationality\".  \n\nHoward Lee was the only one around Carlos who could actually move other people's assemblage points, unless you count Carol's stage magic tricks (which worked extremely well in some cases). And Howard only \u201cfeels\u201d energy.   Yet, he pushed my assemblage point so that I could have a visual image of the particular \u201cGreat Band of Emanations\u201d he\u2019d zeroed in on, to create his technique \n\nYou can perceive that as a glow, when you do his technique.  Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s able to move people\u2019s assemblage points, seeing as how don Juan said the Nagual\u2019s blow is more like a glow that dents another glow.\n\nBut myself, I'd rather have seeing be visual so I can have a fairy standing on my bed.  \n\nLast night was interesting. I'd finally figured out that it's not good to force the allies into a specific shape.  That's like having Einstein around while you're doing high school math homework, and insisting he has dress up like the mad scientist with crazy hair from one of his classic photos.\n\nLast night, I had enough self-control not to insist. I'm still trying to figure out how to move people's assemblage points, so I got myself to the waiting room for stopping the world.  It's a place you can stand, with walls around you about 12 feet away, made out of energy.  There are all kinds of odd details on the walls, but it\u2019s best not to stare at them unless you want to leave the room.\n\nI wasn\u2019t after that.  I just wanted the flat surface so I could practice my second attention dodge ball.\n\nI looked to the left, to see if the bank of fog was there.  Nope.  There's still something out of sorts with my technique.  But it didn't matter.  I just wanted the glowing flat surface so that I could judge whether I had dented it.\n\nI had an odd thought.  If that\u2019s the inside of my luminous cocoon as I suspect, what happens if I dent it myself?  Doesn\u2019t sound good. \n\nBut then, I\u2019m not afraid of doing tensegrity barefoot in the woods, because it would be kind of cool if something made out of the second attention creeped up my leg from the ground.  If you never burn your hand, you\u2019ll never develop the lightening reflexes we all have, for pulling our hand back from something hot.\n\nI formed up a ball of purple energy, but it was really hard to do. I'd had the problem Carlos told us about, in the Active Side of Infinity.   It\u2019s worth quoting, but that book isn\u2019t in my searchable pdf.\n\nI\u2019ll point out again, Active Side of Infinity was anything but nostalgic.  There\u2019s been that accusation out there.  It was in fact, Carlos\u2019 parting instructions. His \u201chow to\u201d book, with all the distractions removed.  It\u2019s easy to get confused by his early books, since they were essentially performance art by don Juan\u2019s group.  It\u2019s hard to separate the performance from the technique.  \n\nCarlos did that in Active Side of Infinity.  In the story he\u2019s there with don Juan\u2019s party who are about to do something transcendental, and his assemblage point keeps moving back to its original crummy spot. Don Juan has to keep reminding him, \u201cUp from your toes!!!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019ll happen to you.  At first, you\u2019ll finally manage to get up the will to practice. It\u2019ll be hard to find the time, and you\u2019ll be doubting if it\u2019s worth it.  But if you keep it up, you\u2019ll realize it works.\n\nNow the second battle.  You have to realize, this is serious.  You have to do it every day if you want to make rapid progress.  If you do it once a week, it\u2019ll take decades to get anywhere.  \n\nIt\u2019s not that doing it twice produces twice as many results.  You\u2019re trying to slowly move the assemblage point closer to heightened awareness, permanently.  I suspect it\u2019s more like drug doses.  People know that with pain medications, twice as much at the same time produces an effect more like 4 times as strong.   Same for explosives. Twice as much explosive produces far more of a bang than you\u2019d expect.\n\nThe problem is, we\u2019ve been trained to be \u201ccookie hunters\u201d.  \n\nI saw some cookie hunters in the grocery store yesterday.  I was practicing very deep silence to get super hearing in the store, and picked up a commotion on the other end. It was children, excited about something they\u2019d found on the shelves.\n\nI walked over to find a group of 3 very young boys. The youngest could barely talk, but he was good at walking.  The older 2 couldn\u2019t have been more than 1 year apart.  The oldest was poking a box of prize cookies. They had layers of red jelly, white cream, and they\u2019d been died a lovely brown color, to give them that toasted look.  He was saying something about which parts he\u2019d eat first.  \n\nHis slightly younger brother jumped up and down in anticipation.  Then he decided he didn\u2019t want to be outdone, so he started poking every single cookie box that was different.  He said, \u201cI\u2019d eat all of this, and all of this, and all of this!!!\u201d\n\nHe was interrupted by the youngest who gave out a grunt of disapproval. He was too young to participate effectively.  But the older brothers knew the drill. They moved to the sides so that he could walk right up to the shelf, and have his say. He mumbled something about a particular box, noticed the older brothers had moved on, and sighed with a little relief. At least he\u2019d gotten his 2 cents in this time.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been trained to be cookie hunters by our moms.  It\u2019s pretty much the current condition of mankind, unless you consider scientists and athletes who participate in at least a little exploring.\n\nWe were born as navigators, so that we could explore and learn and grow.  But our moms wanted us to solve their problems, so they turned us into cookie hunters.\n\nThe problem they were trying to solve, is their slow realization that they\u2019d been promised much more than that path in life actually delivers.  The only way they can make up for that is by finding companionship.\n\nI looked down the isle to see what kind of Mom they had, but it turned out to be the Dad who had brought them. He was looking sadly at the walls of treats in that isle, his head bent down with a frown. There was something heavy on his mind.  \n\nI could only speculate on what it was, but one thing was obvious. His own cookie hunting had not worked out for him.  All he seemed to have left was to try to enjoy the next generation\u2019s cookie hunting, and to pay at the cash register with a smile, to acknowledge the wisdom of cookie hunting.\n\nI suspect his own predilection now was beer hunting.  Or worse.\n\nMy cookie hunter spirit came to me last night, and I didn\u2019t want to get up to practice.  I felt like there couldn\u2019t be any real reward in trying to toss imaginary balls at an imaginary wall.  I thought of people I know making fun of the idea, comparing it to mental illness.  Obviously if you give up cookie hunting, there\u2019s something seriously wrong with you.\n\nBut I\u2019d been through that struggle before, and knew how to beat it.  I got up, guzzled a can of Espresso double shot to satisfy my cookie hunter\u2019s spirit, forced myself silent, did a little tensegrity, and started to see the colors. \n\nWhen my Fairy first peeked out of a ball of purple light, I couldn\u2019t even remember that old position of the assemblage point. The place of pity was gone for a while.\n\nBut I had trouble making a strong enough glowing ball.  Unless it\u2019s very bright, it fizzles out when you throw  it.  \n\nI tried all the tricks I know.  Fluffing it, rubbing it on my leg and scooping it back up, stretching it, and pouring it over my head.\n\nMy fairy kept making floating head appearances, then finally got right into the middle of the purple blob and opened her mouth wide, puckering her lips even with that wide gap.\n\nIt was kind of horrific, I had to admit.  But I realized, could she be blowing?\n\nMy Allies don\u2019t normally animate if seen while awake.  You just \u201crealize\u201d they\u2019re making a new face.  If you stare at it, it morphs into another, and another.  On the very rare occasions where they animate, it\u2019s like a Spielberg moment, where I get a tingle up my spine.   It\u2019s just a little too real at that point.\n\nI realized, my fairy was right. I\u2019d forgotten about that technique. I blew into it, and it did indeed get a little brighter.  She opened her mouth even wider, tilted her head, and I got the impression I needed to blow a lot harder than that.\n\nI started inhaling deeply and exhaling with the strongest blast I could muster, but without actually making enough wind to blow it away.  The key was in fact to open the mouth very wide, to avoid making a beam of air.  It was more like exhaling hard to show someone how bad your breath is today.  You don\u2019t want to blow on their nose.  You just want to put out the maximum amount of air, without disturbing anything.\n\nThe purple ball turned orange, got a lot brighter, and I realized,  I\u2019m just hyperventilating here!  \n\nI decided that was enough of that,  pulled my hand back with the glowing ball on it,  the Fairy seemed to be all for it, and I tossed the ball at the wall with the Fairy riding on top. \n\nIt smashed against the wall, spread out like powder, and the wall was unfazed.  It was flat as ever. Not even the details of wavy vertical lines had been altered.   \n\nThe Fairy was still there, where the ball had hit and turned into dust.  She had a sad look on her face. It was the same one Tinkerbell gave Peter when he failed to fly the first time.\n\nEdited for errors", "edited": 1559843250.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_eq78a98", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please bring anything you have, as long as you&amp;#39;re sincere.

I suspect that damaged things a bit, although it still could have been a wise strategy for Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, seeing can be feeling. And I suspect it&amp;#39;s superior that way.  I&amp;#39;m on the border of abandoning rationality during my practices, and I can see that trying to make things visual is a form of &amp;quot;corrective rationality&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Howard Lee was the only one around Carlos who could actually move other people&amp;#39;s assemblage points, unless you count Carol&amp;#39;s stage magic tricks (which worked extremely well in some cases). And Howard only \u201cfeels\u201d energy.   Yet, he pushed my assemblage point so that I could have a visual image of the particular \u201cGreat Band of Emanations\u201d he\u2019d zeroed in on, to create his technique &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can perceive that as a glow, when you do his technique.  Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s able to move people\u2019s assemblage points, seeing as how don Juan said the Nagual\u2019s blow is more like a glow that dents another glow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But myself, I&amp;#39;d rather have seeing be visual so I can have a fairy standing on my bed.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night was interesting. I&amp;#39;d finally figured out that it&amp;#39;s not good to force the allies into a specific shape.  That&amp;#39;s like having Einstein around while you&amp;#39;re doing high school math homework, and insisting he has dress up like the mad scientist with crazy hair from one of his classic photos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last night, I had enough self-control not to insist. I&amp;#39;m still trying to figure out how to move people&amp;#39;s assemblage points, so I got myself to the waiting room for stopping the world.  It&amp;#39;s a place you can stand, with walls around you about 12 feet away, made out of energy.  There are all kinds of odd details on the walls, but it\u2019s best not to stare at them unless you want to leave the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn\u2019t after that.  I just wanted the flat surface so I could practice my second attention dodge ball.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked to the left, to see if the bank of fog was there.  Nope.  There&amp;#39;s still something out of sorts with my technique.  But it didn&amp;#39;t matter.  I just wanted the glowing flat surface so that I could judge whether I had dented it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had an odd thought.  If that\u2019s the inside of my luminous cocoon as I suspect, what happens if I dent it myself?  Doesn\u2019t sound good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then, I\u2019m not afraid of doing tensegrity barefoot in the woods, because it would be kind of cool if something made out of the second attention creeped up my leg from the ground.  If you never burn your hand, you\u2019ll never develop the lightening reflexes we all have, for pulling our hand back from something hot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I formed up a ball of purple energy, but it was really hard to do. I&amp;#39;d had the problem Carlos told us about, in the Active Side of Infinity.   It\u2019s worth quoting, but that book isn\u2019t in my searchable pdf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll point out again, Active Side of Infinity was anything but nostalgic.  There\u2019s been that accusation out there.  It was in fact, Carlos\u2019 parting instructions. His \u201chow to\u201d book, with all the distractions removed.  It\u2019s easy to get confused by his early books, since they were essentially performance art by don Juan\u2019s group.  It\u2019s hard to separate the performance from the technique.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos did that in Active Side of Infinity.  In the story he\u2019s there with don Juan\u2019s party who are about to do something transcendental, and his assemblage point keeps moving back to its original crummy spot. Don Juan has to keep reminding him, \u201cUp from your toes!!!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019ll happen to you.  At first, you\u2019ll finally manage to get up the will to practice.

But then, this topic wouldn't have been complete without it.\n\nWhat you imply is true also.  In order to make things easier for us, our second attention comes up with a view we can learn to manipulate.  It's spawned by the second attention's assemblage point, the same way our first attention has one.  Possibly all of reality is like that.   Likely, even the Tonal's generated images.\n\nIn the case of this image of the emanations, I'd seen that movie.  That doesn't mean I had that anywhere in my mind when I saw the emanations.  And while I was seeing them, I was too innocent (silent) to realize it.  But it's certainly possible that image from the Matrix had an influence.\n\nThe same could be said for \"The Eagle\".  To paraphrase Carlos' writings, it has nothing to do with an Eagle, and the sight of one is probably because one of the early seers described his vision, and that had a \"sticky\" effect on the entire lineage.  I suggest he should have picked my favorite: a giant Fairy.  At least it wouldn't have been so frightening, and there would be something pleasant to look at while it ate you.  We could even re-describe it eating us, as hugging us to death.\n\n\"The wall\" is a good example of something which can be seen according to the user's preference. Possibly that's because it's fairly easy to see, so we don't have to resort to an obscure description.\n\nIt's a manifestation of the second attention in a useful form, for utilization by the first attention.  It's a control console for the second attention.  But what should that look like?\n\nIf I'd thought of it, I might have ended up seeing it as the Star Trek navigation console.  Carlos could have encouraged it, by describing that for us.\n\nI've seen it as a real wall with a cheesy 70s nautical wall covering. Not once, but for weeks anytime I closed my eyes.  If I watched the other side, I was seeing energy in whatever was there.\n\nI've also seen it the way Carlos wanted us to see it, as a wall of vague and not so vague colors and lines, with an intense purple patch containing a white and black swirl. The swirl spawns or spins off text you can read.  Carlos gave at least one lecture just reading from that.  He even got one of the women to paint it that way, so he could print copies and distribute them.\n\nAlthough that's a supreme accomplishment (reading continuously from the wall), I can at least verify that you can read entire sentences spawned by it.  I can't imagine being able to read continuously like he would have had to do to give a lecture that way.  His mind would have to be exceptionally silent, and even harder, in the midst of a group of self-pity loving apprentices.\n\nBy the way, I should pass on something.  When Carlos was reading off the wall, his eyes focused slightly to his left, and off into infinity.  You could see that they weren't looking at anything in the room.  They were sort of blank.  He'd stare like that, say a few sentences, then return to us and look at our faces, and comment on it.  So I guess, he didn't give the entire lecture just reading what was written there. He also commented on it.\n\nI've seen the wall as a virtual computer screen, covered in aps you can activate.  That includes multiple animated dreaming windows, including one I was able to dive into, and remain there for hours, fully lucid the whole time.\n\nAll of these descriptions are while awake, with my eyes open. I just want to make that point, because there's a tendency for people to take ordinary dream images which have some sorcery theme, describe it to people, and not point out that their experience was pretty much an ordinary dream.  Carlos caught some students doing that in class, and nipped it in the bud by embarrassing them over it. That's how we learn, unfortunately.   I've heard famous yogis describe a vision they had, with all their students gasping over some bizarre imagery.  What the yogi probably neglected to mention was, he just ate too much rice and almonds and had a nightmare.  Carlos implied the liver was the source of such nightmares.  Could be he had more experience in that area than we realize, due to his illness.\n\nI've also seen \"The Wall\" as an object of focus for an Ally, who floated just above it to help me maintain my attention on the wall as a real thing.  It\u2019s pretty hard to sustain \u201cThe Wall\u201d at first, but super simple if there\u2019s a visible being floating above it, looking down to emphasize that vision.  If you see such a sight, look off into the distance to the right and above the Ally, to see if you can spot its true form.  The being is just a projection.  I'm not sure who projects it.\n\nI've also seen the wall surround me, and start to generate details of other worlds. It becomes a place to stand between worlds.  It's the waiting room for \"Stopping the World\", in one way of looking at it.\n\nAnd I've seen it as a practice surface at which I can toss glowing balls, to see how it dents. I'm trying to duplicate don Juan's \"glow which makes a dent in another glow\" theory of how to move the assemblage point.  Hopefully absent a Nagual.\n\nOne thing I plan to see soon, is \"The Wall\" as an orb for s\u00e9ances.  We all know that technique, if we've read the witches books.

But then, this topic wouldn&amp;#39;t have been complete without it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you imply is true also.  In order to make things easier for us, our second attention comes up with a view we can learn to manipulate.  It&amp;#39;s spawned by the second attention&amp;#39;s assemblage point, the same way our first attention has one.  Possibly all of reality is like that.   Likely, even the Tonal&amp;#39;s generated images.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of this image of the emanations, I&amp;#39;d seen that movie.  That doesn&amp;#39;t mean I had that anywhere in my mind when I saw the emanations.  And while I was seeing them, I was too innocent (silent) to realize it.  But it&amp;#39;s certainly possible that image from the Matrix had an influence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same could be said for &amp;quot;The Eagle&amp;quot;.  To paraphrase Carlos&amp;#39; writings, it has nothing to do with an Eagle, and the sight of one is probably because one of the early seers described his vision, and that had a &amp;quot;sticky&amp;quot; effect on the entire lineage.  I suggest he should have picked my favorite: a giant Fairy.  At least it wouldn&amp;#39;t have been so frightening, and there would be something pleasant to look at while it ate you.  We could even re-describe it eating us, as hugging us to death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The wall&amp;quot; is a good example of something which can be seen according to the user&amp;#39;s preference. Possibly that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s fairly easy to see, so we don&amp;#39;t have to resort to an obscure description.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a manifestation of the second attention in a useful form, for utilization by the first attention.  It&amp;#39;s a control console for the second attention.  But what should that look like?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;d thought of it, I might have ended up seeing it as the Star Trek navigation console.  Carlos could have encouraged it, by describing that for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen it as a real wall with a cheesy 70s nautical wall covering. Not once, but for weeks anytime I closed my eyes.  If I watched the other side, I was seeing energy in whatever was there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also seen it the way Carlos wanted us to see it, as a wall of vague and not so vague colors and lines, with an intense purple patch containing a white and black swirl. The swirl spawns or spins off text you can read.  Carlos gave at least one lecture just reading from that.  He even got one of the women to paint it that way, so he could print copies and distribute them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although that&amp;#39;s a supreme accomplishment (reading continuously from the wall), I can at least verify that you can read entire sentences spawned by it.  I can&amp;#39;t imagine being able to read continuously like he would have had to do to give a lecture that way.  His mind would have to be exceptionally silent, and even harder, in the midst of a group of self-pity loving apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, I should pass on something.  When Carlos was reading off the wall, his eyes focused slightly to his left, and off into infinity.  You could see that they weren&amp;#39;t looking at anything in the room.  They were sort of blank.  He&amp;#39;d stare like that, say a few sentences, then return to us and look at our faces, and comment on it.  So I guess, he didn&amp;#39;t give the entire lecture just reading what was written there. He also commented on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen the wall as a virtual computer screen, covered in aps you can activate.  That includes multiple animated dreaming windows, including one I was able to dive into, and remain there for hours, fully lucid the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of these descriptions are while awake, with my eyes open. I just want to make that point, because there&amp;#39;s a tendency for people to take ordinary dream images which have some sorcery theme, describe it to people, and not point out that their experience was pretty much an ordinary dream.  Carlos caught some students doing that in class, and nipped it in the bud by embarrassing them over it. That&amp;#39;s how we learn, unfortunately.   I&amp;#39;ve heard famous yogis describe a vision they had, with all their students gasping over some bizarre imagery.  What the yogi probably neglected to mention was, he just ate too much rice and almonds and had a nightmare.  Carlos implied the liver was the source of such nightmares.  Could be he had more experience in that area than we realize, due to his illness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also seen &amp;quot;The Wall&amp;quot; as an object of focus for an Ally, who floated just above it to help me maintain my attention on the wall as a real thing.  It\u2019s pretty hard to sustain \u201cThe Wall\u201d at first, but super simple if there\u2019s a visible being floating above it, looking down to emphasize that vision.  If you see such a sight, look off into the distance to the right and above the Ally, to see if you can spot its true form.  The being is just a projection.  I&amp;#39;m not sure who projects it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also seen the wall surround me, and start to generate details of other worlds. It becomes a place to stand between worlds.  It&amp;#39;s the waiting room for &amp;quot;Stopping the World&amp;quot;, in one way of looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;ve seen it as a practice surface at which I can toss glowing balls, to see how it dents. I&amp;#39;m trying to duplicate don Juan&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;glow which makes a dent in another glow&amp;quot; theory of how to move the assemblage point.  Hopefully absent a Nagual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I plan to see soon, is &amp;quot;The Wall&amp;quot; as an orb for s\u00e9ances.  We all know that technique, if we&amp;#39;ve read the witches books.  The coolest part of that technique is that multiple people focus their attention into forming the portal, and they have a lot of nicotene to prevent falling into ordinary sleep.  I suggest it&amp;#39;s the best technique to start with, for group dreaming.  Plus you get to smoke cigars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keeping all that in mind, I guess it&amp;#39;s possible for the emanations to look like a field of very tall grass, with seed pods spaced along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or a black widow spider web that stretches into infinity, with randomly placed egg sacks, each one a world you can dive into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Myself, I have a tendency to get caught up in appearances.

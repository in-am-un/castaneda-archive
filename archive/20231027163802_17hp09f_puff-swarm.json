I couldn't resist!\n\nI'll go see if it's possible to buy a real starry sky animation background, complete with twinkling stars like you'd see at night in the desert.\n\nThis video shows a DEEP red zone effect which indicates your energy body is starting to LIKE clinging to your torso.\n\nIt's a side effect of the tensegrity, which lures the double to come out into our copy of reality. But also, Tensegrity \"redeploys\" its energy from off the walls of the luminous egg.\n\nWhere all of our awareness is trapped.\n\nInside the egg!\n\nAnd yet, there's the illusion of space.\n\nSo we can perceive our energy body as puffs, which is what Tensegrity manipulates much of the time.\n\nThat \"puff swarm\" eventually forms your \"blue ball of energy\" body, which the new seers preferred.\n\nOver what, the books never said. But you can imagine the types of energy bodies the old seers might come up with!\n\nOr better yet, go back in time and see for yourself! We can do that.\n\nKeep in mind, once the energy body forms you can FEEL it. Or feel with it.\n\nIt has all of the senses, so that as you move it around connected to your physical body, you can \"feel\" the second attention.\n\nWhich creates ripples in reality, the cracks in which allow you passage to other realms.\n\nSometimes...\n\nAnd not as often as you'd like.\n\nNever fall victim to the \"superman effect\" where you believe that real magic ought to be like pretend magic from books and religions.\n\nWe don't get to control the amazing sights we see, as often as we'd like.\n\nIt's more like a series of \"gifts\" from infinity, to show us all of what the new seers had discovered.\n\nThen it's up to us to learn to do these on demand.\n\nBy cleaning our link to intent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4hwg6wh3brwb1.jpg?width=2160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a773a1fa315c9e74d8d3b99b4bad3192e1971bd", "user_reports": [], "saved": false,

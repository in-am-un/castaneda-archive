Who the hell has she been hanging out with?\n\nWas she watching NCIS reruns again?  She's always admired Abby.\n\nWhatever you do, DON'T let her watch Magnum PI re-runs.\n\nOk, musings on the red zone.  Not proven, but that picture is cool.  So it needs some \"techniques\".\n\nFirst, a \"rule of darkroom\".  Maybe #7.  We'll invent the other 6 rules later.\n\nRule #7: Everything you perceive in darkroom is available at all levels of the J curve.\n\n**Everything**. It just chances in nature, given a specific location.\n\nIn this explanation, it's a GIVEN you are free from internal dialogue, but not free from visual fantasies in the mind.\n\nYou have absolutely no internal dialogue, so that your assemblage point is free to move anywhere.\n\nBUT, you are still engaged in \"self-reflection\".  What does that mean?\n\nYou still visualize yourself as a person, interacting with the world.  And you can call up images of what you are thinking about, even if there are no words.\n\nWhich means, you are directing your awareness.  But, the assemblage point is free to move. It's not stuck in the loop produced by the internal dialogue.\n\nIt's the IDEAL state to be in, to gain insight into dark room and how it works.\n\nNot ideal for getting to the orange zone however.  It all has to go for that.\n\nBut in this experimental state, if you are at the green line, that's where the darkness starts to take on a magical quality.    Stuff is rather vague, but you can still detect it as feelings or impressions.\n\nAt the green line it's still very easy to spot something up at the blue line, and get pulled the wrong way.\n\nEvery puff, every smear, every whitish light on surfaces, exists at all levels.\n\nIt looks different, but it can be \"noticed\".\n\nAnd all sensations and feelings that are not visual, but still reflect the J curve experience.\n\nWhatever you notice pulls you to where it's stronger in the form you notice.\n\nBecause when you \"notice it\", you are using that self-reflection ability to visualize images.\n\nYou will be urged to \"focus the image\" that you see in the distance. Which means, moving up closer.\n\nAt all levels going down, you can accidentally perceive something from a higher level, and lose your gain. Red zone can see green zone.\n\nBut at the BOTTOM of the J curve, you can't move up.  Because we are moving along the outside, not in depth as the Nagual's blow makes it move.  And on the bottom, the only direction along the outside, is back where you came from, or forward to the front.\n\nIf you are in the very middle of the bottom of the J, you can only go back or forward.  And either direction is magical.\n\nIt's playland!!!!\n\nFrom the middle, going back means vivid super exciting magic!  Your IOB will be fully real looking over there.  At every inch your body shapeshifts in small ways you don't notice.  But they all make you better able to function at that position.\n\nSo if you accidentally move back, it's still all good for a whole foot more of travel on the J curve.\n\nIf you move forward, you are heading for the place of no pity.\n\nThe orange zone.  Bliss.  All knowledge.\n\nBut oddly, it's not as much fun as the bottom.\n\nJuan mentioned that only in the orange does suffering go away.\n\nBut excitement and astonishment also go away.\n\nSo, let's say you're the Nagual Julian.\n\nOr a \"Man of Knowledge\".\n\nYou play around at the bottom, because it's the most super cool.\n\nI suppose the Men of Knowledge were even selling 1 evening vacations in the red zone.\n\nLike going to the peyote fields near Mexico City. There's always a \"guide\" with you, who wants you to have the most exciting experience, without getting hurt, or suing anyone.\n\nPeople remember the red zone.\n\nBut they often can't remember the orange zone.  So if you are selling magic, red zone is the place to go.\n\nNow here's the problem with the red zone, according to Lily.\n\nYou create a replacement internal dialogue, if you hang out down there.\n\nThe internal dialogue as we know it, is basically a grumpy person complaining about how awful and unfair the world is.\n\nBut remember rule #7.\n\nIt still exists in the red zone.\n\nIt's just different.\n\nIf you watch VERY carefully, you'll realize you never did actually get rid of the internal dialogue.  You just sort of suppressed it.  Which is good enough to move.\n\nBut at the bottom it's so different you won't suppress it well.\n\nSo let's say you're up at the blue zone, trying to burn with the fire from within. I'm not sure if you weren't 1000 miles above your body before that, having stretched your shell.\n\nBut let's assume you could still light up everything, starting at your normal position.\n\nYou move your assemblage point super fast down to the green, then the red, and finally you are on the bottom, all in 1 second.\n\nBecause you moved so fast, it's all still glowing.\n\nBut you have an internal dialogue down there in the red zone.\n\nYou \"understand\" fine details of what it's like down there.  You have opinions on them.  Memories. Triumphs, defeats.\n\nThat won't stop you from leaving the red zone and heading on to the Orange.\n\nUnless you are a \"Man of Knowledge'. They never learned to keep going.\n\nBut Julian could certainly keep going.\n\nExcept, he encountered a little \"skip\" at the bottom.\n\nA delay.   His \"red zone internal dialogue\" kicked in, and held him back for an instant, the same way it holds all of us back at the top.\n\nTo keep all of the emanations lit up you have to move the entire distance in less than the time it takes the emanations to cool off after being made to glow.\n\nSo too much fun in the red zone, is a problem if you want to learn to reach the 3rd attention.\n\nOn the other hand, supposedly you can just sneak around the Eagle.\n\nSo let's not turn this into a religious judgment on the bottom of the J curve.\n\nWe'll just sum it up in more simple terms.\n\n\"Play with Demons too much and you can't get to heaven in time.\"\n\nMaybe that'll be rule #285.  Like the \"rules of acquisition\" on Star Trek.  There's a lot of those, because the ones at the end of the list are dubious at best.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h2c8tj2", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that Fairy?????

It just chances in nature, given a specific location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this explanation, it&amp;#39;s a GIVEN you are free from internal dialogue, but not free from visual fantasies in the mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have absolutely no internal dialogue, so that your assemblage point is free to move anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, you are still engaged in &amp;quot;self-reflection&amp;quot;.  What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You still visualize yourself as a person, interacting with the world.  And you can call up images of what you are thinking about, even if there are no words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means, you are directing your awareness.  But, the assemblage point is free to move. It&amp;#39;s not stuck in the loop produced by the internal dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the IDEAL state to be in, to gain insight into dark room and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not ideal for getting to the orange zone however.  It all has to go for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in this experimental state, if you are at the green line, that&amp;#39;s where the darkness starts to take on a magical quality.    Stuff is rather vague, but you can still detect it as feelings or impressions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the green line it&amp;#39;s still very easy to spot something up at the blue line, and get pulled the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every puff, every smear, every whitish light on surfaces, exists at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks different, but it can be &amp;quot;noticed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all sensations and feelings that are not visual, but still reflect the J curve experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you notice pulls you to where it&amp;#39;s stronger in the form you notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because when you &amp;quot;notice it&amp;quot;, you are using that self-reflection ability to visualize images.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will be urged to &amp;quot;focus the image&amp;quot; that you see in the distance. Which means, moving up closer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At all levels going down, you can accidentally perceive something from a higher level, and lose your gain. Red zone can see green zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the BOTTOM of the J curve, you can&amp;#39;t move up.  Because we are moving along the outside, not in depth as the Nagual&amp;#39;s blow makes it move.  And on the bottom, the only direction along the outside, is back where you came from, or forward to the front.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are in the very middle of the bottom of the J, you can only go back or forward.  And either direction is magical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s playland!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From the middle, going back means vivid super exciting magic!  Your IOB will be fully real looking over there.  At every inch your body shapeshifts in small ways you don&amp;#39;t notice.  But they all make you better able to function at that position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you accidentally move back, it&amp;#39;s still all good for a whole foot more of travel on the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you move forward, you are heading for the place of no pity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The orange zone.  Bliss.  All knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But oddly, it&amp;#39;s not as much fun as the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan mentioned that only in the orange does suffering go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But excitement and astonishment also go away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re the Nagual Julian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or a &amp;quot;Man of Knowledge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You play around at the bottom, because it&amp;#39;s the most super cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose the Men of Knowledge were even selling 1 evening vacations in the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like going to the peyote fields near Mexico City. There&amp;#39;s always a &amp;quot;guide&amp;quot; with you, who wants you to have the most exciting experience, without getting hurt, or suing anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People remember the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they often can&amp;#39;t remember the orange zone.  So if you are selling magic, red zone is the place to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;#39;s the problem with the red zone, according to Lily.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You create a replacement internal dialogue, if you hang out down there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The internal dialogue as we know it, is basically a grumpy person complaining about how awful and unfair the world is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But remember rule #7.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It still exists in the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you watch VERY carefully, you&amp;#39;ll realize you never did actually get rid of the internal dialogue.  You just sort of suppressed it.  Which is good enough to move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the bottom it&amp;#39;s so different you won&amp;#39;t suppress it well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re up at the blue zone, trying to burn with the fire from within. I&amp;#39;m not sure if you weren&amp;#39;t 1000 miles above your body before that, having stretched your shell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s assume you could still light up everything, starting at your normal position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You move your assemblage point super fast down to the green, then the red, and finally you are on the bottom, all in 1 second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because you moved so fast, it&amp;#39;s all still glowing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have an internal dialogue down there in the red zone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You &amp;quot;understand&amp;quot; fine details of what it&amp;#39;s like down there.  You have opinions on them.  Memories. Triumphs, defeats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That won&amp;#39;t stop you from leaving the red zone and heading on to the Orange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you are a &amp;quot;Man of Knowledge&amp;#39;. They never learned to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Julian could certainly keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except, he encountered a little &amp;quot;skip&amp;quot; at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A delay.   His &amp;quot;red zone internal dialogue&amp;quot; kicked in, and held him back for an instant, the same way it holds all of us back at the top.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To keep all of the emanations lit up you have to move the entire distance in less than the time it takes the emanations to cool off after being made to glow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So too much fun in the red zone, is a problem if you want to learn to reach the 3rd attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, supposedly you can just sneak around the Eagle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s not turn this into a religious judgment on the bottom of the J curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll just sum it up in more simple terms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Play with Demons too much and you can&amp;#39;t get to heaven in time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe that&amp;#39;ll be rule #285.  Like the &amp;quot;rules of acquisition&amp;quot; on Star Trek.  There&amp;#39;s a lot of those, because the ones at the end of the list are dubious at best.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/o3inhw/candle_gazing_for_moving_from_the_bottom_to_the/h2c8tj2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1624121862.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_o3inhw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h2p0r8w", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Juann2323", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1624395347.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h2coy1m", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6gwhwg98", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I see the potential, but I don't like mirrors.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_h2p0r8w", "is_submitter": true, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see the potential, but I don&amp;#39;t like mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_o3inhw", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/o3inhw/candle_gazing_for_moving_from_the_bottom_to_the/h2p0r8w/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1624395347.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h52b9k6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Forest_Leafsheep1897", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1626200280.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h2coy1m", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_7elmqwkc", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I see the potential here, definitely!

I was thinking this just last night.\n\nI still can't make it to SK like I did the first time.

Probably stole a few from the rest of your guys, for that night.\n\nI just thought it was curious.  It never occurred to me that the Allies have ALWAYS helped sorcerers reach silent knowledge.\n\nThat's what they were doing in the lineages!\n\nEven the Men of Knowledge who could not reach SK, were  using Allies to \"channel it\" to them.\n\nSo there I was, being helped by no less than 6 inorganic beings, not realizing it.\n\nThey simply \"carried\" me there.\n\nI had to work hard to get close, but the rest of the way was beyond my abilities.\n\nThen the second night, when I also succeeded, I still had 3 of them.\n\nI had taken care to make sure I hadn't neglected my own 3, not realizing I was again \"surrounding\" myself with their help.

But you have to actually follow the steps given, which always include you having been learning to get silent, for years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t jump in and do the technique, without having any ability to get silent. It won&amp;#39;t work!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And everyone has pathetic levels of silence when they start, because they never had any &amp;quot;feedback&amp;quot;.  Something to help them know when they are on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect, no one believed any of it.  So they were only &amp;quot;pretending&amp;quot; to put in an effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make it work, you have to assume it&amp;#39;s all true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that if you get even a &amp;quot;tiny thing&amp;quot; to work, you have now proven to yourself, that the toothbrush can scrub one small circle the size of  your thumb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it can clean the entire barracks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like forest Gump, you do a little scrubbing, wondering if the tooth brush is up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you remove the brush, and look at the spot you cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And look next to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the spot is shiny and white, compared to the places you didn&amp;#39;t rub, now you have your &amp;quot;hook&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know for a fact, you can clean the entire barracks that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you feel a sense of dread, you aren&amp;#39;t cut out to learn sorcery without a lineage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You MUST be actually, literally pleased, to see that you finally got a little of it to work, confident you can &amp;quot;take it from there&amp;quot; by continuing to do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all the way at the end of the J curve, after you have so much magic no one will even believe you, you still come face to face with the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to clean the barrack toilets too, using only the tooth brush.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s not the bothersome part.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The coolest magical stuff  you do, is actually done by switching to the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;over&amp;quot;, you end up back where you started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wondering if you simply fell asleep and dreamed all that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was it even real?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to get over that, to eventually find the answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll be an acceptable answer when you do find it, so keep scrubbing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "link_id": "t3_tj3ikf", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/tj3ikf/call_to_an_ally/i1jrqsz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1647880878.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "collapsed": false, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 1, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i1kmos3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1647893075.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i1ixx4s", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt;\"The allies must come to you, then, because they're seeking his luminosity,\" she said, \"the luminosity he left with you.

Not because I believed that my sound would bring anything, but because I did not want to humor her.\n\nShe waited for a moment, and when she was sure I was not going to try, she put her hand to her mouth and imitated my tapping sound to perfection. She played it for five or six minutes, stopping only to breathe.\n\n\"See what I mean?\" she asked smiling. \"The allies don't give a fig about my calling, no matter how close it is to yours. Now try it yourself.\"\n\nI tried. After a few seconds I heard the call being answered. La Gorda jumped to her feet. I had the clear impression that she was more surprised than I was. She hurriedly made me stop, turned off the lantern and gathered up my notes.\n\nShe was about to open the front door, but she stopped short; a most frightening sound came from just outside the door. It sounded to me like a growl. It was so horrendous and ominous that it made us both jump back, away from the door. My physical alarm was so intense that I would have fled if I had had a place to go.\n\nSomething heavy was leaning against the door; it made the door creak. I looked at la Gorda.\n\nShe seemed to be even more alarmed. She was still standing with her arm outstretched as if to open the door. Her mouth was open. She seemed to have been frozen in midaction.\n\nThe door was about to be sprung open any moment. There were no bangs on it, just a terrifying pressure, not only on the door but all around the house.\n\nLa Gorda stood up and told me to embrace her quickly from behind, locking my hands around her waist over her belly button. She performed then a strange movement with her hands. It was as though she were flipping a towel while holding it at the level of her eyes. She did it four times.\n\nThen she made another strange movement. She placed her hands at the middle of her chest with the palms up, one above the other without touching. Her elbows were straight out to her sides.\n\nShe clasped her hands as if she had suddenly grabbed two unseen bars. She slowly turned her hands over until the palms were facing down and then she made a most beautiful, exertive movement, a movement that seemed to engage every muscle in her body. It was as though she were opening a heavy sliding door that offered a great resistance. Her body shivered with the exertion. Her arms moved slowly, as if opening a very, very heavy door, until they were fully extended laterally.\n\nI had the clear impression that as soon as she opened that door a wind rushed through. That wind pulled us and we actually went through the wall. Or rather, the walls of the house went through us, or perhaps all three, la Gorda, the house and myself, went through the door she had opened. All of a sudden I was out in an open field. I could see the dark shapes of the surrounding mountains and trees. I was no longer holding onto la Gorda's waist. A noise above me made me look up, and I saw her hovering perhaps ten feet above me like the black shape of a giant kite. I felt a terrible itch in my belly button and then la Gorda plummeted down to the ground at top speed, but instead of crashing she came to a soft, total halt.\n\nAt the moment that la Gorda landed, the itch in my umbilical region turned into a horribly exhausting nervous pain. It was as if her landing were pulling my insides out. I screamed in pain at the top of my voice.\n\nThen la Gorda was standing next to me, desperately out of breath. I was sitting down. We were again in the room of don Genaro's house where we had been.\n\nLa Gorda seemed unable to catch her breath.

There's a pattern to that, but I don't get it yet.](https://preview.redd.it/2s7yhdkj0ac81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89ef388bbcdbdea7fb3267713557d6065df95a44)\n\nDid Juann say someone found darkroom boring?\n\nI can identify with that.  I fact, I believe I can chart that out for you.\n\nWe start out living our lives from \"treat\" to treat.  We have it planned out.  If we do something as stupid as try to learn magic, it cuts into our \"treat time\".\n\nBut you hope that if you put in the time, treat time will become more exciting than sex, food,  or binge watching videos.\n\nAnd maybe you can even play videos on the walls of your room, without any equipment! Manifest hamburgers.  Doll up your inorganic being and take her into dreaming for a few minutes.\n\nWhat did Carlos say?  5 minutes was it?\n\nGee, I hope not. It's been a long time.\n\nThen once you give up your 20 minutes of \"treat time', and tell your friends it's 3 hours of hard work, you just fantasize.\n\nIt HURTS to force silence. So you look for a way out of it.\n\nThe problem is, no silence, no magic.  You can't cheat the system, because your thoughts are the VERY THING imprisoning you.  If you won't get rid of them, better get used to Jail sex.\n\nMost of those types of new students,  we lose in less than 2 weeks.  Hopefully they don't bother us with posts, and are smart enough to realize everyone can see through a new person who likes to post.\n\nIt's the OPPOSITE of someone who is going to succeed.\n\nI guess...  Maybe better put is, a trouble maker will be most remembered for how eager he was to post, before he'd actually done any work.\n\nBut if he doesn't make trouble, you forget whether he was an attention seeking baby when he first arrived.\n\nYou CANNOT learn sorcery.  So don't give me this, \"If I don't ask, how can I learn?\"\n\nYou have it backwards.  This isn't a phony \"spiritual\" system.\n\nIt's just technology.  And it's \"no thinking\" technology.  It's not \"understanding\" technology.\n\nThe ones who survive more than 2 weeks, and actually put in some time to learn silence, will see cool things.\n\nBut they're only cool, because you never saw those before.\n\nIf you stall out at any level on the J curve, you'll find yourself soon thinking, \"Yep. This is magic for sure!  I've kicked the butt of any meditation person I ever know.  But \"NCIS\" is on, and that goth lab chick has been wearing miniskirts lately...  And she still looks great for 86 years old.\"\n\nSo you're \"bored\".\n\nIt's not really true, but close enough.\n\nHowever, if you must know, that's not what's really going on.\n\nIt's more like this: once you've seen some magic once, you want to see more.\n\nIf the magic caused you to forget to emphasize SILENCE above all else, then instead or moving further on the J curve, you're looking around the room for something even more exciting.\n\nOnce you look around at any given level on the J curve, your assemblage point shifts sideways.\n\nYou start \"fine tuning\" reality to make what you are interested in \"more real\".\n\nYou pick something somewhat cool, like a pink streak in the air, and focus on \"streaks in general\", trying to get more of those.\n\nAnd you do!  But your assemblage point moves sideways to do that.\n\nAnd if it moves to the right you feel anxious, uncomfortable, angry, grumpy.\n\nEverything women feel on their period, when it's not going well.\n\nAnd THAT is what you misinterpret as boredom.\n\nThis never stops.  No matter how far you get on the J curve, if you want the excitement you had before you have to get more silent, so that more and more extreme things happen.\n\nFortunately, at some point  you have 100 amazing things you've seen, and can only repeat 2 or 3 of them.   So you have lots of diverting things to try, and you rapidly learn that silence is how you make those work best.\n\nLook...  It's that darned, \"Spirit\".  Those \"abstract cores\"?  Better keep those in mind.\n\nHe tricks us into learning, because when he tried the direct approach on us, we blew him off.\n\nSo he \"pushes you around\" by denying you what you want, unless you work harder than before.\n\nIf you work harder, you move further on the J curve, and things get crazier.\n\nStill, even in the orange zone you can get bored for a while.  Or, it's more like pain and tiredness.\n\nYou just need to keep going.\n\nUntil little dream scenes manifest on flat surfaces around you and are as vivid as a television, you're at risk of \"pain/tiredness boredom\".\n\nBut at the deep end of the orange zone, you reach \"silent knowledge\".\n\nSilent knowledge is endlessly entertaining.\n\nYou've finally reached something beyond your \"treats\".    It is in fact, \"the essence of treatness\".\n\nThen the problem becomes, how long can your dreaming attention last?\n\nWe don't have an unlimited amount.\n\nJust the same as a computer genius can get into a spell and do amazing things in his designs, he can't keep that up more than 12 hours before he has to stop and rest.\n\nThe brain starts to hurt.\n\nDreaming attention burns off a lot faster than ordinary intelligence.\n\nNormally, without precautions, 20 minutes will use up your dreaming attention.\n\nWith sunlight glitter, you can extend that to 1 hour, if you don't get too wasteful.\n\nBut to go longer, you need to learn tricks.  Don't stare.  Don't care.  Don't get involved.\n\nThat's also how you go \"star hopping\".\n\nYou just treat everything as if it were perfectly normal, and a little boring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Sky Gazing And Interstellar Travel", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Games"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "link_ids": ["t3_k5lacv", "t3_jsf8pf", "t3_jxyre8", "t3_jvzckj", "t3_k1pw9u", "t3_kn7u6f", "t3_jt41jy", "t3_l3me39", "t3_nyzmgn", "t3_o6l11h", "t3_o92x0p", "t3_pyq8vl", "t3_qw7izp", "t3_r3oz1f", "t3_rc8g7u", "t3_revm6o", "t3_rfsmoc", "t3_s689z9", "t3_su3roz", "t3_syswo6", "t3_t7h7z6", "t3_twxvbr", "t3_u6ktx2", "t3_ui1iwy", "t3_uo696x", "t3_vqjdmv", "t3_vy6llb", "t3_xywht5", "t3_z0qto6", "t3_zzzzyr", "t3_10h0u11", "t3_10mq6ds", "t3_10x4x85", "t3_13b33tr", "t3_13l62ly", "t3_13wp9x1", "t3_141hdwg", "t3_17tny4a", "t3_17wuuxc", "t3_19c63eh", "t3_x7e1t2", "t3_1b5mo8a"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Games", "created_at_utc": 1606954246.466, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "ecfcea81-de0a-4df2-95f0-092820881f4d", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1709501668.323, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"2s7yhdkj0ac81": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2s7yhdkj0ac81.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b1fdef51b536b285bf1fe5803751d4cf63adb55"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2s7yhdkj0ac81.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c86aa12cfa4bc39e047b657ef9fe3389305e911"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2s7yhdkj0ac81.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d88618c78a34176759103f9d32fae4444c31a75"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2s7yhdkj0ac81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e759a53b60bffd082abff8d9230949304fe9b567"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2s7yhdkj0ac81.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b59fcd1f4faa7a94a82e6ff68ba27e8ee11f89f"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2s7yhdkj0ac81.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32032f61b3593c9d0a6b49ae0b3663bd7aa4ba1d"}], "s": {"y": 1920, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/2s7yhdkj0ac81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89ef388bbcdbdea7fb3267713557d6065df95a44"}, "id": "2s7yhdkj0ac81"}}, "name": "t3_s689z9", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 33, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Games", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 33, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jtG6MAOLkzW5Yw029QKRSbQcaZjuwM0303dY3lljoG0.jpg", "edited": 1642439283.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1642437596.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/2s7yhdkj0ac81.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=89ef388bbcdbdea7fb3267713557d6065df95a44\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s rare I find anything easily repeatable.

You're on Venus, and I'm from Neptune.\n\nIt sounds like your internal dialogue is \"non-standard\".\n\nMale or female?\n\nAnd can you shut off your internal dialog a while?\n\nHow long?\n\nI'm trying to figure out if there's any point for you to stay in here.\n\nI don't mean, whether you'll be a trouble maker.\n\nI'd say no now.\n\nBut whether you really want to learn magic, or it's something else I can't fathom.\n\nIt can't be something else, or you are wasting your time in here.\n\nYou sort of have to want to hold a demon on your hand, for real. Or you won't work hard enough to see the other stuff.\n\nThere's no point in hanging around just for the \"sake of knowledge\" because sorcery is \"irrelevant\".   It's the discarded part of our existence.\n\nIt's only good, for learning sorcery.\n\nAnd to answer your question, I'm interested in sorcery because I was attacked by a demon at age 5.\n\nThat pretty much sums it up.  He kept coming back, I kind of liked it, so  eventually chased him into dreaming, and found out how to kick a hole in any wall, and go into his world. I planned revenge, but I never got past the tunnels into the main area.  They started as a playground style \"slide\", but once you were underground they couldn't be called anything but tunnels.  And they got so narrow, you got stuck too much to slide further.\n\nIt did however, cause me to believe the dreaming world was just another place, and not a different thing entirely.  I learned to repeat fun activities there, like jumping from a huge tree.\n\nLater, I was remote viewing my father downstairs at night, until he got pissed off and told me to stop that.  He actually believed in sorcery, working at the reservation studying the shamans.\n\nThen, coincidentally, my father decided to drop me off to play at the very Indian reservation where Carlos first went to find don Juan.\n\nHe left me with one of two.  The dreaming sorceress, or the Devil's weed sorcerer.\n\nWhile he worked on their printing press/publishing house. I'm not sure, but I believe he actually created it in the first place. He never took much credit for his \"hobbies\".\n\nBut the main companion I had, was Elmer. A tall thin dark man with a shotgun.  He followed me everywhere, but I only saw him when I was about to do something dangerous.\n\nLike climb under the out hose to see if the possum I'd been chasing, was down there. He showed up and gave me a lecture on hunting bears in that valley, to change the subject.\n\nI got the impression he was Ruby Modesto's lover.  She was the tribal witch.\n\nThere she is:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Not-Innocent-Ears-Spiritual-Traditions/dp/0960446206](https://www.amazon.com/Not-Innocent-Ears-Spiritual-Traditions/dp/0960446206)\n\nShe scared the hell out of me.  It was about the time I was hanging out with her, that I started to see that purple \"whorl\" Carlos described in his last books, above me at night.

Or you won&amp;#39;t work hard enough to see the other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no point in hanging around just for the &amp;quot;sake of knowledge&amp;quot; because sorcery is &amp;quot;irrelevant&amp;quot;.   It&amp;#39;s the discarded part of our existence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only good, for learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And to answer your question, I&amp;#39;m interested in sorcery because I was attacked by a demon at age 5.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That pretty much sums it up.  He kept coming back, I kind of liked it, so  eventually chased him into dreaming, and found out how to kick a hole in any wall, and go into his world. I planned revenge, but I never got past the tunnels into the main area.  They started as a playground style &amp;quot;slide&amp;quot;, but once you were underground they couldn&amp;#39;t be called anything but tunnels.  And they got so narrow, you got stuck too much to slide further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It did however, cause me to believe the dreaming world was just another place, and not a different thing entirely.  I learned to repeat fun activities there, like jumping from a huge tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later, I was remote viewing my father downstairs at night, until he got pissed off and told me to stop that.  He actually believed in sorcery, working at the reservation studying the shamans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, coincidentally, my father decided to drop me off to play at the very Indian reservation where Carlos first went to find don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He left me with one of two.  The dreaming sorceress, or the Devil&amp;#39;s weed sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While he worked on their printing press/publishing house. I&amp;#39;m not sure, but I believe he actually created it in the first place. He never took much credit for his &amp;quot;hobbies&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the main companion I had, was Elmer. A tall thin dark man with a shotgun.  He followed me everywhere, but I only saw him when I was about to do something dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like climb under the out hose to see if the possum I&amp;#39;d been chasing, was down there. He showed up and gave me a lecture on hunting bears in that valley, to change the subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got the impression he was Ruby Modesto&amp;#39;s lover.  She was the tribal witch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There she is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Not-Innocent-Ears-Spiritual-Traditions/dp/0960446206\"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Not-Innocent-Ears-Spiritual-Traditions/dp/0960446206&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She scared the hell out of me.  It was about the time I was hanging out with her, that I started to see that purple &amp;quot;whorl&amp;quot; Carlos described in his last books, above me at night.

You should do it!  You'll go crazy with power.\n\nRemember that scene from star wars where the evil Palpatine is showing lightening bolts at someone, screaming \"UNLIMITED POWER!!!\"\n\nYou'll do that once in a while. Minus the loud noise that would summon the police.\n\nIt's really nice to have the actual thing reliably, for hours each night.\n\nRight now you're \"interested\".  And maybe even talented.\n\nBut it's not real yet!\n\nOnce a month or a year cool experiences won't do anyone any good, other than to give them a tiny bit of motivation to try harder.\n\nBut once a night, for hours, is like hiking up to the mountains to learn about what's there.\n\nIt's vast, and takes a long time to explore, but each sight is a miracle.\n\nLet me taunt you!\n\nThe tensegrity attracts our double.  He's the same person we play nightly in dreams, but not much use when he's stuck in there.  And he's irrational, so we can't take him over and learn that way. Some have tried, but in 50 years no one has succeeded with that.\n\nWaking dreaming however is the opposite.  Instead of going in to \"grab\" him, we lure him out with stuff he finds interesting.\n\nHe becomes your assistant.\n\nThe pattern is in the books.   The teacher Julian picked up don Juan and threw him into a raging river, in order to lure don Juan's double to come out to save him.\n\nThat's possible once they take an interest in you.  Before that, being tossed into a river would be pointless.\n\nIn the same way they'll come out to rescue us, they come out to help us when we try to do something impossible.\n\nSo you can learn to use your waking dreaming to see the stars above you, and if you can \"zoom in\" using your fingers, that means, the double is interested and will help you.\n\nYou can literally leap to the zoomed in star.\n\nDon't ask me how what's possible.  I suppose you switch to the double.\n\nBut what happens to the flesh body?\n\nI just don't know, there's no evidence you fell to the floor or climbed back into bed.\n\nSo if you want to explore alien consciousness, that technique is wonderful.  I suppose we're talking in the thread about it, I hadn't noticed.\n\nBUT, it has a hidden side.  My guess, with sorcery there's ALWAYS more.\n\nAnytime the double is around you, there's a \"space between\" you.\n\nIf you have a good relationship with it (doesn't have to be perfect yet),  you can get a glimpse of  his thoughts.\n\nYou move back and forth between you and  him, and discover \"something\" in the middle.\n\nThe abstract.\n\nThe abstract is a vast expanse, which voids any understanding we have of conscious.\n\nIt goes beyond any \"wise sayings\" ever written.

Minus the loud noise that would summon the police.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really nice to have the actual thing reliably, for hours each night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now you&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;interested&amp;quot;.  And maybe even talented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not real yet!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once a month or a year cool experiences won&amp;#39;t do anyone any good, other than to give them a tiny bit of motivation to try harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But once a night, for hours, is like hiking up to the mountains to learn about what&amp;#39;s there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s vast, and takes a long time to explore, but each sight is a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me taunt you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tensegrity attracts our double.  He&amp;#39;s the same person we play nightly in dreams, but not much use when he&amp;#39;s stuck in there.  And he&amp;#39;s irrational, so we can&amp;#39;t take him over and learn that way. Some have tried, but in 50 years no one has succeeded with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Waking dreaming however is the opposite.  Instead of going in to &amp;quot;grab&amp;quot; him, we lure him out with stuff he finds interesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He becomes your assistant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pattern is in the books.   The teacher Julian picked up don Juan and threw him into a raging river, in order to lure don Juan&amp;#39;s double to come out to save him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s possible once they take an interest in you.  Before that, being tossed into a river would be pointless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the same way they&amp;#39;ll come out to rescue us, they come out to help us when we try to do something impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you can learn to use your waking dreaming to see the stars above you, and if you can &amp;quot;zoom in&amp;quot; using your fingers, that means, the double is interested and will help you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can literally leap to the zoomed in star.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t ask me how what&amp;#39;s possible.  I suppose you switch to the double.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what happens to the flesh body?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know, there&amp;#39;s no evidence you fell to the floor or climbed back into bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you want to explore alien consciousness, that technique is wonderful.  I suppose we&amp;#39;re talking in the thread about it, I hadn&amp;#39;t noticed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, it has a hidden side.  My guess, with sorcery there&amp;#39;s ALWAYS more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anytime the double is around you, there&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;space between&amp;quot; you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a good relationship with it (doesn&amp;#39;t have to be perfect yet),  you can get a glimpse of  his thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You move back and forth between you and  him, and discover &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The abstract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The abstract is a vast expanse, which voids any understanding we have of conscious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It goes beyond any &amp;quot;wise sayings&amp;quot; ever written.  I don&amp;#39;t believe any other system has actual knowledge of it, from experience.  Maybe some very old writings that &amp;quot;almost match&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we get to swim in it, like it was an ocean.

I knew it made no sense at all, but I&amp;#39;d promised...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I discovered 2 amazing new techniques, and was desperate to stop practicing, and come write them up in here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One was based on the fact that the most important thing Carlos ever did in private class, was the Pandora&amp;#39;s Box pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using what I realized, I figured out hot to generate red zone silent knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That path shows us that the puffs can be collected together into balls, even if they are thinly distributed in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that by playing with them as real, you can fine tune them to store &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then the object is energized, and can be used to alter your space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you apply the same knowledge to all of the puffs in the room,  they all become energized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The glow of the energized puffs all around you, makes dream videos available in any direction  you look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Red zone silent knowledge is sort of like &amp;quot;street smarts&amp;quot; compared to orange zone silent knowledge, which is definitely at a &amp;quot;higher&amp;quot; level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I forgot the second technique I got from that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it involved materializing &amp;quot;beings&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which was the other side of Pandora&amp;#39;s box.

And also that his doctor would not be able to keep him alive much longer.\n\nMy understanding of the situation at this point, with my experience actually making the magical passes work, is that Carlos wanted to take his time on students. Don\u2019t get them into the second attention too quickly because it causes trouble for the teacher.\n\nAnd he was in a unique situation. He had thousands of students!\n\nYou can\u2019t just unleash magic on them!\n\nLet them recap and do tensegrity, and hopefully hose off a bit so that they aren\u2019t covered in emotional problems.\n\nDaniel Ingram, the Dzogchen master, says that\u2019s what goes on in Buddhism too. They\u2019ve removed the magic, because it\u2019s too much trouble.\n\nShinzen Young sort of implies that, when he talks about his own fairy (IOB) drumming on his hand, and then ignores it as a curiosity. He\u2019s from the Chinese Zen school. They pretty much tell everyone to ignore the interesting stuff.\n\nMeanwhile, it seems the Buddha never intended to have the magic stripped out!\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s what made him such a hit back then. As I recall, he was even selling specific techniques, like a modern day new age guru. Flying technique: $3000.\n\n(Yea, I bought that one.)\n\nPeople love real magic! The only problem is, they NEVER GET ANY.\n\nWe\u2019ll, here\u2019s some for you. And me with no motivation to fool you.  I have no books for sale, no workshops, I'd kill myself if I had to handle personal consolations by phone,  and it only hurts my reputation to put this on the web.\n\nI sell stuff to Harvard, NASA, and several universities around the world.  It doesn't help me if one of them asks his manager, \"Is it ok to buy equipment from a guy who thinks he owns a fairy?\"\n\nWell. That's not completely right.\n\nSelling chip designs to high tech manufacturers in Asia isn't hurt. They're ok with sorcery.\n\nBut it's not a plus.\n\nAs for the validity of this technique, Daniel Ingram will back up the fact that you can learn to make it work.\n\nAnd Shinzen too.\n\nIf they looked at it they\u2019d say, \u201cYep, that\u2019s possible. I can do something similar.\u201d\n\nYes, you \"can do\".\n\nLikely to?   Nope.\n\nToo much work to move that assemblage point. You'd have to give up piano practice. Or basketball.\n\nOr TV.\n\nAnd lets face it:  Students are nuts. Crazy.\n\nOn ego trips. Annoying. Petty. Selfish. Competitive.\n\nWell... The men are.\n\nThey say they want magic, but what they really want is attention.\n\nThe women have their own motives. I don\u2019t quite understand them, but I suspect they\u2019re just as sinister.\n\nI won\u2019t go into the nasty things that can happen when people encounter real magic.\n\nBut it can get ugly fast.\n\nJust read Carlos\u2019 books.\n\nAnd so Carlos, having held us back from the scarier parts of the second attention (waking magic), finally had to give in.\n\nHe gave us several dangerous techniques.\n\nThis was one of them.\n\nThe pictures should be self-explanatory. If not, please ask!  It\u2019s for everyone\u2019s benefit.\n\nI do this in darkness, because it\u2019s a lot easier. And a lot less scary!\n\nBut Carlos attempted to do this for us in full light.\n\nNo one saw whatever he manifested. He didn\u2019t have enough power to cancel out our shittiness (Tonal).\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter. He had a grin on his face anyway, as he looked right at me.\n\nI should have watched to see who else he stared at and grinned.\n\nIt was a challenge to those whom he knew might follow up, to put in the huge amount of effort to make that technique work.\n\nThat huge amount of work amounts to, learning to move your assemblage point to where that technique always works.\n\nHeightened awareness is one such point.\n\nAnd so, unless you can form and visually see balls of light in darkness, forget this magical pass.\n\nIt\u2019s not really even all that precise.\n\nI\u2019ve done this as a whirlpool of the blackness, instead of the light, and extracted multiple objects using it.\n\nBut this one, when done right, is pretty creepy. A tingle will go up your spine and all the way to the top of your head, which will tickle for a while after that.\n\nI suggest skipping the 60s stereo type Japanese Bunny that don Juan manifested for Carlos using a slight variation of this technique.\n\nGo for Cholita\u2019s fav:\n\nDead people!\n\nIt\u2019s more frightening to manifest evil ghosts!\n\nOf course, they aren\u2019t really.\n\nThey\u2019re just one person\u2019s intent. Not all that substantial without another person\u2019s intent.\n\nIf you wanted a bunny, you could get one of those too. But when your skills are that great, you'll probably be rivaling Silvio Manuel.\n\nJust go for a general category at first.\n\nDon't debug 2 things at once.  That's an engineering rule.\n\nThe manifestations melt after a few seconds, and end up as a puddle of sparks on the floor.\n\nI believe this is the same technique used by the famous Witch of Endor, in the old testament.\n\nI'd like to warn you that the real thing, when you do it, is not as precise as the images.  The balls won't be as well formed, and there will be a vague purple or blue fog around the ball, so that you're really just compressing the middle of a cloud, rather than forming  a hard ball.\n\nExcept, that really just depends on the position of the assemblage point.\n\nIt can, and will, be this precise on occasion.\n\nThat's when you start trying to figure out why?  Why did it work so well today, but not all of last month?  And why does it stop being that cool the next day?\n\nSo you end up with impeccable warrior concerns. Saving energy, not-doing, erasing personal history, taking responsibility.\n\nAll the stuff beginners should forget about, until they actually have some magic to measure the results by.\n\nTrying to be \"impeccable\" before you have magic, is like trying to do this pass, before you can see the chi balls.\n\nI'm sure some will say, \"But the books say...\"\n\nNo. You didn't read it well!\n\nWith Carlos having his life filled with magic, under the power of don Juan, they gave him behavior recommendations to make it all work better.\n\nHe had the magic first.  \n\nYou don't be impeccable to \"earn magic\".\n\nIt's not a reward/punishment system like you're used to.\n\nThere's no hazing to get the real  thing. That's where Zen fails so miserably.\n\nThey teach that you have to get hazed, in order to earn \"Zen\".\n\nIt's completely wrong.  You get there on your own, with hard work.\n\nAnd then, you try to keep it going with impeccability.\n\nOne night you get good results, the next not.  \n\nThe difference?\n\n3 episodes of Magnum PI, instead of just 1.\n\nWhich means 3 glasses of wine, instead of 1.\n\nIt's all pretty obvious if you have a measuring tool (internal silence).\n\nYou learn what impeccability is, by watching how much magic you can produce.\n\nA warning about not-doing. Someone asked the other day. I tried it.\n\nDon't.  It's like Dr. Who \"reversing the polarity\" on something.\n\nIt always has crazy results.\n\nIf you're doing fine making something work, skip the not-doing for a while.\n\nIf nothing is working, then do a bunch of it.\n\nEdited four times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Pandora's Box Pass (How to Manifest Things)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tensegrity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"ikb6cbhv2j251": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ikb6cbhv2j251.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2caf3e8c470bfb40f5971332137300514f22173e"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ikb6cbhv2j251.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32cdb1939439376cd30147cd9be0fd74b8dc2441"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ikb6cbhv2j251.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=167153dca98be35b0fac64b493b38a6f6edba091"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ikb6cbhv2j251.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23258e5f39a4f7a0ca6c0be37e26e77f9b68c263"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ikb6cbhv2j251.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e7c49897b3ed7dbe21078b03e1eb6b5db8e83da"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ikb6cbhv2j251.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87af3bedc8b18fd98eaefe90d03a27aff99504c4"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/ikb6cbhv2j251.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f47a4df6e14986230de8144293a271dbe08a07e"}, "id": "ikb6cbhv2j251"}}, "name": "t3_gvb3v4", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Tensegrity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 20, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Dn4jfd8b9qB9CI-J-QZhWRJdl63j4Wa36t6b82Opr0U.jpg", "edited": 1591123394.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1591117269.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ikb6cbhv2j251.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8f47a4df6e14986230de8144293a271dbe08a07e\"&gt;Private Class Magical Pass &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At some point in private classes it became obvious to Carlos that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to jump grooves and get rid of his illness.

Yea, sure. The problem with those, however, is that they're trying to get themselves endorsed by the scientific community.\n&gt; \n&gt; It's even worse than Buddhists trying to fit what they discover into the Buddhist religion context.\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nScience's turn to materialism with Kant has produced an obsession with Objective Reality (which is a peculiar but particularly effective way of creating a world, in this case a world which intersects with the Tonal).  So many of the problems faced by spiritual people are because they are trying to force Science to address phenomenon which it has specifically excluded from being able to study.  People inner lives proper are off limits to Science.  Science can only deal with external reports of internal states, NEVER the internal states themselves.\n\n&gt;But the old sorcerers surely believed you could add energy. They even cannibalized other people to get that energy.\n&gt;\n&gt;How to resolve that argument? I have no idea.\n\nI do.\n\nBut I'm not comfortable discussing in public why the old sorcerers thought cannibalism for energy was a good idea or how they went about it (too much downside risk).  Shoot me a message if you want an off-public discussion on the subject, because I trust you not to abuse the knowledge, but you are a rare case.\n\n&gt;Are you sure that's how it works?\n&gt;\n&gt;It certainly seems to.\n&gt;\n&gt;But my suspicion is that it's only the playing with it, as if it were &gt;real, that helps with the detail.\n&gt;\n&gt;And that because your assemblage point moves.\n&gt;\n&gt;So moving the assemblage point is the main thing.\n\nMy take on the chi-ball/tulpa is that a tripartite technique is being used.  There's the practice of physically/psychically creating the chi-balls with mind/motion.  This gathers together the raw chi for the next step.\n\nOnce gathered, the chi is compacted and condensed as you describe in the pass.  This creates and forms the chi-ball.  The compacting adds energy to the chi-ball, which should start to shift the color toward blue.  You have a limit to how much you can compress a chi-ball, which puts a limit on how much energy you can add by that method (being good at compression comes in handy later in more advanced techniques when the struggle is to hold the chi-ball together from all the energy you've added)\n\nNext, *intent* carves and energized the chi-ball.  As you know, *intent* can flow any way it decides, but the easiest I've found to power the chi-ball is to pass energy to it through my hands (this is similar to a \"healing touch\" type mental process).  The best way I've found to do this is to pulse the *intent* energy with the compaction movements.  \"Playing with it\" like you describe imparts *intent* to it, which carves and adds detail.\n\nEnergizing the chi-ball also adds to its substance beyond what you gathered together.  It's this extra substance which allows for greater detail when the chi-ball is carved (that's what I meant by helping with the detail, sort of like adding pixels to a screen increases the detail).\n\nThe next step in technique that I use is to set up a vortex within the chi-ball.  I do this by adding a \"jar twisting\" motion to the hands as I compress (always remembering to relax and untwist on the upstroke of the compression).

So many of the problems faced by spiritual people are because they are trying to force Science to address phenomenon which it has specifically excluded from being able to study.  People inner lives proper are off limits to Science.  Science can only deal with external reports of internal states, NEVER the internal states themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the old sorcerers surely believed you could add energy. They even cannibalized other people to get that energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to resolve that argument? I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m not comfortable discussing in public why the old sorcerers thought cannibalism for energy was a good idea or how they went about it (too much downside risk).  Shoot me a message if you want an off-public discussion on the subject, because I trust you not to abuse the knowledge, but you are a rare case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are you sure that&amp;#39;s how it works?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It certainly seems to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But my suspicion is that it&amp;#39;s only the playing with it, as if it were &amp;gt;real, that helps with the detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that because your assemblage point moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So moving the assemblage point is the main thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My take on the chi-ball/tulpa is that a tripartite technique is being used.  There&amp;#39;s the practice of physically/psychically creating the chi-balls with mind/motion.  This gathers together the raw chi for the next step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once gathered, the chi is compacted and condensed as you describe in the pass.  This creates and forms the chi-ball.  The compacting adds energy to the chi-ball, which should start to shift the color toward blue.  You have a limit to how much you can compress a chi-ball, which puts a limit on how much energy you can add by that method (being good at compression comes in handy later in more advanced techniques when the struggle is to hold the chi-ball together from all the energy you&amp;#39;ve added)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; carves and energized the chi-ball.  As you know, &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; can flow any way it decides, but the easiest I&amp;#39;ve found to power the chi-ball is to pass energy to it through my hands (this is similar to a &amp;quot;healing touch&amp;quot; type mental process).  The best way I&amp;#39;ve found to do this is to pulse the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; energy with the compaction movements.  &amp;quot;Playing with it&amp;quot; like you describe imparts &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; to it, which carves and adds detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Energizing the chi-ball also adds to its substance beyond what you gathered together.  It&amp;#39;s this extra substance which allows for greater detail when the chi-ball is carved (that&amp;#39;s what I meant by helping with the detail, sort of like adding pixels to a screen increases the detail).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next step in technique that I use is to set up a vortex within the chi-ball.  I do this by adding a &amp;quot;jar twisting&amp;quot; motion to the hands as I compress (always remembering to relax and untwist on the upstroke of the compression).  By setting up an internal motion, more energy can be stored, enormously exceeding that compression limit.  The next stage of energy is reached when you compression limit can no longer sustain the energy the vortex adds and your chi-ball wants to fly apart (it&amp;#39;s a pretty effect, so mistakes can be fun).

Even when he set it down.\n\nEventually he could rip flesh from someone's face with one hand.\n\nNice guy...   Liked to talk to ants as I recall.\n\nYou do the same thing but using 2 hands.  At the end the hands are really close together, like they were clinging to a golf ball in the middle, but trying to hide it. Or at least every visible part.\n\nWhen you do it your hands will be in front of you, for maximum ease of crushing the ball smaller.  But don't ignore the compressing part, where you should literally see a ball of intense purple or blue light, being crushed and deformed to get smaller and smaller.\n\nThis one can only be done with the double's eyes.  It has to turn, \"real\". Not follow the eyes around.\n\nThen just \"smoothly\" move it to your right side, so that when a dead zombie jumps out of it and is full sized, he's standing next to you instead of facing you.\n\nZombies have very bad breath.\n\nNow if you want to imitate Carlos (I recommend it), you look around the room while your hands are still holding the energy ball.  With a silly grin.  You scan the audience to see if there's anything you ought to know, before releasing the monster.\n\nWhen the coast looks clear, you pull your right hand off  along a large curve, so it makes a \"big deal\" out of revealing the energy, and also the right hand moves far away from it.\n\nThe left hand is still just cupped, pointing to the ceiling, holding \"the ball\".\n\nJust assume Frankenstein is going to spill out of your hand as liquid sparkling dust, and bloom up to full size.  If you see fibrous blue instead of purple blob, that's a very good sign.\n\nSo you have to hold both hands to your right before opening it, and the right hand curves off fairly fast, and more towards the back right side, to get out of the way of the inevitable demonic being.\n\nOr it could be bugs bunny that shows up.\n\nThe first time likely only leaks fairy dust to the floor.\n\nBut do it again!  It's darned Fairy dust!  Isn't that good enough for you???\n\nTry it again!\n\nWorks every single time for me, as long as I built up my energy body enough to be visible.\n\nHowever, the resulting dead guy is very transparent.  Like a ghost.\n\nNot at all like the one Cholita showed me, who was strong enough to carry her.\n\nSo it's not tempting to keep playing with the \"manifested\" one.  \n\nBut it's enough to manifest him!\n\nGood rule of thumb:  If you can't tell your mom, that's **good** magic!\n\nIf you can do that and make a being appear, you can sit up on pillows on the bed, reach behind it without looking, and pull out object after object.\n\nBut \"recompress\" your energy body a big first.   \n\nThen you have a better chance of doing it over and over with smaller objects like pencils and hamburgers.\n\nThe way don Juan and Genaro did.\n\nWe REALLY need to study this sort of thing more.\n\nBasically it's a \"controlled switch\" to your double, which you can't detect at all.\n\nThe old lineage might have been content with switches you can't detect. Those feel \"natural\".\n\nBut I'd rather know the mechanics of it.\n\nExcept maybe they did know that part, or else how could Genaro have physically stepped out of a vision Carlos was having of him.\n\nYou know what's really cool?\n\nThe books are almost surely 100% true.

But don&amp;#39;t ignore the compressing part, where you should literally see a ball of intense purple or blue light, being crushed and deformed to get smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one can only be done with the double&amp;#39;s eyes.  It has to turn, &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;. Not follow the eyes around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then just &amp;quot;smoothly&amp;quot; move it to your right side, so that when a dead zombie jumps out of it and is full sized, he&amp;#39;s standing next to you instead of facing you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Zombies have very bad breath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if you want to imitate Carlos (I recommend it), you look around the room while your hands are still holding the energy ball.  With a silly grin.  You scan the audience to see if there&amp;#39;s anything you ought to know, before releasing the monster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the coast looks clear, you pull your right hand off  along a large curve, so it makes a &amp;quot;big deal&amp;quot; out of revealing the energy, and also the right hand moves far away from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The left hand is still just cupped, pointing to the ceiling, holding &amp;quot;the ball&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just assume Frankenstein is going to spill out of your hand as liquid sparkling dust, and bloom up to full size.  If you see fibrous blue instead of purple blob, that&amp;#39;s a very good sign.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you have to hold both hands to your right before opening it, and the right hand curves off fairly fast, and more towards the back right side, to get out of the way of the inevitable demonic being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or it could be bugs bunny that shows up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first time likely only leaks fairy dust to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But do it again!  It&amp;#39;s darned Fairy dust!  Isn&amp;#39;t that good enough for you???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try it again!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Works every single time for me, as long as I built up my energy body enough to be visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the resulting dead guy is very transparent.  Like a ghost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not at all like the one Cholita showed me, who was strong enough to carry her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s not tempting to keep playing with the &amp;quot;manifested&amp;quot; one.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s enough to manifest him!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good rule of thumb:  If you can&amp;#39;t tell your mom, that&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; magic!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can do that and make a being appear, you can sit up on pillows on the bed, reach behind it without looking, and pull out object after object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But &amp;quot;recompress&amp;quot; your energy body a big first.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you have a better chance of doing it over and over with smaller objects like pencils and hamburgers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way don Juan and Genaro did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We REALLY need to study this sort of thing more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;controlled switch&amp;quot; to your double, which you can&amp;#39;t detect at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old lineage might have been content with switches you can&amp;#39;t detect. Those feel &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;d rather know the mechanics of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except maybe they did know that part, or else how could Genaro have physically stepped out of a vision Carlos was having of him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You know what&amp;#39;s really cool?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The books are almost surely 100% true.

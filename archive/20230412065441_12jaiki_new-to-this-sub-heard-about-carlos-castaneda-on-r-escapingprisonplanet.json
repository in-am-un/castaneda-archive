The rest are on YouTube which isn&amp;#39;t as convenient. The books are presented as a story of Castaneda&amp;#39;s encounters and training with the Sorcerer Don Juan, and even just from a story telling perspective it&amp;#39;s fantastic to listen to. It is very entertaining and compelling. As a beginner, just listen to the first book and if it feels good, listen to the next two and THEN jump into the subreddit. I tried to compare all my previous knowledge to this stuff and it doesn&amp;#39;t hold up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There mods in here actually know what they&amp;#39;re doing and are giving their time and intent for others to learn. If you spend enough time reading around in here after reading the books, things will start to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/12jaiki/new_to_this_sub_heard_about_carlos_castaneda_on/jfz0kke/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1681312281.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_12jaiki", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jfxj2z3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Ok-Assistance175", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1681278662.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_12jaiki", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_9qdplfxw", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Start with the Menu&gt;wiki section and read the introduction to discover what this tech is all about.\nReading the books will help too, as long as you don\u2019t get caught up in the warrior inventory crap.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_jfxj2z3", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with the Menu&amp;gt;wiki section and read the introduction to discover what this tech is all about.\nReading the books will help too, as long as you don\u2019t get caught up in the warrior inventory crap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/12jaiki/new_to_this_sub_heard_about_carlos_castaneda_on/jfxj2z3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1681278662.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_12jaiki", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "before": null}}]

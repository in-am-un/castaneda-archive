It was a liquid light.  I noticed that perceiving was more than sighting; it was ***feeling.*** The pool of dark, liquid light had an extraordinary depth. It was \"friendly,\" \"kind.\" The light that emanated from it did not explode but whirled slowly inward, creating exquisite reflections. The glow had a very lovely and delicate way of touching me, of soothing me, which gave me a sensation of exquisiteness.  I saw a symmetrical ring of brilliant dashes of light that expanded rhythmically on the vertical plain of the glowing area. The ring expanded to cover nearly all the glowing surface and then contracted to a point of light in the middle of the brilliant pool. I saw the ring expanding and contracting several times. Then I deliberately moved back without losing my gaze and was capable of seeing both eyes. I distinguished the rhythm of both types of light explosions. The left eye sent out dashes of tight that actually protruded out of the vertical plain, while the right eye sent out dashes that radiated without protruding. The rhythm of the two eyes was alternating, the light of the left eye exploded outward while the radiating light beams of the right eye contracted and whirled inward. Then the light of the right eye extended to cover the whole glowing surface while the exploding light of the left eye receded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIll add that the left eye is controlled by the \"silent\" right hemisphere of the brain.

And thanks to \"Enlightenment\" YouTube channel!\n\nMy guess on the red hue?\n\nIt's Fairy.  You have some of her energy now.\n\nBut who knows.   Hopefully we'll  see what colors others have.\n\nAnother user sees a yellowish white where their torso is, when they look down. They can literally see their lower body, in perfect darkness!  Even the legs, in a blurry condition.\n\nExcept, they're seeing about 4 inches more of the torso than you can in light.\n\nWhich from my experience is the location of the second attention's energy body.  It's a little \"fatter\" than our real one.  When you perceive the wavy lines there, it sort of tells you where the precise edge of that body is.  They don't wave beyond that point, only outwards.\n\nAll of that \"sort of\", because it's pretty unlike this reality and doesn't translate perfectly.\n\nIf you get good at that, you realize you always knew how to perceive that way. And you remember doing it as a child, then ignoring it because no one else would talk about it.\n\nWe gave up sorcery for \"cozy\".\n\nPerhaps anyone worried about getting your tummy the firmest by removing those last 5 pounds, should remember that the energy body is kind of \"chubby\".\n\n3D vision?  More likely you're borrowing your dreaming double's eyes.\n\nI almost located him last night.  Try looking just behind your left shoulder, but slightly out, as if he were resting his head on your left shoulder to gaze where you are gazing.\n\nJust in case anyone missed it, I believe the dreaming double comes into the practice room, because if it didn't, I couldn't leap through a solid wall into other worlds.\n\nWhich I can.  So it has to be the dreaming double taking over.

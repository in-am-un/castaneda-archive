It was disorienting - I didn&amp;#39;t recognize the (normal usual tonal) world I was returning too.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have to keep something when changing tracks/worlds, right, in order to choose, so it&amp;#39;s not random like a sleeping dream but an intentional &amp;quot;I will go try this world&amp;quot;. My interpretation right now is that by giving up a sense of self + personal history we have access to other worlds with other histories. And even other entirely different modes of being. I want to move between worlds with a sense of choice, so I don&amp;#39;t get stuck in any particular one.  Is that a good approach / misguided? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You erase your &amp;quot;self&amp;quot;.

In practicing imagination I&amp;#39;ve found imagining specific feelings &amp;amp; situations is pleasant but I have a growing recognition that the drive for certain feelings &amp;amp; situations is derived from or driven by a reaction to my personal history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More concretely, suppose I like skiing, should I be intending to visit other worlds where I&amp;#39;m skiing, or approach completely silent minded, and whatever world comes up - it might be a surprise but still great to experience and I can decide at the time?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found I can quiet chatter by focusing on 1 specific thing at a time - it&amp;#39;s incredible how difficult this is, with thought strands trying to pull my attention. Is focusing on 1 specific imagination like skiing a good practice for reaching silence or is that only &amp;quot;changing the channel, not turning off the television&amp;quot;?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My instinct is that focusing is good for recognizing the channel changes to better change as needed and that practicing focus will make shutting off (go silent) easier.

I got excited thinking maybe it was her, returned from wherever she\u2019d gone.\n\nBut Fancy likes to puzzle me when she first appears, and does imitations of Fairy.\n\nI kept asking the little woman\u2019s face in my hand, \u201cWho are you???\u201d\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t tell.\n\nI blew into the tiny head. It got brighter, but there was a 5 second delay.\n\nI hadn\u2019t noticed that before. I blew over and over, and it got more and more solid looking.\n\nBlue is the color it became. Fairy is pink, but I\u2019d forgotten that. When you move that far into the second attention, you don\u2019t keep track of random details like that.\n\nI became excited at the prospect of having my original inorganic being, \u201cFairy\u201d, stand up and actually walk on my palm. It would give anyone goosebumps.\n\nBut Bob made his usual appearance, resolving the issue.\n\nIf Bob is there, it\u2019s Fancy. Bob seems to be her sidekick.\n\nI\u2019m starting to think that\u2019s common. For IOBs to have their own IOB.\n\nFancy decided to reveal herself after her passionate kiss with Bob.\n\nApparently when Bob drifted in, she disappeared from my hand.\n\nNow she was normal size, floating in the air in front of me.\n\nI was trying to do again, what I had done the night before. Enter into a puff of purple light, and play with the insides.\n\nBut Fancy seemed tired of that game.\n\nShe\u2019d coaxed me into doing that herself. Now she had other plans.\n\nI suppose once you realize that inorganic beings like to teach us, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising to find out that they aren\u2019t always subtle about it.\n\nAnd now I had Fancy stuck to my hand.  It was as if she didn\u2019t want me to go inside puffs of color anymore.\n\nI shook my hand to get her off, but she wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\nIf any of you still worries your colors are not directional, fear not.\n\nShe was 100% directional! And stuck to my hand like a big blob of chewing gum.\n\nAs I shook her, my hand crossed a cobweb.\n\nCobwebs seem to be a feature of our luminous body. Some of them are energetically connected to specific spots on our body.\n\nSo if you \u201cfeel\u201d one in the air, it can produce a corresponding sensation on a specific place on the skin.\n\nBut don\u2019t assume it\u2019s connected to that exact spot.\n\nA connection to a power vortex might feel like a connection to the skin, simply because we don\u2019t know the \u201cdoings\u201d of vortexes.\n\nWe know the \u201cdoings\u201d of itchy skin.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what I felt. One fiber connected to the side of my stomach. Another to my right knee. I could move my hand back and forth a few inches in the air, and tickle either one. It felt like a real touch, like a spider crawling there.\n\nIn fact, it was so strong I made sure. Nope. No spiders.\n\nThere were many such fibers in that area of space, but I only remember those two.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to remember everything which happens, once the assemblage point moves below the waist.\n\nWhile feeling those cobwebs, I verified what I\u2019d known for a while. The little hairs on the back of the smaller fingers on the right hand, are very sensitive to touch.\n\nAnd so is the outside edge of the arm, just below the wrist.\n\nMy theory is, that\u2019s for crawling around in narrow caves, so you don\u2019t rip your skin off.\n\nThe little hairs can feel the granite walls well before the skin touches it.\n\nSo those are \u201ccenters of feeling\u201d, and work just as well for feeling the second attention.\n\nI gently wiggled the last 3 fingers on my right hand, next to a cobweb.\n\nThe wiggling was very slow, and very shallow. They barely moved.\n\nAnd yet, they could feel the cobweb as strongly as before.\n\nThat rules out the actual hairs being blown by the air, and making me believe I had felt something.\n\nI really did feel a cobweb!\n\nI suddenly realized what Fancy was doing. She was encouraging me to pay attention to feelings, and not just sight.\n\nBoth seeing, and feeling, are points on the 8 point diagram don Juan drew in the ashes.\n\nNot being a touchy-feely sort of person, I\u2019d ignored the feeling part.\n\nBut the witches, Taisha and Florinda, often talk in terms of pressures or feelings.\n\nI thought it was just a female point of view, but it occurred to me at that point, it might be a more advanced point of view.\n\nIn fact, La Gorda told Carlos, you stop seeing the allies as beings, once you lose the human form. They become lights, or pressures, or something equally disappointing.\n\nWhy would you want to lose your demon fairy in exchange for a \u201cpressure\u201d?\n\nSounds horrible.\n\nFancy spent the next 2 hours teaching me, rapidly. At one point I felt a little panicked. She was pushing me around like an angry school teacher.\n\nThe fright became more real, as I realized I was in uncharted territory with this \u201cfeeling\u201d thing. Maybe Fancy had figured out I was immune to visual kidnapping, and so had devised a scheme to confuse me with feelings, and then toss me into her ice cave.\n\nBut then I realized, so what?\n\nShe\u2019s fun to watch. I watched her more closely, and the fear went away.\n\nFancy did an imitation of \u201cPretty Woman\u201d in the bathtub, except she was riding a rainbow of colored ribbon, rippling through the puffs of light. I can\u2019t possibly depict what she was swimming in, but each color had a feeling in it. And she was wallowing in that.\n\nShe wanted me to see how to relax in the second attention. Just take a nice bubble bath in colors!\n\nMy elbow got scratchy.\n\nIt\u2019s been very hot here, and Cholita won\u2019t give me access to the air conditioner. It\u2019s in her 85% of the house. My 15% is hot. And with the windows covered over for dark room practice, there\u2019s not much that can be done about it, but blow on myself with a giant fan.\n\nThat gave me a heat rash on the arm facing the fan.\n\nBut it turned out to be a good thing. Thanks again Cholita!\n\nShe\u2019s always helpful.\n\nI gently scratched my elbow, to see if all the scabs were gone.\n\nAn intense blue dot lit up on the back of my hand.\n\nI tried it again, scratching gently up and down my arm.\n\nAll I could think was, someone else in this subreddit has to try this out!\n\nScratching did in fact reliably produce lights on my hand.\n\nBut, it wore out. I was only able to generate lights for around 10 seconds, and then nothing.\n\nI took my scratchy hand and waved it gently in the air, to see if any lights were now stuck to it.\n\nThere weren\u2019t, but I felt a patch of air \u201cas thick as water\u201d, as Zuleica had phrased it.\n\nThe air had a \u201cfeeling disturbance\u201d, when the back of my hand passed through.\n\nA dreaming scene started to materialize in front of the disturbance.  By feeling alone, I had summoned a visual sight.\n\nI don\u2019t recall what it was. In fact, I got dragged into that dream, and wasn\u2019t bounced out for quite some time.\n\nAnd now the memory is gone.\n\nIt was blue, and very bright, and the sky was perfect.\n\nThat's about all I remember.\n\nI went to sit on the bed and wiggle my fingers where Zuleica had told us to wiggle them.\n\nI thought, maybe with my super feeling hand, I could finish her technique and get my second attention energy body to take over.\n\nI could indeed feel what Zuleica had described. There as a rope-like thing in the air, which was as thick as water. I could feeling it on my hand and fingers.\n\nThe feeling cast me down into absolute silence. The silence was so profound, I felt as if I\u2019d been tossed into a hole.\n\nThat\u2019s when I noticed an amazing pool of \u201cfeelings\u201d, just to the left of the wiggling fingers.\n\nI didn\u2019t dare turn my head, so I simply \u201cfelt\u201d in there.\n\nI was swimming in orange red happiness. It was so intense, it reminded me of meditation people claiming someone was \u201cstuck in the honeypot\u201d, and not making progress in meditation.\n\nWhat???\n\nIf you hear that nonsense, dump the guru and leave on the spot.\n\nHe\u2019s trying to hold you back.\n\nStrange sensations and sights are the VERY THING you MUST pay attention to in meditation.\n\nOtherwise you'll never reach enlightenment.  Enlightenment = magic.\n\nThere's no other way about it.  No magic, you are NOT enlightened.\n\nGo ask Daniel Ingram if you don't believe me.   A dzogchen master.\n\nOr ShinZen Young, a Taiwanese Zen master.\n\nBut the honeypot of Hindu Samadhi bliss is NOTHING compared to second attention feelings.\n\nI was tossed around side to side, swimming in reddish orange candy feelings.\n\nI passed into a blue zone, and an entirely different but equally pleasurable sensation over took me.\n\nI put my feet on the ground, and leaped out of that pool.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to get stuck in there.\n\nIt was just too much.\n\nIt reminded me of a good massage which lasts far too long.\n\nI got up and turned on the lights and told Fancy, \u201cThat\u2019s enough for tonight!\u201d\n\nEdited twice\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title":

At one point I felt a little panicked. She was pushing me around like an angry school teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fright became more real, as I realized I was in uncharted territory with this \u201cfeeling\u201d thing. Maybe Fancy had figured out I was immune to visual kidnapping, and so had devised a scheme to confuse me with feelings, and then toss me into her ice cave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I realized, so what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She\u2019s fun to watch. I watched her more closely, and the fear went away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fancy did an imitation of \u201cPretty Woman\u201d in the bathtub, except she was riding a rainbow of colored ribbon, rippling through the puffs of light. I can\u2019t possibly depict what she was swimming in, but each color had a feeling in it. And she was wallowing in that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wanted me to see how to relax in the second attention. Just take a nice bubble bath in colors!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My elbow got scratchy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s been very hot here, and Cholita won\u2019t give me access to the air conditioner. It\u2019s in her 85% of the house. My 15% is hot. And with the windows covered over for dark room practice, there\u2019s not much that can be done about it, but blow on myself with a giant fan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gave me a heat rash on the arm facing the fan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it turned out to be a good thing. Thanks again Cholita!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She\u2019s always helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gently scratched my elbow, to see if all the scabs were gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An intense blue dot lit up on the back of my hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried it again, scratching gently up and down my arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I could think was, someone else in this subreddit has to try this out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scratching did in fact reliably produce lights on my hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, it wore out. I was only able to generate lights for around 10 seconds, and then nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took my scratchy hand and waved it gently in the air, to see if any lights were now stuck to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There weren\u2019t, but I felt a patch of air \u201cas thick as water\u201d, as Zuleica had phrased it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The air had a \u201cfeeling disturbance\u201d, when the back of my hand passed through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A dreaming scene started to materialize in front of the disturbance.  By feeling alone, I had summoned a visual sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t recall what it was. In fact, I got dragged into that dream, and wasn\u2019t bounced out for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now the memory is gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was blue, and very bright, and the sky was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s about all I remember.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to sit on the bed and wiggle my fingers where Zuleica had told us to wiggle them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought, maybe with my super feeling hand, I could finish her technique and get my second attention energy body to take over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could indeed feel what Zuleica had described. There as a rope-like thing in the air, which was as thick as water. I could feeling it on my hand and fingers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The feeling cast me down into absolute silence. The silence was so profound, I felt as if I\u2019d been tossed into a hole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s when I noticed an amazing pool of \u201cfeelings\u201d, just to the left of the wiggling fingers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t dare turn my head, so I simply \u201cfelt\u201d in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was swimming in orange red happiness. It was so intense, it reminded me of meditation people claiming someone was \u201cstuck in the honeypot\u201d, and not making progress in meditation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What???&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you hear that nonsense, dump the guru and leave on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s trying to hold you back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Strange sensations and sights are the VERY THING you MUST pay attention to in meditation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise you&amp;#39;ll never reach enlightenment.  Enlightenment = magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no other way about it.  No magic, you are NOT enlightened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go ask Daniel Ingram if you don&amp;#39;t believe me.   A dzogchen master.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or ShinZen Young, a Taiwanese Zen master.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the honeypot of Hindu Samadhi bliss is NOTHING compared to second attention feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was tossed around side to side, swimming in reddish orange candy feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I passed into a blue zone, and an entirely different but equally pleasurable sensation over took me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put my feet on the ground, and leaped out of that pool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t want to get stuck in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was just too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It reminded me of a good massage which lasts far too long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up and turned on the lights and told Fancy, \u201cThat\u2019s enough for tonight!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited twice&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "acff1442-e63e-11ea-b305-0e375464469b", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "ijgd33", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 23, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/ijgd33/feelings_in_the_second_attention/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/ijgd33/feelings_in_the_second_attention/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1598807690.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g3ea9gt", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g3e2jeg", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That's an excellent representation!\n\nI'll add that a puzzling thing is, the fibers (emanations) are supposed to be straight.\n\nWhen *seen* after stopping the world, they are.\n\nBut the fibers you can see in darkness, of any variety, are mostly not straight.\n\nSo there are fine details Carlos didn't explain.\n\nI believe don Juan says that our luminous shell's fibers are all twisted and bent, until we clean our awareness.\n\nBut how can that be?\n\nAnd yet, you can see it with your own eyes.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_g3ea9gt", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s an excellent representation!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll add that a puzzling thing is, the fibers (emanations) are supposed to be straight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt;

Happened a few hours before Fancy decided to teach me about that topic.  It makes me a little suspicious. Fairy reported back to me on what people were doing a couple of times.\n\nMaybe Fairy and Fancy talk about me behind my back.  You guys know how bad that can be, when old girlfriends get together, and gossip about you.\n\nHere's that experience:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI don't know if it was the tensegrity passes that I did during daytime or something else that brought me a lot of energy, but I felt SO full of energy when I started practicing.\n\nIt was not hard to force silence, I didn't have things to think about and I could remind myself to be silent very often without forgetting it. Which was surprising! And it felt very good.\n\nI didn't feel tired at first either, but as I started to gaze at the lights and shapes (I think I see the same spider web-form that was in your drawing!!) I started also feeling tired.\n\nA thing I want to mention is that I have noticed almost every single night when practicing as I have sat in the darkness for some time, I instantly remember the dream I had night before and the feelings I had in it. This is pretty crazy to me bc I have not remembered these dreams when I have woken up or during daytime. So I suspect, could it be the assemblage point moving to the same spot it was the night before where I had the dream?\n\nWell, anyway. After thinking about that I forced silence harder, and started feeling even more sleepy/almost like in a coma, and my head started falling over. In that \"sleepy\" state I started doing Fairy's pass, and not long after I saw the female face, glowing right in front of me !!\n\nThe size of it was like an actual human head size. I got chills and concentrated harder, and it appeared again. Then sleepy feeling again.\n\nAnd THEN!!! Out of nowhere, my whole physical feeling changed. Instantly I got extremely awake, breathing automated, and it is hard to explain, but it felt like I did not feel my body at all.\n\nKinda like I wasn't in my body, and it increased when I looked around in the darkness, experiencing it as if I was floating in it. It reminded me so much of the physical feeling I had in the \"enlightenment\" feeling, but this one was different in the way that I didn't really feel bliss, it was more like a little nauseous uncomfortable feeling.\n\nI got chills, and also became suddenly very hot, sweaty. (And it is cold in my room!!) I don't think I can explain with words well enough how it felt, but it was such an extreme drastic change that I got a little scared.\n\nThe floating away feeling, with this hot and feverish feeling on my body at the same time was enough to remind me how real everything is and also how SCARY it can feel when the assemblage point moves.\n\nI had forgotten about the feeling of fear bc for the past few nights i had only played with the colors. Now the colors got brighter and I tried scooping them, and looking around and then I guess I got too excited when I realized what had happened that it started going away. I can't seem to hold the assemblage point in the spot \ud83d\ude2d How do you do that?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI can't hold the assemblage point anywhere but at the very end of the J curve, because it has nowhere to go from there.\n\nI suspect, learning to hold it at any given position on the J curve is very advanced.  Even, \"stalking\".\n\nThe feeling of floating away happens to me when Cholita appears in her luminous body and I can see the fibers and tentacles.\n\nMaybe you were feeling your energy body.  And yes, it scares me totally when Cholita does that.\n\n Imagine an angry witch dressed sexy in black, suddenly turning into a grey whorl of fibers of darkness, fluttering in the air.\n\nYou're thinking, RUN,  Cholita's gone over the edge!!!!\n\nExcept that you are floating away into the air.

Happened a few hours before Fancy decided to teach me about that topic.  It makes me a little suspicious. Fairy reported back to me on what people were doing a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe Fairy and Fancy talk about me behind my back.  You guys know how bad that can be, when old girlfriends get together, and gossip about you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s that experience:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if it was the tensegrity passes that I did during daytime or something else that brought me a lot of energy, but I felt SO full of energy when I started practicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was not hard to force silence, I didn&amp;#39;t have things to think about and I could remind myself to be silent very often without forgetting it. Which was surprising! And it felt very good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t feel tired at first either, but as I started to gaze at the lights and shapes (I think I see the same spider web-form that was in your drawing!!) I started also feeling tired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A thing I want to mention is that I have noticed almost every single night when practicing as I have sat in the darkness for some time, I instantly remember the dream I had night before and the feelings I had in it. This is pretty crazy to me bc I have not remembered these dreams when I have woken up or during daytime. So I suspect, could it be the assemblage point moving to the same spot it was the night before where I had the dream?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, anyway. After thinking about that I forced silence harder, and started feeling even more sleepy/almost like in a coma, and my head started falling over. In that &amp;quot;sleepy&amp;quot; state I started doing Fairy&amp;#39;s pass, and not long after I saw the female face, glowing right in front of me !!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The size of it was like an actual human head size. I got chills and concentrated harder, and it appeared again. Then sleepy feeling again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And THEN!!! Out of nowhere, my whole physical feeling changed. Instantly I got extremely awake, breathing automated, and it is hard to explain, but it felt like I did not feel my body at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kinda like I wasn&amp;#39;t in my body, and it increased when I looked around in the darkness, experiencing it as if I was floating in it. It reminded me so much of the physical feeling I had in the &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot; feeling, but this one was different in the way that I didn&amp;#39;t really feel bliss, it was more like a little nauseous uncomfortable feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got chills, and also became suddenly very hot, sweaty. (And it is cold in my room!!) I don&amp;#39;t think I can explain with words well enough how it felt, but it was such an extreme drastic change that I got a little scared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The floating away feeling, with this hot and feverish feeling on my body at the same time was enough to remind me how real everything is and also how SCARY it can feel when the assemblage point moves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had forgotten about the feeling of fear bc for the past few nights i had only played with the colors. Now the colors got brighter and I tried scooping them, and looking around and then I guess I got too excited when I realized what had happened that it started going away. I can&amp;#39;t seem to hold the assemblage point in the spot \ud83d\ude2d How do you do that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t hold the assemblage point anywhere but at the very end of the J curve, because it has nowhere to go from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect, learning to hold it at any given position on the J curve is very advanced.  Even, &amp;quot;stalking&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The feeling of floating away happens to me when Cholita appears in her luminous body and I can see the fibers and tentacles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you were feeling your energy body.  And yes, it scares me totally when Cholita does that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine an angry witch dressed sexy in black, suddenly turning into a grey whorl of fibers of darkness, fluttering in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re thinking, RUN,  Cholita&amp;#39;s gone over the edge!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except that you are floating away into the air.  And you feel like throwing up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you just meekly put up with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what I advise you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just swallow the spoonful of bitter medicine.  You have no choice, if you want to become a master of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, that sounds like Fairy to me!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m the one who shrunk her.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose Juann has blown her up again, like a doll.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And didn&amp;#39;t JD get a look at her?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s all mixed up at this point.

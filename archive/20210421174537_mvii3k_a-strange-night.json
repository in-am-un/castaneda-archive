Just remember \\\\\"Hell\\\\\" is a lot cooler, and the new inorganic being is a lot less angry.](https://preview.redd.it/5km6kisg0ku61.png?width=804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9b1d25feae86a2dc654c67e700782cc74d912c6)\n\nI had a very strange night.\n\nI've learned to \"redeploy\" the puffs of color dispersed inside the luminous shell, closer to my torso.\n\nWhen you scoop enough of them there using your hands, you can finish the process by gazing into them.\n\nIt forms a \"thick\" shell of light around your torso, maybe a half foot to a foot away.\n\nIt's difficult to see the edges, because they usually blend into the rest of the cocoon, like thick fog at that point, slowly getting thinner.\n\nIf you gaze into the room toward the outer edges of the cocoon, you can often find a puff or detail hanging in the air, about half way.  Even a couple of sparkling dots, as vague as they can be, is sufficient to form something real.\n\nThose you can turn into things using your gaze, and silence. Or even open them up as a portal and Zip in.\n\nBut when you gaze at the concentrated light near to the torso, which eventually becomes your \"energy body\", it's so thick in there it's like trying to pick a colorful green ball with a picture on it, out of a \"ball pit\" for children.\n\nAfter diving in there yourself, and putting your head below the surface.\n\nSomewhere in there IOBs go nuts, and instead of playing hide and seek they're simply right with you, watching what you are doing.\n\nOne time I saw Fancy, and realized she was hanging out right where the energy body's assemblage point is supposed to be.\n\nShe was moving around in circles there, and pushing against it.\n\nAt the time, you don't \"get it\".  It's such a bizarre thing, you don't just look and think, \"She's trying to push it in and form that dent Zuleica was after.\"\n\nTypically it's a lot later that you realize what was going on.  Especially with IOBs.\n\nA few days ago, I figured it out perhaps 30 minutes later.\n\nI realized it and took my palm and started \"tapping\" on the spot.  I thought I could push the dent in there myself, because Carol Tiggs had said that was possible at a workshop.\n\nI didn't have any luck, but I saw a potential new inorganic being in there.\n\nIt's like a thick mush of pastel colors in that \"inner shell\", and if you gaze at a boundary in the middle of it,  the air sort of clears and you can find a little head in there, looking at you.\n\nOf course the reality is, they're a \"pressure\" projected from elsewhere.  At least, according to don Juan and La Gorda.\n\nWhy we turn that into a \"being\" is beyond me, but I sort of prefer it, to feeling a \"pressure\".\n\nI've seen that new IOB a few times over the last weeks.  Usually he was swirling down between my crossed legs while I sat up on pillows, and tried to finish the finger wiggling technique.\n\nBut last night he seems to have taken over.  With Fancy's permission I might add.\n\nI was sleeping, waiting for a good time to start practicing, and I opened my eyes to see if the room was still perfectly dark.\n\nLately I get lucky, and the purple is already swirling around.\n\nIf I hurry, I can continue to make use of that initial color bonanza.\n\nBut if I move around too much it clears out (my assemblage point moves away from that favorable spot it drifted to while asleep), and it all fades. I have to start over with scooping, to get the colors back.\n\nBut this time, the purple swirls and other normal colors had been replaced by little checkerboard patterns.  Red and white tiny squares were firmly stuck together, covering the room like bedspreads floating in the air. Except they had taken on the same shapes, as the normal purple puffs and streaks would have.\n\nIt sort of reminded me of waking up too fast at night, and the room is covered with bizarre dots of color, buzzing above your head.\n\nDon Juan implied that's damage caused by your gap having been opened a bit, but then it rapidly closes.  I can't recall what he said could cause that.\n\nI sat up to try to figure out if the checkerboard puffs would soon change to a nice smooth purple, but they didn't.\n\nLooking around the room, everything had a solid pattern on it.\n\nIt was like looking in a fabric store, where someone had opened up the patterned fabrics and tossed them all over the area.\n\nI tried scooping some onto my torso, but I couldn't figure out where what I had scooped ended, and the room in general began.\n\nI'd been pulled down into it, like being pulled into a peat bog.\n\nAfter a few attempts to scoop energy onto my torso, and not being able to tell if any had remained, I looked up.\n\nThere at face level was the new inorganic being, grown to twice the normal size of a human's head.\n\nHe was staring at me.  Behind him was hell.\n\nThere was no other way to describe it.  The colors, the intensity,  with nothing in sight but intense weird flames, was a perfect representation of what you might imagine for hell.\n\nThe flames however, were smooth.  They had perfectly straight lines defining their edges.\n\nIn the middle was the floating inorganic being head.\n\nLooking closer I realized that the \"flames\" were actually geometric shapes, like crystals, growing vertically.  They reminded me of the description don Juan had given for what the inorganic beings really look like in their own energy based bodies.\n\nThey were transparent, but all of them were the color of fire.  Mixed in were other possible flame colors. Red, blue, orange, yellow.  All super intense.\n\nNo disappointing barely visible dreaming scene there.\n\nI was in hell.  And loving it!\n\nThere was no heat.\n\nThe inorganic being head moved a bit.\n\nI can't recall what part of it moved.  It looked like a question was being asked, but there was no sound.\n\nI said, \"Sure!  Bring me here any time.  I love it.  Here, let me try pushing and pulling on you.\"\n\nI tried, but the head only budged a half inch or so.\n\nIn Fairy's world I could move the inorganic beings in and out as much as 12 feet per movement.\n\nIn Fancy's world, I can move Bob in and out, at least 4 feet.\n\nIt depends on how far away the inside of the cave is. You arm stretches to reach the wall.\n\nBut this inorganic being's world was like a cave overgrown by giant crystals.\n\nThere was no reference to tell how far you could move him.\n\nThat inorganic being was either \"stuck\", or I didn't understand what I was looking at.\n\nI commented, \"Go ahead and show me what you wanted to show me, if that's what you came for. I love to be taught by inorganic beings!\"\n\nIt motioned, and I turned around to look where it had indicated.  The east wall. He had been on the west wall, in Cholita's direction.\n\nThere was a huge piece of embossed paper.\n\nCholita likes a shop where they sell handmade paper from all over the world, and much of it is embossed.  All has amazing patterns in it, and is thick enough to lean against a wall and have it remain straight.  The last time I took Cholita there, Fairy got excited by the paper and was visibly flying around Cholita, like a golf ball sized puff of cigarette smoke held together by glowing yellow lines radiating from the center of it.\n\nIt could be, Cholita was focusing her attention on flat surfaces, similar to sky gazing,or even darkroom gazing. And so Fairy was excited that her second attention was activating.\n\nBut, maybe IOBs like paper?  I can't imagine why.   But there is that practice of making paper spirits for important holidays, in Mexico.\n\nAnd IOBs can push hard enough to make paper do tricks. Possibly you could even make a paper Golem, and they could bring it to life.\n\nThe piece of paper I was looking at was somewhere between green and blue, and very pastel. In the center of the embossed pattern, which would qualify as a \"medallion\" pattern, I saw a dot.  It was part of the pattern, but raised slightly higher than the rest.\n\nI looked to the inorganic being behind me, and it conveyed the idea that this was actually 2 pieces of paper, but one was stuck on top of the other.\n\nHe nudged me somehow, daring me to separate the two.\n\nThe situation had become so abstract, it was impossible to just reach out and grab the sheets and find where they were linked.\n\nI had no arm or hands at that point.\n\nBut I fussed around from all angles, trying to separate the two sheets of embossed paper.\n\nI got a tiny piece to peel away, and saw that in fact it was a pastel green sheet, with a pastel blue sheet stuck to it.\n\nI put all of my efforts into ripping the two apart, all the while with the inorganic being making fun of me with it's impassive stare. It looked like someone being forced to wait too long, for another person to do something that ought to be easy.\n\nAfter 10 minutes it became obvious I couldn't possibly manage to separate the two sheets. I kept getting trapped between any separated folds I could create.\n\nI stopped, turned to look at the IOB (who was still solidly in hell), and smiled.\n\nI'd forgotten to take a look around and see how cool it all was.  How come I could look over at the paper on the east wall, then turn around to the west, and \"hell\" was still perfectly solid and real looking?\n\nTalk about \"directionality\"!  This was the ultimate.  West wall leads to hell, east wall leads to Cholita's favorite paper store.\n\nI was fully awake, eyes open, standing up on one side of my bedroom, and although it was absolutely pitch black in there I could see the room.\n\nOr, \"a room\".  It didn't occur to me to interrogate the room, to make sure it was \"accurate\".\n\nI must have smiled even more on realizing how amazing it was,  which caused the inorganic being to nod his head.\n\nHe seemed to be saying,  \"Lesson one complete.\"\n\nHe slowly turned his head to look around the room.\n\nI copied him.  I didn't try to change anything, I just looked, scanning from south to north, on the east wall.\n\nWhen I came to the center of the paper, I just watched the dot to see if I could understand the pattern.\n\nIf there were 2 sheets of embossed paper, maybe there were actually 2 patterns.\n\nAs I watched, the pieces separated around 3 feet all by themselves, one rotated to re-orient (apparently it was upside down), and boh pieces were now separate and intact, floating in front of me.\n\nYep. Two separate patterns were there.\n\nJust to emphasize how well that worked they both became absolutely flat, just hanging in the air as if they were back on the shelf system at the paper store, for Cholita to inspect.\n\nThe inorganic being spoke to me, but I can't recall any actual voice.\n\nIt said, \"You can't do anything in here.  Why haven't you understood that?\"\n\nIt took me a while to understand what it meant.  At first I understood it to mean, I'm a beggar.\n\nAll I can do is beg. I can't take.\n\nBut then I thought about Silvio Manuel. He was certainly no beggar.\n\nAnd yet, he was the master of intent.  He could get intent to do anything he wanted.\n\nAt which point I compounded the mistake.\n\nI kept looking for something to gaze at, while I \"waited\" for intent to do something with it.\n\nI thought  I had it figured out. You just find what you want, and then wait.\n\n\"Skill\" is always getting what you wanted.\n\nBut still, you didn't do it.\n\nI tried and tried to find something that would simply do what I wanted, and in the end I was covered in hundreds of sheets of embossed paper, nearly unable to stand up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "A Strange Night", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Dreaming"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"5km6kisg0ku61": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 116, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5km6kisg0ku61.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1cc3b4c1f2b49f9d1310e31f99ac97470f85f66"}, {"y": 232, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5km6kisg0ku61.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20d7eac84235c9d605978cd57770dbffe96d58a5"}, {"y": 345, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5km6kisg0ku61.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6a564365d7fefa05d567388331c4240f8cc4942"}, {"y": 690, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5km6kisg0ku61.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8be616343938504e76ec8739ed86b87244ad5c9f"}], "s": {"y": 867, "x": 804, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5km6kisg0ku61.png?width=804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9b1d25feae86a2dc654c67e700782cc74d912c6"}, "id": "5km6kisg0ku61"}}, "name": "t3_mvii3k", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 17, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Dreaming", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 17, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6I5lrOyQN8kPU7f8hzIZycMUpgGrXpSYdQQa_7Eu7kQ.jpg", "edited": 1619029173.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1619019937.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": true, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5km6kisg0ku61.png?width=804&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c9b1d25feae86a2dc654c67e700782cc74d912c6\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what happens when you try to use PC Paint instead of GIMP.

West wall leads to hell, east wall leads to Cholita&amp;#39;s favorite paper store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was fully awake, eyes open, standing up on one side of my bedroom, and although it was absolutely pitch black in there I could see the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or, &amp;quot;a room&amp;quot;.  It didn&amp;#39;t occur to me to interrogate the room, to make sure it was &amp;quot;accurate&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I must have smiled even more on realizing how amazing it was,  which caused the inorganic being to nod his head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He seemed to be saying,  &amp;quot;Lesson one complete.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He slowly turned his head to look around the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I copied him.  I didn&amp;#39;t try to change anything, I just looked, scanning from south to north, on the east wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I came to the center of the paper, I just watched the dot to see if I could understand the pattern.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If there were 2 sheets of embossed paper, maybe there were actually 2 patterns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I watched, the pieces separated around 3 feet all by themselves, one rotated to re-orient (apparently it was upside down), and boh pieces were now separate and intact, floating in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep. Two separate patterns were there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just to emphasize how well that worked they both became absolutely flat, just hanging in the air as if they were back on the shelf system at the paper store, for Cholita to inspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The inorganic being spoke to me, but I can&amp;#39;t recall any actual voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It said, &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t do anything in here.  Why haven&amp;#39;t you understood that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to understand what it meant.  At first I understood it to mean, I&amp;#39;m a beggar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I can do is beg. I can&amp;#39;t take.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I thought about Silvio Manuel. He was certainly no beggar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, he was the master of intent.  He could get intent to do anything he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At which point I compounded the mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept looking for something to gaze at, while I &amp;quot;waited&amp;quot; for intent to do something with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought  I had it figured out. You just find what you want, and then wait.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Skill&amp;quot; is always getting what you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But still, you didn&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried and tried to find something that would simply do what I wanted, and in the end I was covered in hundreds of sheets of embossed paper, nearly unable to stand up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "d442824c-6005-11ea-b1ec-0ebd57ae4429", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#373c3f", "id": "mvii3k", "is_robot_indexable": true, "num_duplicates": 0, "report_reasons": null, "author": "danl999", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 53, "send_replies": true, "media": null, "contest_mode": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mvii3k/a_strange_night/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/comments/mvii3k/a_strange_night/", "subreddit_subscribers": 9561, "created_utc": 1619019937.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "mod_reports": [], "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gvcixwe", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "danl999", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1619026794.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gvcgidz", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "That's the good thing about doing \"the real thing\".\n\nIt's not like doing 2 decades of yoga meditation, and then deciding you were tricked.\n\nOr being an angry Zen lover, consoling yourself with the idea that if you don't make it, you'll be reborn to try again.

And I don&amp;#39;t believe they can reform, though others in here think it&amp;#39;s possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s universally agreed, even outside this subreddit, that learning to be silent is nearly impossible, and the hardest thing anyone will every do in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the result is &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot;, and magic floating in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you read the &amp;quot;Bad Player&amp;quot; link on the right?  You&amp;#39;re not behaving like one, so I can talk  honestly to you. But you do  have some of their pretending tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bad players want to be sorcerers but they don&amp;#39;t want to do any work. And they want attention from others, as if the other people actually believe they are sorcerers when they are not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They often fixate on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you read it, you&amp;#39;ll see nearly all of the bad tendencies people pick up, which make it impossible to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe we&amp;#39;re up to 11 different types.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read it, you can avoid all of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is NOT like yoga,k buddhism, Daoism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I consider all of those to be mostly phony these days.  Certainly no one I know of , or that our 2500 members can find on the net, can do what is being done in here in terms of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you may be thinking it&amp;#39;s casual, like joining a yoga chat group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we have a purpose in there, and that&amp;#39;s to teach real, impossible magic to as many as possible, and to try to keep the bad players from taking over, which would destroy our goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_mvii3k", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mvii3k/a_strange_night/gvtm0hb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1619362090.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1619362090.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gvq9dfx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Bornassfirst01", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gvq2son", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_77hk2yex", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Silent ok .

I get lots of those.\n\nWe have what's called an \"assemblage point\". It's an area of extra glow, when you look at the \"aura\" of a human.\n\nI hate to use that word aura, because usually when someone uses that, they're completely insane and pretending.\n\nBut in fact, humans glow. And it's easier to see in the dark.\n\nThis glowing point determines the world you live in.\n\nIf you move it, the world changes.\n\nSometimes it moves so far, you can actually go live somewhere else for hours, or even weeks.\n\nSo if you want to learn sorcery and have magic in your life, you need to move it.\n\nPower plants (shrooms) force it to move, without all the hard work.\n\nBut they push it sideways.  We want it to move downwards, in the middle.  Here's the J curve diagram.  And what happens as it moves:\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3](https://preview.redd.it/9zmf1q8wiyt61.jpg?width=3592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c504315daee4786aca6ea85c015b79e085c234a3)\n\nThose pictures are not things we read in a book, or that we got from a \"Guru\".  In fact, even the Buddha didn't do all that.\n\nThose are just what I did since I arrived here, and started making pictures.  I couldn't afford to draw all those, so I took them from the posts of the last year.\n\nThat's what you want to do.  Those things. They lead all the way to the end, where you simply, \"know whatever you want to know\".\n\nAt that point you don't need a teacher.\n\nBut, halfway down the start of the curve (railroad tracks) where you see \"little red riding hood\" offering to teach \"Sliding Dreaming\", you get command of a spirit.\n\nAnd she will teach you. They just tend to teach you things that help them, more than you.\n\nIf you use power plants like mushrooms, they can push you that far down.\n\nLet's say, to just below little red riding hood.\n\nBut they will not push you past that wall you see at the bottom. You'll never make it back up the other side.\n\nAnd, they burn \"grooves\" into the path your assemblage point moves. They ruin you for learning sorcery the permanent way. And make you kind of weird so that everyone wants to avoid you.\n\nAlso, if you have read the books, you seem to have misunderstood them greatly.\n\nDo you see the little Fairy standing on my hand, near the green line on the right?\n\nTHAT'S \"Little Smoke\".\n\nLittle Smoke is not the smoking mixture. It's her.  A fairy.  A spirit.\n\nOr a demon.\n\nYou need one of those to duplicate the cool stuff in the early books.\n\nThe drugs were just used to loosen the assemblage point of Carlos.\n\nBut the talking lizards were \"Minx\", now controlled by my witch friend Cholita, and the stuff that happened by smoking the mushroom mixture, was from Fairy.\n\nShe's now with Juann.\n\nTo move your assemblage point without the drugs, you need to get that voice out of your mind.\n\nThe endless dialogue that never gives you a minute of peace.\n\nIt's 100% focused on this reality. On your problems, worries, and so on.\n\nAll of those are at the top of that J curve picture. As long as those are in your mind, your assemblage point can't move.\n\nOnce you get rid of that talking voice, your assemblage point can move.\n\nWe use puffs of color in the dark, to move it.  And then we use all of the cool things you see as it moves down, to move it further.\n\nAnother way to move it is with \"stalking\".\n\nStalking is behaving in a manner in which you normally don't behave.\n\nSo it alters that voice in  your head.\n\nIf you pretend to be an entirely different person, and \"live it\" a bit, that internal dialogue is stirred up very strongly, and can't obsess as much.\n\nBut you still have to shut it off, to get real magic to happen.\n\nPeople like to pretend to be doing that, because shutting off the internal dialogue is too hard, and pretending to be doing stalking is easy.\n\nBut no one has ever learned sorcery that way, at least not since Carlos wrote his books.\n\n\"Stalking with intent\" could mean anything.\n\nWhen the assemblage point moves, the world changes.\n\nIt can get really weird.\n\nTo hold it at a new position, you need to retain that reality. That position of the assemblage point.\n\nYou can focus on something only over there, and that helps hold the \"intent\" of that world.\n\nOur world is actually created by \"intent\".\n\nSo \"stalking with *intent*\" could mean, using the power of *intent*, to alter yourself for the purpose of stalking.\n\nOr it could mean, trying to hold an unusual position of the assemblage point, such as heightened awareness.\n\nThat's past the wall in the picture, at the bottom right.\n\nIt's hard to maintain that position of the assemblage point.\n\nSo people use \"stalking\" to keep it there.\n\nFor Taisha, that meant climbing into a tree house, where there were spirits like \"Little Smoke\" living.  In the tree.\n\nTree Pixies, some call them.\n\nWhile she was up there with them, they helped her hold her assemblage point in the \"orange zone\", past that sign on the railroad tracks.\n\nI fear you've decided this is a path to use drugs to learn magic.\n\nIt is not.\n\nThe magic came from that inorganic being,  named \"little smoke\" by don Juan.\n\nProbably because when she flies around in daylight, she looks like a golf ball sized puff of smoke, with glowing fibers of light radiating from the center.\n\nMy witch friend Cholita used to get her to move objects.\n\nCholita would look at something, I'd see a little puff of smoke fly over to it, and go under something, it would bump up into the air an inch or two, and then Cholita could move it with her eyes.\n\nBut Little Smoke was known to make water coolers burp, to emphasize a point Carlos was making in private classes.\n\nAnd she even takes on full sized female form. \n\nShe's quite lovely!  And not shy.\n\nYou won't be able to make mushrooms do what you read in the books.\n\nYou need the spirits.\n\nAnd the people out there who will try to pretend they could help you with that, are all mentally ill.\n\nPeople even charge money to pretend to teach what you want.\n\nThen, once you're drugged up, god only knows what they really want.\n\nThey often call themselves, \"Benefactors\".\n\nStay away from anyone who uses that word. If they claim to be a benefactor, or ever had one, they are mentally ill.\n\nOr really stupid.\n\nIf you want to duplicate the early books, learn darkroom gazing and then try \"Fairy's Pass\".\n\nLittle Smoke created it.\n\nShe told me she'd visit people who did that, because she can detect the energy.\n\nJuan has her often.\n\nBut I'm confident she'll help anyone who makes a serious effort.\n\nShe's helping Carlos out. To try to teach people sorcery.\n\nBut if Little Smoke doesn't show up, there are other spirits.\n\nI have 3 new ones, not mentioned in the books.\n\nGot them myself with darkroom gazing.\n\nWe're allowed 3.\n\nI don't believe you can have more, but Carlos didn't tell us what the limit was.\n\nDon Juan only had 2.", "edited": 1619290809.0, "gildings": {}, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gvqjvpo", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no drugs used in the sorcery in this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you use power plants, you will never actually learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll bend and twist you, and you&amp;#39;ll be incapable of finding the motivation to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it seems like you&amp;#39;re new, so I&amp;#39;m going to explain stalking to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was worried you were on a weird ego trip.

That position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can focus on something only over there, and that helps hold the &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; of that world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our world is actually created by &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So &amp;quot;stalking with &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; could mean, using the power of &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt;, to alter yourself for the purpose of stalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or it could mean, trying to hold an unusual position of the assemblage point, such as heightened awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s past the wall in the picture, at the bottom right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to maintain that position of the assemblage point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So people use &amp;quot;stalking&amp;quot; to keep it there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Taisha, that meant climbing into a tree house, where there were spirits like &amp;quot;Little Smoke&amp;quot; living.  In the tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tree Pixies, some call them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While she was up there with them, they helped her hold her assemblage point in the &amp;quot;orange zone&amp;quot;, past that sign on the railroad tracks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fear you&amp;#39;ve decided this is a path to use drugs to learn magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The magic came from that inorganic being,  named &amp;quot;little smoke&amp;quot; by don Juan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably because when she flies around in daylight, she looks like a golf ball sized puff of smoke, with glowing fibers of light radiating from the center.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My witch friend Cholita used to get her to move objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita would look at something, I&amp;#39;d see a little puff of smoke fly over to it, and go under something, it would bump up into the air an inch or two, and then Cholita could move it with her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Little Smoke was known to make water coolers burp, to emphasize a point Carlos was making in private classes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she even takes on full sized female form. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s quite lovely!  And not shy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t be able to make mushrooms do what you read in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You need the spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the people out there who will try to pretend they could help you with that, are all mentally ill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People even charge money to pretend to teach what you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, once you&amp;#39;re drugged up, god only knows what they really want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They often call themselves, &amp;quot;Benefactors&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stay away from anyone who uses that word. If they claim to be a benefactor, or ever had one, they are mentally ill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or really stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to duplicate the early books, learn darkroom gazing and then try &amp;quot;Fairy&amp;#39;s Pass&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little Smoke created it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She told me she&amp;#39;d visit people who did that, because she can detect the energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Juan has her often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m confident she&amp;#39;ll help anyone who makes a serious effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s helping Carlos out. To try to teach people sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if Little Smoke doesn&amp;#39;t show up, there are other spirits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have 3 new ones, not mentioned in the books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got them myself with darkroom gazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re allowed 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe you can have more, but Carlos didn&amp;#39;t tell us what the limit was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don Juan only had 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_mvii3k",

Maybe 50?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone believe you can smoke that pipe, and not get entirely stoned?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I belive you think that will summon the ally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was just an example of how nutty the old &amp;quot;Men of KNowledge&amp;quot; would get in their sorcery antics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inventory obsessed they were.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos summoned little smoke in private classes a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He simply pointed to where she was in the room, and she swooped by us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same as don Juan did at the campfire for Carlos.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_mvii3k", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/mvii3k/a_strange_night/gvtmvxy/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1619362534.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1619362534.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gvud26t", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Bornassfirst01", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1619375052.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gvucga2", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_77hk2yex", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I\u2019m not going to .

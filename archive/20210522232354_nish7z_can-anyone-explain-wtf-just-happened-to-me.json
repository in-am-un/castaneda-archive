It's one of the bad player things.  They collect single incidents they can portray as sorcery success, and spread them around on social media, so that they get what they really want: Attention from other people.\n\nAs a result, they will never learn sorcery.\n\nWe had one visit here recently. Posted a weird dream to get attention, everyone was polite, but then in private chat it turned out they had a series of things like that. Their \"claims to fame\", and their goal was actually to come share them here.  Not to learn sorcery.\n\nThey simply realized they'd get their butt kicked, but they were still saving their claims for when they figured out how to introduce them freely.\n\nIt was my famous \"book deal mind\", but a variety I didn't notice before.\n\nA \"book deal tour\".\n\nWe get lots of those in here! I don't understand why I didn't notice it before.\n\nI suspect that person had gone elsewhere before, and gotten beat up.\n\nNot saying you did that.  You actually had some interesting phenomena there, going back and forth with a slight assemblage point movement.\n\nWorthy of a question.\n\nBut the details of the dream are not. Those only become worthy when you can repeat the same dream on demand.\n\nAlso, be careful with the highly polluted topics such as Astral Travel, OBE, and Magick.\n\nThose are unprotected territories. So like Castaneda style sorcery in the pretending community out there (not in the real thing), they're filled to the brink with exaggerations and false claims.\n\nAnd they have no reliable policing there, to fight off the nonsense.\n\nSo they seem like \"systems\" with rational steps you can take to learn them.\n\nBut they're really just 99% book deal mind, with 1% interesting effect that doesn't mean what they believe at all.\n\nThat's all mixed with extremely bad \"teaching\" advice from male bullies, which would prevent learning sorcery if taken to heart.\n\nIt's the lack of policing that draws people in.\n\nFirst, because they know they can share their experience, and no one will call them out on it if it's nonsense.\n\nBut more importantly, because they seem like complete \"systems\" or topics.  They seem well known. Balanced.  Ancient even.\n\nSo people get pissed off, if you point out the obvious. How dare you? It's a valid, \"system\".\n\nExcept it's not.\n\nI'd like to use an example someone mentioned to me yesterday, in seriousness.\n\nBut it'll hurt someone's feelings, and new people don't deserve that for honest mistakes.\n\nI'll make up a story.\n\nThere are some indigenous natives on the Island of Taiwan.\n\nThey're famous for selling their daughters for marriage to invading Europeans.\n\nAnd for getting drunk.

It&amp;#39;s one of the bad player things.  They collect single incidents they can portray as sorcery success, and spread them around on social media, so that they get what they really want: Attention from other people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, they will never learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had one visit here recently. Posted a weird dream to get attention, everyone was polite, but then in private chat it turned out they had a series of things like that. Their &amp;quot;claims to fame&amp;quot;, and their goal was actually to come share them here.  Not to learn sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They simply realized they&amp;#39;d get their butt kicked, but they were still saving their claims for when they figured out how to introduce them freely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was my famous &amp;quot;book deal mind&amp;quot;, but a variety I didn&amp;#39;t notice before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;book deal tour&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We get lots of those in here! I don&amp;#39;t understand why I didn&amp;#39;t notice it before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect that person had gone elsewhere before, and gotten beat up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not saying you did that.  You actually had some interesting phenomena there, going back and forth with a slight assemblage point movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worthy of a question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the details of the dream are not. Those only become worthy when you can repeat the same dream on demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, be careful with the highly polluted topics such as Astral Travel, OBE, and Magick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are unprotected territories. So like Castaneda style sorcery in the pretending community out there (not in the real thing), they&amp;#39;re filled to the brink with exaggerations and false claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they have no reliable policing there, to fight off the nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So they seem like &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot; with rational steps you can take to learn them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;#39;re really just 99% book deal mind, with 1% interesting effect that doesn&amp;#39;t mean what they believe at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all mixed with extremely bad &amp;quot;teaching&amp;quot; advice from male bullies, which would prevent learning sorcery if taken to heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the lack of policing that draws people in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, because they know they can share their experience, and no one will call them out on it if it&amp;#39;s nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, because they seem like complete &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot; or topics.  They seem well known. Balanced.  Ancient even.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So people get pissed off, if you point out the obvious. How dare you? It&amp;#39;s a valid, &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to use an example someone mentioned to me yesterday, in seriousness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;ll hurt someone&amp;#39;s feelings, and new people don&amp;#39;t deserve that for honest mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll make up a story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are some indigenous natives on the Island of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re famous for selling their daughters for marriage to invading Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And for getting drunk.

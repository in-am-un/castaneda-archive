If anyone can add more to it, I'd like you to post it here as a comment, and I'll try to incorporate it.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"As we reviewed don Juan's world, we realized that it was a replica of his benefactor's world. It could be seen as consisting either of groups or households. There was a group of four independent pairs of apparent sisters who worked and lived together; another group of three men who were don Juan's age and were very close to him; a team of two somewhat younger men, the couriers Emilito and Juan Tuma; and finally a team of two younger, southerly women who seemed to be related to each other, Marta and Teresa. At other times it could be seen as consisting of four separate households, located quite far from one another in different areas of Mexico. One was made up of the two westerly women, Zuleica and Zoila, Silvio Manuel, and the courier Marta. The next was composed of the southerly women, Cecilia and Delia, don Juan's courier, Emilito, and the courier Teresa. Another household was formed by the easterly women, Carmela and Hermelinda, Vicente, and the courier Juan Tuma; and the last, of the northerly women, Nelida and Florinda, and don Genaro.\"\n\nBut also, there are passages with more specific information like this one:\n\n\"He took me to a town in central Mexico, to a house in the countryside. As we approached it on foot from a southerly direction, I saw two massive Indian women standing four feet apart, facing each other. They were about thirty or forty feet away from the main door of the house, in an area where the dirt was hard-packed. The two women were extraordinarily muscular and stern. Both had long, jet-black hair held together in a single thick braid. They looked like sisters. They were about the same height and weight - I figured that they must have been around five feet four, and weighed 150 pounds. One of them was extremely dark, almost black, the other much lighter. They were dressed like typical Indian women from central Mexico - long, full dresses and shawls, homemade sandals.\"\n\nAnd, the thing that made me curious:  Emilito is actually Zuleica, and yet lives apart from her household.\n\nIn cases with \"exception information\",  perhaps coming from workshop notes, I'd like the notes.\n\nSuch as:\n\n\"It's in [this interview](https://chaparral.space/wiki/Interview_1993_Abelar,_John_Martinez) with Taisha. Emilito and Zuleica are one and the same?\n\nSo  the stalkers training - which was very, very important in my case  because my assemblage point was erratic - was to explore the  ramifications of a different reality. And in my case it was the realm of  the trees in the tree house. But that tree house existed because other  members of the sorcery group also -- whoever had that same problem,  namely Zuleica, one of Don Juan's cohorts who was really Emilito,  because Emilito was Zuleica's dream body in this other position. So  whoever had the problem of erratic assemblage point movements was  hoisted up in the harness, put in a tree house to learn to stabilize. \"\n\nAlso, someone must have done this before, with all the \"me-too\" businesses out there.  I'd love to get pointers to those on the net.\n\nIf Zuleica could double up, who else could and did?\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Map Project, First Version", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Lineage"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"p3j81et1yge51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p3j81et1yge51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=498ef904d33736a6d00a6e1068372518cded2fc2"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p3j81et1yge51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cea98cee411759756ca51a0d89999414546057aa"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p3j81et1yge51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=264d88794f8e594ce9fafc178089ac45de973da4"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p3j81et1yge51.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efa3c37c890673590376c3943a12cac70e83d3a3"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p3j81et1yge51.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65b3069dcc637349f5a597a6e28a6900cc4b0553"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p3j81et1yge51.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c54c1e92a0b7d0700fdb119dca3a9f3540d4d913"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1920, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p3j81et1yge51.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d26e7dca2684a34dad00f2d76e5b0489772256b"}, "id": "p3j81et1yge51"}}, "name": "t3_gz2n71", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 8, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Lineage", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 8, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9ku4nbKQUVfZM4k9j4k6GDUhLtd13V5sW5zw37SV-ac.jpg", "edited": 1596321583.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1591633999.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/p3j81et1yge51.jpg?width=1920&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2d26e7dca2684a34dad00f2d76e5b0489772256b\"&gt;Anyone know if Carlos wrote about Julian or Elias&amp;#39;s last names?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m making a map of the households and significant places in Carlos&amp;#39; books.

He said that he had established the idea that an ally could not be seen because an ally adopted any form. When I pointed out that he had once also said that Mescalito adopted any form, don Juan dropped the whole conversation, saying that the &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; to which he was referring was not like ordinary &amp;quot;looking at things&amp;quot; and that my confusion stemmed from my insistence on talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null,

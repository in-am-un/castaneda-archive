The Buddha was a \"magic man\", so you ought to believe him.  Then, the chinese scribes added on whatever the hell they wanted, claiming it came from the magic man.  Most of it was designed to enslave people to the temple.\n\nThe Daoists used the \"guy too magical to even be willing to hang out with you\" trick.\n\nThat appeals to a lot of people who have a hard time getting along with others.

They were clearly monk \"book deals\".\n\nAnd it's just 1 or 2.\n\nThe jews not only predicted the future more than 1000 times, never getting a single one wrong, but they still have outstanding prophecies, which are coming true.\n\nThe document was sealed as of 400 BC, so you can find prophecies for time periods past that, and you don't have to trust the historical order of the books which contained already fulfilled prophecies.\n\nBut, they also added, to their prophecies, untrue elements.  Like the whole \"demon\" and \"angel\" thing.\n\nThe entire storyline reads like, \"How agriculture enslaved everyone and allowed the removal of magic from the world\", if you look closely.\n\nAnd yet, the prophets were sorcerers, nearly identical to us. Silence was their technique.\n\nThey came from the same ancient period the Olmecs came from.

Defending it, trying to make it look good for others, trying to hide it&amp;#39;s endless misery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both in this story, are sill obsessed with self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The psychic thing interests me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carlos asked use to &amp;quot;really study&amp;quot; the bible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did.  Obsessively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It caused me to study other religions, to see if any used the same &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot; used by the bible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Buddhists used the trick of &amp;quot;magic man&amp;quot;. The Buddha was a &amp;quot;magic man&amp;quot;, so you ought to believe him.  Then, the chinese scribes added on whatever the hell they wanted, claiming it came from the magic man.  Most of it was designed to enslave people to the temple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Daoists used the &amp;quot;guy too magical to even be willing to hang out with you&amp;quot; trick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That appeals to a lot of people who have a hard time getting along with others.  The people who took it up as a business, added everything they could find from &amp;quot;wise&amp;quot; chinese literature, making it also appeal to the inventory obsessed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kind of like the trick the Hindus used!  These magic guys are so weird, you can&amp;#39;t even follow him.    That appeals to the fashion obsessed, as well as cast outs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the Jews take the cake. I&amp;#39;ve looked everywhere, and can&amp;#39;t find a single example of predicting the future, successfully.  And just to make sure you see that they are doing that, the taunt you in the texts themselves!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Demonstrably so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an account here or there in Buddhist literature which &amp;quot;predicts the future&amp;quot;, but if you look into them the creation of the document post dates the event. They were clearly monk &amp;quot;book deals&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s just 1 or 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The jews not only predicted the future more than 1000 times, never getting a single one wrong, but they still have outstanding prophecies, which are coming true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The document was sealed as of 400 BC, so you can find prophecies for time periods past that, and you don&amp;#39;t have to trust the historical order of the books which contained already fulfilled prophecies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, they also added, to their prophecies, untrue elements.  Like the whole &amp;quot;demon&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;angel&amp;quot; thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entire storyline reads like, &amp;quot;How agriculture enslaved everyone and allowed the removal of magic from the world&amp;quot;, if you look closely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yet, the prophets were sorcerers, nearly identical to us. Silence was their technique.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They came from the same ancient period the Olmecs came from.

Here, it found a guardian inside \\\\\"the wall\\\\\".](https://preview.redd.it/p8pq6z5oavw51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bdc2f870f50a941c74b73e9852f1132947ab85d)\n\nLast night I was trying to learn to enter other worlds directly on my own, without the help of an inorganic being.\n\nI had been gifted by *intent* to see that it\u2019s just a matter of changing over to the dreaming double, rapidly after viewing the world you want to enter.\n\nTaisha\u2019s new book helped me to  understand, or at least summon, that *intent* gift.\n\nBut now, I had to do it on my own.  One gift per customer...\n\nI did Fancy\u2019s Tensegrity move 4 times, and right on que she showed up.  If I want her better formed, I just do a few more passes. Each one is 10 moves.\n\nBut for whatever reason, even when magic is the reward, laziness persists.\n\nI went to sit up on the bed and watch energy on the walls.\n\nI suggest that ought to be the goal of your \u201cpuffery\u201d. To keep it up until you can see energy on the Horizon, so we can follow the advice of Carlos. Clean the link to the spirit. Gain intent as your leader.\n\n\u201cThe Wall\u201d is one of those things you\u2019d overlook, if someone didn\u2019t warn you about it ahead of time.\n\nAt first you simply start to \u201csee the room in the dark\u201d. And you learn that the longer you practice, the more likely that is to occur.\n\nBut in fact you are not seeing the room in the dark. You\u2019re seeing raw (unformed) energy, on any surface in front of you.\n\nThe large flat ones make it the most obvious, but it\u2019ll be all over anything. Even small round objects, or the palm of your hand.\n\nAnd it\u2019s nothing but pure energy.\n\nI\u2019d call it, \u201cour energy\u201d, because there\u2019s also \u201cdark energy\u201d, the kind that the inorganic beings have.\n\nThat\u2019s the \u201cwild card\u201d energy. As you follow the normal kind of energy humans can perceive, the darker stuff pushes the assemblage point into the more obscure realms of human perception.\n\nBut as it turns out, there are other forms of energy.\n\nSuch as \u201cpink energy\u201d.\n\nI got a big dose of that from a man I found inhabiting the space between \u201cthe wall\u201d, and the other side of the wall.\n\nHe was blasting it out. I didn't remember to show that, but picture a circular shock wave in the air, projecting from his head.  Pink energy waves.\n\nAs it turned out, if your gaze is too intense you can tunnel right into the energy you see on the wall, and it expands into it\u2019s own sort of \u201ccrystalline dreaming fog\".\n\nA barrier.\n\nExcept you aren\u2019t lost in it, the way you would be in darkroom gazing at purple light.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cover there\u201d.\n\nBut at first that night, when the energy on the walls became very obvious,  I tried to find the geometric flashes of colored light that show up behind the wall, if you gaze through it like it were a see-through shower door. I don\u2019t know why, but those flashes seem to be geometric forms, for as long as I can remember. I used to ignore them as \u201ceye junk\u201d. But really! A tan rectangle flashes on the wall, with perfectly sharp edges, clearly behind the find lines of energy you see on the wall? And we tend to ignore such things???\n\nThose are exactly what I saw, and nearly ignored.\n\nI suppose that was the first time I realized how silly that was, and gazed through the wall to find more.  What are those things???\n\nI found only one more, before the energy on the wall decided to take form. And an impassable block wall formed in front of me. I could see the details clearly. As clearly as in that picture. In fact, everything there is correct intensity. That\u2019s how it looked. Except for the man. The man I found was likely south American Indian, and much older. I just couldn\u2019t find a suitable \u201cMexican Indian man in pink shirt with smile\u201d on google. So I got a gay Iranian fashion model instead.\n\nBut before I found the man, Fancy pulled a dirty trick on me. I had some left over \u201ccounter intent\u201d from dealing with people who ask questions, and Fancy decided to exploit it. I found myself staring at a list of rules to follow, to neutralize counter intent. I must have been looking at that for a full hour, being pushed back and forth by what can only be called a \u201cpressure\u201d, until the man with the pink outfit burst through, pulled aside the wall, and leaned in to smile at me.\n\nHe was amazing! It\u2019s impossible to describe the feeling of looking at him. I can only think of Carlos\u2019 category of \u201cGuardian\u201d, to describe him. By the way, I suspect Vicente was behind \u201cMescalito\u201d. I hope people keep an eye out for evidence of that. Vicente is possibly more important than we realize.\n\nLooking at the potential guardian I realized, I was not looking through the wall. I was looking inside it.\n\nIn its own way, it was a \u201ccrystalline dreaming wall\u201d.\n\nBut probably, it\u2019s our gaze. When it\u2019s intense, it can get trapped by details and form a barrier.\n\nEven when manipulating \u201cthe wall\u201d, you have to be careful about how sharp your gaze is.\n\nIt\u2019s a sign of intermediate achievement to get trapped that way. Strong gaze, but not enough control.\n\nAfter a few hours, which included Cholita sneaking back home from whereever she fled to, and slamming a few doors to keep me alert, I lay on my side to sleep.\n\nI was in Juan's level of \"annoying heightened awareness\".\n\nJust as my head hit the pillow, laying on my left side, Fancy showed up to thank me for the energy.\n\nOr at least, I hope that's why. She had in fact kept me trapped a full hour.\n\nShe pretended to be about to lay down along side me, except the bed ended before the place she planned to lay.\n\nShe smiled and turned her head, and became intensely real.  Each smile or roll of her eyes caused her hair style and clothes to change, each time more beautiful than the last.\n\nI'd forgotten about Fancy. But she didn't forget about me and what I liked to see best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Thickness of The Wall", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Darkroom Practice"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "collections": [{"permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castaneda/collection/9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "link_ids": ["t3_ifu1bv", "t3_if5koq", "t3_ienqgj", "t3_ie01zd", "t3_idn0fa", "t3_idh7ju", "t3_iczlw5", "t3_icv2ot", "t3_irms6p", "t3_irglig", "t3_iqzit7", "t3_iq7jdg", "t3_iof5ib", "t3_invu3w", "t3_imlozg", "t3_ilzfhg", "t3_ildkri", "t3_ijgd33", "t3_iixdqk", "t3_ihms98", "t3_ih21eh", "t3_ih44uo", "t3_igh7ta", "t3_igday4", "t3_jcxlwj", "t3_hp41du", "t3_kdsew2", "t3_kz7y8a", "t3_kz75ql", "t3_kw4lpr", "t3_kvqj52", "t3_knpzzc", "t3_km2pzf", "t3_kj29l8", "t3_kd0b1h", "t3_k641wo", "t3_k4jrfq", "t3_k2paj7", "t3_k2dn7a", "t3_k1fwwj", "t3_jqlctf", "t3_jq09jk", "t3_jp4g2x", "t3_jng0bx", "t3_jmu5w3", "t3_jmsrw3", "t3_jm1fxl", "t3_jkklgr", "t3_jikxdd", "t3_jhb6f9", "t3_jh8142", "t3_jglh8m", "t3_jgb5mx", "t3_jg53re", "t3_jfoaai", "t3_jf4c1u", "t3_je4gyw", "t3_jdlcth", "t3_jby6ff", "t3_jadwdo", "t3_j9fkih", "t3_j96xwg", "t3_j8rmcm", "t3_j7c8fa", "t3_j65s10", "t3_j61w6p", "t3_j43yai", "t3_j40bem", "t3_j3eykq", "t3_j2jxyx", "t3_j261xv", "t3_j1vngl", "t3_j0g2nl", "t3_izm9cx", "t3_iyhkny", "t3_ix9ipe", "t3_ix5a4g", "t3_iw29ja", "t3_iverkv", "t3_iu3yxd", "t3_isv81g", "t3_isnn0y", "t3_ic1ppo", "t3_i9fbj8", "t3_i8kcue", "t3_i795h6", "t3_i5o2m4", "t3_i4tqjj", "t3_i3o4mq", "t3_i2ha3h", "t3_i1ch4u", "t3_i0s7jm", "t3_hzfk4m", "t3_hx8xej", "t3_iyz5md", "t3_ljjdbn", "t3_lfo0wa", "t3_lgzmsv"], "description": "", "title": "Darkroom Practice 1", "created_at_utc": 1598295005.319, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "author_name": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "collection_id": "9d40574e-7d58-4a75-8ee9-549600a9e4c0", "author_id": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "last_update_utc": 1620558726.961, "display_layout": null}], "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 140, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"p8pq6z5oavw51": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 108, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p8pq6z5oavw51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f544bb90c3c1a58ab6aa537cbc0feab58a5e6e72"}, {"y": 216, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p8pq6z5oavw51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a47dda795dce6ac0794dad1665fcb8fcc3b0c5ee"}, {"y": 320, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p8pq6z5oavw51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f02da67b31179bfc48775a6299ff68d83eb45e02"}, {"y": 640, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p8pq6z5oavw51.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ffa5ed607f2d5ed6ebadaf483827fb7b3dd1d63"}, {"y": 960, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p8pq6z5oavw51.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e15c1c7856124ea9c01500103bacb7e4531ece51"}, {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p8pq6z5oavw51.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df541a5c40dcc6e5259eb8066a4374f45d9419e5"}], "s": {"y": 1080, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/p8pq6z5oavw51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bdc2f870f50a941c74b73e9852f1132947ab85d"}, "id": "p8pq6z5oavw51"}}, "name": "t3_jmsrw3", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "domain": "self.castaneda", "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Darkroom Practice", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/hr4wpjMqpwPKeGGQj9DZDBguoHzoZBWPhbj3KeFP5Lw.jpg", "edited": 1604345840.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1604340631.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/p8pq6z5oavw51.jpg?width=1080&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8bdc2f870f50a941c74b73e9852f1132947ab85d\"&gt;A strong gaze can tunnel into anything.

Thank you. Remember, that Tensegrity was discovered, according to Carlos, when bodies of practitioners moved on their own in dreaming and heightened awareness states, and later on they have tried to copy those moves and assemble them into groups and forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This could be a similar one, where dancer is being moved by energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have an intuition that the deeper we go in practice and learn to perceive energy of the physical body, as well as the energy of luminous one, we could grasp energy fluctuations unique and fit for us. Thus discovering our own, individual passes.

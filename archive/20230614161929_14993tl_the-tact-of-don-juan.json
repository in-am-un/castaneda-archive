The average man's connecting link with intent is practically dead, and sorcerers begin with a link that is useless because it does not respond voluntarily.\n\nHe stressed that in order to revive that link sorcerers needed a rigorous, fierce purpose- a special state of mind called unbending intent. Accepting that **the nagual** was the only being capable of supplying unbending intent was the most difficult part of the sorcerer's apprenticeship. I argued that I could not see the difficulty.\n\n\"An apprentice is someone who is striving to clear and revive his connecting link with the spirit,\" he explained. \"Once the link is revived, he is no longer an apprentice; but until that time, in order to keep going he needs a fierce purpose, which of course he doesn't have. So he allows the nagual to provide the purpose, and to do that he has to relinquish his individuality. That's the difficult part.\"\n\nHe reminded me of something he had told me often: that volunteers were not welcome in the sorcerers' world because they already had a purpose of their own- which made it particularly hard for them to relinquish their individuality. If the sorcerers' world demanded ideas and actions contrary to the volunteers' purpose, the volunteers simply refused to change.\n\n\"Reviving an apprentice's link is a nagual's most challenging and intriguing work,\" don Juan continued, \"and one of his biggest headaches too. Depending, of course, on the apprentice's personality, the designs of the spirit are either sublimely simple or the most complex labyrinths.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nExcept now,  we have no Naguals.

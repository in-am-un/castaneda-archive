But be sure to send a percentage back to the guru.\n\nI'm afraid to say, this fate has almost befallen Cleargreen.\n\nSo to fight it, let me remind you, we can't change ourselves.  We'll always be \"inferior\", not \"superior\".\n\nWe'll simply be able to do magic, despite being an asshole.\n\nAn inspirational quote.  I seem to recall Carlos talking about this quite a few times in class. It was \"old fart\", \"piss\", and \"puke\". Those are the 3 types.\n\nWhen he mentioned \"piss\", everyone turned to look at a woman in class whom I will not name.\n\nBut it was clear, she was a piss.\n\nThe fart types were so abundant, there wasn't any direction to look that didn't have one.\n\nThe pukes are the ones responsible for hatred of inorganic beings, I suspect.  But a fart might get it into his head to insist they are evil. For some other purpose, such as a pending book deal.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"By the time we come to sorcery, our personality is already formed,\" he said, and shrugged his shoulders to signify resignation, \"and all we can do is practice controlled folly and laugh at ourselves.\"\n\nI had a surge of empathy and assured him that to me he was not in any way petty or devious.\n\n\"But that's my basic personality,\" he insisted.\n\nAnd I insisted that it was not.\n\n\"Stalkers who practice controlled folly believe that, in matters of personality, the entire human race falls into three categories,\" he said, and smiled the way he always did when he was setting me up.\n\n\"That's absurd,\" I protested. \"Human behavior is too complex to be categorized so simply.\"\n\n\"Stalkers say that we are not so complex as we think we are,\" he said, \"and that we all belong to one of three categories.\"\n\nI laughed out of nervousness. Ordinarily I would have taken such a statement as a joke, but this time, because my mind was extremely clear and my thoughts were poignant, I felt he was indeed serious.\n\n\"Are you serious?\" I asked, as politely as I could.\n\n\"Completely serious,\" he replied, and began to laugh.\n\nHis laughter relaxed me a little. And he continued explaining the stalkers' system of classification. He said that people in the first class are the perfect secretaries, assistants, companions. They have a very fluid personality, but their fluidity is not nourishing. They are, however, serviceable, concerned, totally domestic, resourceful within limits, humorous, wellmannered, sweet, delicate. In other words, they are the nicest people one could find, but they have one huge flaw: they can't function alone. They are always in need of someone to direct them.\n\nWith direction, no matter how strained or antagonistic that direction might be, they are stupendous. By themselves, they perish.\n\nPeople in the second class are not nice at all. They are petty, vindictive, envious, jealous, selfcentered. They talk exclusively about themselves and usually demand that people conform to their standards. They always take the initiative even though they are not comfortable with it. They are thoroughly ill at ease in every situation and never relax. They are insecure and are never pleased; the more insecure they become the nastier they are. Their fatal flaw is that they would kill to be leaders.\n\nIn the third category are people who are neither nice nor nasty. They serve no one, nor do they impose themselves on anyone. Rather they are indifferent. They have an exalted idea about themselves derived solely from daydreams and wishful thinking. If they are extraordinary at anything, it is at waiting for things to happen. They are waiting to be discovered and conquered and have a marvelous facility for creating the illusion that they have great things in abeyance, which they always promise to deliver but never do because, in fact, they do not have such resources.\n\nDon Juan said that he himself definitely belonged to the second class. He then asked me to classify myself and I became rattled. Don Juan was practically on the ground, bent over with laughter.\n\nHe urged me again to classify myself, and reluctantly I suggested I might be a combination of the three.\n\n\"Don't give me that combination nonsense,\" he said, still laughing. \"We are simple beings, each of us is one of the three types. And as far as I am concerned, you belong to the second class. Stalkers call them farts.\"\n\nI began to protest that his scheme of classification was demeaning. But I stopped myself just as I was about to go into a long tirade. Instead I commented that if it were true that there are only three types of personalities, all of us are trapped in one of those three categories for life with no hope of change or redemption.\n\nHe agreed that that was exactly the case. Except that one avenue for redemption remained.\n\nSorcerers had long ago learned that only our personal self-reflection fell into one of the categories.\n\n\"The trouble with us is that we take ourselves seriously,\" he said. \"Whichever category our self-image falls into only matters because of our self-importance. If we weren't self-important, it wouldn't matter at all which category we fell into.\n\n\"I'll always be a fart,\" he continued, his body shaking with laughter. \"And so will you. But now I am a fart who doesn't take himself seriously, while you still do.\"\n\nI was indignant. I wanted to argue with him, but could not muster the energy for it.\n\nIn the empty plaza, the reverberation of his laughter was eerie.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "The Three Personality Types", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "General Knowledge"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_hrqh8l", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 14, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General Knowledge", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 14, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": 1594829860.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1594829617.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very common to come to Sorcery having been elsewhere.

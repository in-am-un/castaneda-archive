Possibly closest is Zen enlightenment, because the rest of Buddhism and Hinduism has a \"continuum\", where you relearn the world based on the first level  of \"Emptiness\", or \"Cosmic Consciousness\".  So you go deeper and deeper, and they decided those are \"new\" levels of enlightenment.  One such system has 5 I know of.\n\nBut before you get confused, enlightenment is not permanent. The Asians made that up, because of how the Asian social order works.  It's a \"Seniority System\".  So it would be unseemly if an enlightened master was suddenly not enlightened anymore, which certainly will happen if you don't keep moving yourself back there on a regular basis.  \n\nI've seen it happen to famous Japanese Zen masters, but you have to be friends with the monks, and well trusted, to hear them admit it.\n\nThe same is true in sorcery.  You can lose it if you don't keep working. And it never gets any easier.  You have to work like a dog to get to the rewards, and then once you have them the natural thing is to think you can relax.  But then you learn, you still have to work like a dog if you want to make progress.  If you only work like  a cat, you remain still. If you stop for a while, you revert back.\n\nIt's because we're using something the Buddhists, Taoists, and Hindus don't know about.\n\nThe assemblage point.  They never thought of it, so they're very confused about what's going on.  Not to mention, those all turned into businesses with franchises, so for the most part there's nothing there worth pursuing.  At least, not if you have sorcery available.  \n\nAnd sorcery is much older.  Carlos stated possibly 10K years.  And that the origin was the Olmecs.  That produced some giggles from people who can go to Wikipedia, and have a grudge against Carlos.  10,000 years?  The Olmecs only go back to 1500BC, with pre-olmecs going back to 2500BC.\n\nBut in fact, there were Indian artifacts in my area as far back as 12,000 years ago.   \n\nAnd the Olmec people recognized on Wikipedia came from other older peoples, in the Americas.  So the 10K estimate makes sense.\n\nLikely they first used power plants, which let them perceive inorganic beings.  And the inorganic beings themselves taught them sorcery. \n\nThey love to do that!   I suppose it's like a high school badminton coach, who actually just likes to see the girls in those little badminton skirts they wear. So he's happy to manage the team.\n\nIOBs are happy to manage your team too.\n\nNo, heightened awareness is not the buzzing before an OBE. But that is a sign you moved the assemblage point.\n\nI'm going out on a limb here, making up numbers Carlos would have cringed to hear.\n\nBut we don't have Carlos or the witches to give us the real number, so it's not a big crime.\n\nI'd say, you moved it around 4 inches down the back, to produce your buzzing and OBE.\n\nThat's about how far it moves during ordinary dreams.  Here's the J curve, in case you don't know about it.  Heightened awareness is way down the back, up the front again, and right next to your belly button on the right.  Once you move it below the bottom, you'll be in \"Fairy Land\", meaning, visible magic all around you.  As you can see from the pictures, showing what happens at each position.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f](https://preview.redd.it/e5d6gzqi3i551.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6f226ac0f4340ee743c2526be6edd2d9f25e51f)\n\nThe buzzing in the ears happens around 1.5 hours before you move it that far!  And it's only that fast if you have a good technique to move it with.  The darkroom gazing will move it to heightened awareness in around 2 hours, once you can get a decent level of silence.\n\nOf course, if you have a Nagual, he can slap you on the back and move it there instantly.  But we only have a technique now.  A technique designed by a helpful inorganic being called, \"Fairy\".  She was given to private classes by Carlos, but didn't find many people who wanted her to visit.\n\nThat's where \"puffery\" comes in. As Carlos was dying, he realized his plan to \"clean us off\" wasn't suitable anymore. He'd been taking it slowly, because random people freak out when real sorcery becomes visible. \n\nSo he had us concentrate on Tensegrity and Recapitulation.  Both \"fix\" your personality.\n\nHe had a workshop audience in the thousands!  So he needed to hose people off a bit, to avoid disaster.\n\nAnd mainly, so poor Carlos didn't have to suffer as much.  Trust me, he suffered endlessly with his private class and inner circle!  I've gotten to see the same thing, trying to help in here.\n\nIn fact, his many students killed him in the end.\n\nHis idea to slow things down and take it save, also created an emergency. He never got around to releasing visible magic to us.  \n\nOnce it was clear he was going to die soon, he started to release it. But it was ignored by Cleargreen, the organization he set up to teach.\n\nThere are pictures in here, of what he released.  Pandora's Box tensegrity move, and Zuleica's pass, illustrate what he wanted us to do.  Make the Tensegrity visible.\n\nAnything showing \"the wall\" in the illustrations, is what he gave us for a new teacher.  Intent itself.  I believe it's in that J curve diagram I gave you. But it's also in Juan's last post, on that heart shaped rock.\n\nAnd then there's a whole system of magic, hidden in the Tensegrity movements.\n\nIf you can see purple light in the darkness, you're in business! That's what Tensegrity was designed for.\n\nTo push around those purple puffs.\n\nNow the question is, can you come up with 3 hours a day?\n\nIf not, at least 1 hour will make you realize, you need 3.\n\nLess, and you'd better be super talented.  Have yet to see one of those, who didn't do that to themselves with too many power plants.  Which makes it far less than fully useful.\n\nIf you only have 30 minutes, go find my \"Simple Silence Technique\", and kiss visible magic goodbye for now.  But you can learn a lot of things with that technique. IOBs, remote viewing, entering lucid dreaming directly from awake.  It's just not enough to fully convince you, sorcery is real.\n\nSo, you also have some terms like \"OBE\".\n\nTry to drop them all.  Third eye, OBE,  Chakras, Kundalini.  Not useful for learning sorcery.\n\nThey are in fact a hindrance.  \n\nAlso dump anything you read from a book other than those of Carlos or the witches. Those are all frauds, and can actually prevent you from learning just because they put wrong ideas in your head.\n\nWhen you glance at pure whitish energy on the walls of your dark room, waiting for it to assemble another world, and you end up in in Africa, you might remember you were watching that documentary on Africa 2 days ago.  And it seems to have influenced the results.\n\n\"OBE\" will do the same, in a very bad way.  \n\nThe situation is this:  If there is a fixed reality, it isn't very useful.  We're stationary bubbles of awareness on a sea of brilliant fibers of  yellow light, stretching into infinity.\n\nIt's everything possible for us.  But we only use a tiny bit of it, to create our reality.\n\nEstimate of how much?  Can't.  We use a ball around 3 feet in diameter, while our luminous shell is perhaps 12 feet in diameter.  But within that 3 feet, we don't use all of it.\n\nAnd a TINY shift of the assemblage point inside our luminous shell, completely alters reality.\n\nSo I'll guess:  We use 1/10,000 of our available range of emanations.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ncontinued...", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gi7600e", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heightened awareness is &amp;quot;Enlightenment&amp;#39;.

But it&amp;#39;s also in Juan&amp;#39;s last post, on that heart shaped rock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s a whole system of magic, hidden in the Tensegrity movements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can see purple light in the darkness, you&amp;#39;re in business! That&amp;#39;s what Tensegrity was designed for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To push around those purple puffs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the question is, can you come up with 3 hours a day?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not, at least 1 hour will make you realize, you need 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Less, and you&amp;#39;d better be super talented.  Have yet to see one of those, who didn&amp;#39;t do that to themselves with too many power plants.  Which makes it far less than fully useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you only have 30 minutes, go find my &amp;quot;Simple Silence Technique&amp;quot;, and kiss visible magic goodbye for now.  But you can learn a lot of things with that technique. IOBs, remote viewing, entering lucid dreaming directly from awake.  It&amp;#39;s just not enough to fully convince you, sorcery is real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, you also have some terms like &amp;quot;OBE&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try to drop them all.  Third eye, OBE,  Chakras, Kundalini.  Not useful for learning sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are in fact a hindrance.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also dump anything you read from a book other than those of Carlos or the witches. Those are all frauds, and can actually prevent you from learning just because they put wrong ideas in your head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you glance at pure whitish energy on the walls of your dark room, waiting for it to assemble another world, and you end up in in Africa, you might remember you were watching that documentary on Africa 2 days ago.  And it seems to have influenced the results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OBE&amp;quot; will do the same, in a very bad way.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The situation is this:  If there is a fixed reality, it isn&amp;#39;t very useful.  We&amp;#39;re stationary bubbles of awareness on a sea of brilliant fibers of  yellow light, stretching into infinity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s everything possible for us.  But we only use a tiny bit of it, to create our reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Estimate of how much?  Can&amp;#39;t.  We use a ball around 3 feet in diameter, while our luminous shell is perhaps 12 feet in diameter.  But within that 3 feet, we don&amp;#39;t use all of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And a TINY shift of the assemblage point inside our luminous shell, completely alters reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ll guess:  We use 1/10,000 of our available range of emanations.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;continued...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/kqwdrw/hi_im_new_i_dont_know_how_to_reddit/gi7600e/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1609867595.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_kqwdrw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 16}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gi8ayw7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TechnoMagical_Intent", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gi83vpz", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mo1k5m8", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "I've got the clip in my archive but if I upload it to any of the Reddit approved sites it will get DMCA karate-chopped.\n\nEdit: [Phenomenon -

If no one else has been there, that resulting world is chaotic and keeps changing.\n\nIf two people have been there, you can manage to hold it, sort of like 2 people venturing into some weird psychic realm. It's real enough where you are standing, but don't look too far out. \n\nCholita and I have a reality like that in our home. It's just a dreaming realm, created by an inorganic being accident.  The parts we've visited a bunch are relatively stable, but if you venture off too far, it gets chaotic and keeps mutating.  1/4th mile into it, it connects to an inorganic beings world.\n\nSo, \"reality\" needs people to perceive it, before it becomes as real as this one we live in.\n\nWith billions viewing the same emanations, they are so reliable that we can deduce the \"laws of physics\" for the world we've selected.\n\nBut in fact, those no longer apply if you move the assemblage point far.\n\nYou'll get to experience that yourself, if you work at it.\n\nSo the point of this is, you need other people to have been somewhere, if you want it to be reliable.\n\nThe ancient Olmecs pushed far, and brought their friends with them, and carved a path deep into reality.\n\nThat's the only path we have.  So you have to be true to it.  Don't mix in other paths, or other systems.  The path of intent of the Olmecs is like old railroad tracks in the jungle, leading off to somewhere far away.\n\nYou can't just hook yourself to any set of railroad tracks. They don't lead to the same place.\n\nSo keep the OBE down.  The path of OBE is attention seeking. Something easy to do, so you can brag it up with your friends, and get attention.\n\nMostly it's exaggerated dreams.  But always, it's infected with \"me, me, me\", the song we sign to ourselves, deep in our soul.\n\nThat's  the current position of the assemblage point all of us are stuck to.  Self-pity.  \"Poor baby me\", as the witches used to say.\n\nWe want to move away from that, to \"Holy shit!  I'm surrounded by magic and there are other worlds all along the walls of my room!\"\n\nFor that path, you need to keep to the \"Intent of the Ancient Sorcerer's of Mexico\".\n\nCarlos was so obsessed with this very specific path that he even changed the names of people in his group, made up stories about them which tied them to the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, and he created \"cover stories\", relating them to characters in his books.\n\nWas the \"blue scout\" really the one from his books?  We'll never know. And it doesn't really matter.  Either way, he was following the intent of sorcery.\n\nHe wasn't being tricky and trying to justify his books. He was trying to give those individuals a \"hook\" to that specific intent.\n\nThat's because intent itself, is alive.\n\nIt gives us gifts when we practice. \n\nThe rule is: \n\nWork hard towards an impossible or crazy goal, but one which seems to improve  yourself. Expand your awareness of the universe.\n\nAfter a fair amount of work, *intent* will give you a gift along that line.  For instance, you work to see purple puffs of light, and then one night all hell breaks loose, and the puffs become as brilliant as the sun.  or more accurately, your assemblage point suddenly drops another 6 inches.\n\nThen the next night, not.  Gone.  You have to earn it back.\n\nIt's a long process. But you certainly don't want intent getting confused about which path you are following.\n\nInstead of the gift of brilliant purple balls  of light, you might get Yogi diapers in the mail.\n\nOr inherit all the collected works of Crowley.\n\nOr even join the Jehovah's witnesses, and make it your mission to go door to door and convert the whole world.\n\nYou don't want that.  You want sorcery.  So even if something else seems similar, put it aside.\n\nWhen new people come here, there are several things which can doom them from the start:\n\nA) They believe there are many paths out there, all equal, and magic is easy to find.  They can't accept that there's only one path for us.  Those come here, but they usually pass through quickly after feeling insulted for being told that is not true.  I suppose it invalidates all the fake work they've done in the past, so it produces a bruise to their ego.  Since sorcery isn't that important to them anyway, they return to the weeble subreddit, where cats see spirits.  (weeble was it?)\n\nB) They are on a big ego trip, already claim to be \"seers\", or advance dreamers, but in fact they haven't ever done any serious work.  They already have what they want!  To run around bullying others, claiming to be bad ass sorcerers.  We get those all the time in here! You'll learn to recognize them in 2 sentences.  I believe there's one skulking around our graveyard right now (A Beetlejuice Movie reference).\n\nC) They have plans to \"reveal\" themselves to the world soon, as the first person to \"get\" Castaneda.  Probably they've added some Chinese sage philosophy which gives them the belief they almost have it \"solved\". But the truth is they're lazy, and looking for an easier job.  They plan to charge a small fee for their excellent teaching materials, which they've never actually tried, and which also consists mainly of their own mental masturbations.\n\nD) They are waiting for the \"lineages\" to reform, so a big daddy like figure can come along, visit them in their dreams to prove it's worth their precious efforts to try, and basically do all the work for them.  Essentially, they want to join the Brady Bunch and be part of a new family. (Another out of date entertainment reference).\n\nE) They are looking for a \"spiritual\" mate. They will tolerate sorcery, if they have to.  But the Yoga guys turned them down already.\n\nF) Someday they'll write a book about all this.\n\nG)  They have been fully absorbed by the \"happily ever after\" myth, which is the basis of nearly all love songs.  It's a lie.  But it has sucked up nearly the entire world.\n\nSuch people remain on the sides, tossing stones to get attention.\n\nYou have to come up with practice time. If the wife won't let you stare at demons in the darkness for hours each night, you have a problem.\n\nWomen, not so much.  You can bewitch that husband.\n\nCholita has me well trained.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_gi76747", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;continued from before...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the assemblage point shifts, you use different fibers (emanations).

For instance, you work to see purple puffs of light, and then one night all hell breaks loose, and the puffs become as brilliant as the sun.  or more accurately, your assemblage point suddenly drops another 6 inches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the next night, not.  Gone.  You have to earn it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a long process. But you certainly don&amp;#39;t want intent getting confused about which path you are following.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of the gift of brilliant purple balls  of light, you might get Yogi diapers in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or inherit all the collected works of Crowley.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or even join the Jehovah&amp;#39;s witnesses, and make it your mission to go door to door and convert the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t want that.  You want sorcery.  So even if something else seems similar, put it aside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When new people come here, there are several things which can doom them from the start:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A) They believe there are many paths out there, all equal, and magic is easy to find.  They can&amp;#39;t accept that there&amp;#39;s only one path for us.  Those come here, but they usually pass through quickly after feeling insulted for being told that is not true.  I suppose it invalidates all the fake work they&amp;#39;ve done in the past, so it produces a bruise to their ego.  Since sorcery isn&amp;#39;t that important to them anyway, they return to the weeble subreddit, where cats see spirits.  (weeble was it?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B) They are on a big ego trip, already claim to be &amp;quot;seers&amp;quot;, or advance dreamers, but in fact they haven&amp;#39;t ever done any serious work.  They already have what they want!  To run around bullying others, claiming to be bad ass sorcerers.  We get those all the time in here! You&amp;#39;ll learn to recognize them in 2 sentences.  I believe there&amp;#39;s one skulking around our graveyard right now (A Beetlejuice Movie reference).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C) They have plans to &amp;quot;reveal&amp;quot; themselves to the world soon, as the first person to &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; Castaneda.  Probably they&amp;#39;ve added some Chinese sage philosophy which gives them the belief they almost have it &amp;quot;solved&amp;quot;. But the truth is they&amp;#39;re lazy, and looking for an easier job.  They plan to charge a small fee for their excellent teaching materials, which they&amp;#39;ve never actually tried, and which also consists mainly of their own mental masturbations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;D) They are waiting for the &amp;quot;lineages&amp;quot; to reform, so a big daddy like figure can come along, visit them in their dreams to prove it&amp;#39;s worth their precious efforts to try, and basically do all the work for them.  Essentially, they want to join the Brady Bunch and be part of a new family. (Another out of date entertainment reference).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E) They are looking for a &amp;quot;spiritual&amp;quot; mate. They will tolerate sorcery, if they have to.  But the Yoga guys turned them down already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;F) Someday they&amp;#39;ll write a book about all this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;G)  They have been fully absorbed by the &amp;quot;happily ever after&amp;quot; myth, which is the basis of nearly all love songs.  It&amp;#39;s a lie.  But it has sucked up nearly the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Such people remain on the sides, tossing stones to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to come up with practice time. If the wife won&amp;#39;t let you stare at demons in the darkness for hours each night, you have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Women, not so much.  You can bewitch that husband.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cholita has me well trained.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/kqwdrw/hi_im_new_i_dont_know_how_to_reddit/gi76747/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1609867684.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_kqwdrw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sblm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "castaneda", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gi6jvvx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "HasenPffefer", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1609856829.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_kqwdrw", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_3ddw4gzc", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "You guys really have a wonderful group here, thanks for that.

Like in your 20s?  I'm hoping this is the case, because that would explain a lot of what's coming through between the lines.  \n\nSo what's coming through? \n\nWell first, fear.  Your post is dripping with fear, and that has been pointed out to you already.  You also probably know that fear is the first enemy. I'll try to give you some examples of my own fear, and how it hindered me at first: I'm a crazy dreamer, and in my 20s it was literally every night, a mix of lucid dreams, that often lead to reaching the energy body.  If you know about this, you know about sleep paralysis, IOBS, etc., etc.  Imagine the fear I had - the same fear you have of the flyers - and imagine how I felt back then, not being able to talk to anyone about it.  All I ever found was this old website called \"Sustained Action\" and believe it or not there were posts on there from a much younger Dan giving insanely awesome dreaming advice.  So for me, that helped - knowing that I wasn't alone.  You aren't either.  I've experienced the flyers at times.  This subreddit is a gold mine, and safe haven for you.\n\nWhich leads me to... don't abuse it.  Because my second conclusion, and one that everyone here can see, is that you are super excited... almost hyper, or manic.  This can lead to what we call mental masturbation, where you are so scared, and so excited at the same time, that you come post every experience you have, and then engage in long-winded comment battles with everyone who calls you out on 'wasting time'.  So please, don't bite the hand that feeds, and don't ruin a good thing.  Can you imagine people stopping by this subreddit to learn more about Carlos and coming across this post?  It reeks of manic storytelling, fear, superstition, and frankly a lack of understanding.  It doesn't have the proper intent of the sub, and I'm surprised honestly they have left it up.  Maybe techno is getting soft? ; )  But I'll tell you what... if it stays up, I think one day, probably about 1 year from now, you're going to look back on this post and blush to yourself with embarrassment.  And that would be a good thing.  It would mean you've conquered your ego, and hopefully your fear as well. \n\nYou want fear?  There were times when I first started reaching the energy body, where I felt some pushing hard right up near my perineum.  It literally felt like being given a proctology exam, or being fucked.  I'm not joking.  This would happen and I'd start freaking the fuck out.  When I first came to this sub, I posted about it and nobody knew what I was talking about.  It still happens sometimes when I reach the energy body.  Can you imagine how alone that felt back then?  In my 20s?  Getting 'energy ass-raped in the second attention'?  Who exactly do I go to to discuss something like that?  My internist?  \"Hey doc, all is going great, except sometimes when I'm practicing dreaming, I'm pretty sure a deceased Carlos Castaneda, or maybe Don Juan, is trying fuck me in the ass.\"  I stopped practicing for almost a year after that.  (As a sidenote, ever since learning about the J Curve here, I've wondered if it was just the AP going down and back up the front of me, and somehow I interpreted it as being attacked down there.  I don't know, just a theory.\" \n\nSo... I'm trying to extend to you a little courtesy and empathy, because I've experienced these intensely scare episodes myself, and I also had the experience of the books lining up perfectly with everything I ever believed before I found them - it was like finding them was finding the owner's manual to my own mind.  I had always played with intent, and had a very clean link to it, and also knew when I had dirtied that link, before I even knew those terms.  Finding Nagualism was like coming home.\n\nSo try to remember you're not alone - and the double-edge meaning there.  It means you don't have to be as fearful as you seem, because others have had similar experiences.  And it also means you're not as special and unique as you might think, for the very same reasons:  others have had similar experiences as you, which I've outlined above.

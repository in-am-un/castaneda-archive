You have done a lot of research, but none of what you have read is going to help you here.\n\nFirst you are full of many worries about losing material things, or your \"sanity\", and especially it sounds like you are scared of losing your ego. You sound well-educated in matters of the Tonal, but you have no clue what you are reading here because you lack the foundation that reading all of the books would give you.\n\nYou talk about language being the basis of reality. Yes. Language, especially the Internal Dialogue assembles our \"common reality\" that people today operate inside. The Silence we seek removes the illusion and returns us to the actual state we were born before being programmed by society, our peers and our parents to ignore the true reality that is all around us. This is such a basic concept that it is obvious that you have not read any of the books. \n\nYou also sound young, and there is a lot more work to be done besides just going into a darkroom and seeing magic. I am a stalker so I'm going to be real honest. You are trapped by your ego. I do not believe you would have been able to Silence your Internal Dialogue with all of the clutter going on in your mind, so please stop pretending. This is not the place for that. Nothing you parrot back at us as your darkroom achievements could possibly be true. You are just not that ready, and despite what Dan says, as a woman I can tell you, you are just not that \"talented.\"\n\nYou are scared about losing your mind, but if you understood yourself better through Recapitulation, you would not have that fear. We want to lose all of the things your cling on so tightly to because it is all river of shit to us. If insanity is the price, so what? I have been in 10 different mental hospitals because my family and my doctor wanted me to shut up and conform to their lame reality. Yes it is good to have money and be successful because it buys you time. I am lucky that I am in a situation of my own making where I have my own agency over my time to spend three plus hours a night practicing and I FAIL many nights to shut off my damn Intenal Dialogue and achieve anything close to silence. I begin to see and i hear my Internal Dialogue sputter and then finally slow down and sometimes even turn completely unintellible but i have not seen the grid yet because it is almost effing impossible. But the few good things I learn every night keeps me at it every night I can (about 6 a week for almost the last month). I CONSIDER MYSELF A BABY. A BEGINNER!!!\n\nI am really getting sick of listening to all of the mental masturbation that goes on from people like you who come into this subreddit and try on a persona here like a new piece of clothing looking to all of us to tell you if you look \"pretty enough.\"\n\n But I have never worried about \"going insane.\" I read the first books at age 15 and bought the new ones as they came out. I re-read them twice. I have intuitively KNOWN that the reality described in the books is real and when i found this subreddit i was crying with gratitude to have guidance because all of the pretenders out there had me convinced that I had not been \"selected\" for sorcery, and I accepted it at the time.  I spent two years preparing to just be able to go into the darkroom by getting off the unnecessary psych meds and my doctor never applauded calling me a case study. Nor would I care.  I didn't ask a question here until I thought I had something relevant to ask.\n\nYou have come into this subreddit and been attracted by the pictures, and the stories and think. \"I'm smart, I'm special, I would be perfect to get this magic and I will share all of my river of shit knowledge and enlighten and dazzle everyone on this site and be looked upon as a master without putting in any work.\" You offer to teach us many times in your post. You need to start you studies by reading in the About Section the post about Bad Players.\n\nI can prove this to you by your misreading of the story of the alien newspaper. You glossed over the story and only looked for the reflections of your own thoughts. The reason that Carlos and Carol left the newspaper behind had nothing to do with the alien language trapping them with its language and causing them to reassemble their reality in the alien world.

You have done a lot of research, but none of what you have read is going to help you here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First you are full of many worries about losing material things, or your &amp;quot;sanity&amp;quot;, and especially it sounds like you are scared of losing your ego. You sound well-educated in matters of the Tonal, but you have no clue what you are reading here because you lack the foundation that reading all of the books would give you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You talk about language being the basis of reality. Yes. Language, especially the Internal Dialogue assembles our &amp;quot;common reality&amp;quot; that people today operate inside. The Silence we seek removes the illusion and returns us to the actual state we were born before being programmed by society, our peers and our parents to ignore the true reality that is all around us. This is such a basic concept that it is obvious that you have not read any of the books. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also sound young, and there is a lot more work to be done besides just going into a darkroom and seeing magic. I am a stalker so I&amp;#39;m going to be real honest. You are trapped by your ego. I do not believe you would have been able to Silence your Internal Dialogue with all of the clutter going on in your mind, so please stop pretending. This is not the place for that. Nothing you parrot back at us as your darkroom achievements could possibly be true. You are just not that ready, and despite what Dan says, as a woman I can tell you, you are just not that &amp;quot;talented.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are scared about losing your mind, but if you understood yourself better through Recapitulation, you would not have that fear. We want to lose all of the things your cling on so tightly to because it is all river of shit to us. If insanity is the price, so what? I have been in 10 different mental hospitals because my family and my doctor wanted me to shut up and conform to their lame reality. Yes it is good to have money and be successful because it buys you time. I am lucky that I am in a situation of my own making where I have my own agency over my time to spend three plus hours a night practicing and I FAIL many nights to shut off my damn Intenal Dialogue and achieve anything close to silence. I begin to see and i hear my Internal Dialogue sputter and then finally slow down and sometimes even turn completely unintellible but i have not seen the grid yet because it is almost effing impossible. But the few good things I learn every night keeps me at it every night I can (about 6 a week for almost the last month). I CONSIDER MYSELF A BABY. A BEGINNER!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am really getting sick of listening to all of the mental masturbation that goes on from people like you who come into this subreddit and try on a persona here like a new piece of clothing looking to all of us to tell you if you look &amp;quot;pretty enough.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I have never worried about &amp;quot;going insane.&amp;quot; I read the first books at age 15 and bought the new ones as they came out. I re-read them twice. I have intuitively KNOWN that the reality described in the books is real and when i found this subreddit i was crying with gratitude to have guidance because all of the pretenders out there had me convinced that I had not been &amp;quot;selected&amp;quot; for sorcery, and I accepted it at the time.  I spent two years preparing to just be able to go into the darkroom by getting off the unnecessary psych meds and my doctor never applauded calling me a case study. Nor would I care.  I didn&amp;#39;t ask a question here until I thought I had something relevant to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have come into this subreddit and been attracted by the pictures, and the stories and think. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m smart, I&amp;#39;m special, I would be perfect to get this magic and I will share all of my river of shit knowledge and enlighten and dazzle everyone on this site and be looked upon as a master without putting in any work.&amp;quot; You offer to teach us many times in your post. You need to start you studies by reading in the About Section the post about Bad Players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can prove this to you by your misreading of the story of the alien newspaper. You glossed over the story and only looked for the reflections of your own thoughts. The reason that Carlos and Carol left the newspaper behind had nothing to do with the alien language trapping them with its language and causing them to reassemble their reality in the alien world. That is your idea, not the truth. Until you understand just this one story, you are not ready. And because of all these things, you will fail at sorcery. You are NOT READY.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you insist on lurking around because you are smart enough to know there is truth here, may I suggest you don&amp;#39;t post anything more until you have:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read all 12 books plus the unpublished two by Carlos and the one by Taisha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn the long form of Unbending intent of tensegrity... all ten plus minutes.

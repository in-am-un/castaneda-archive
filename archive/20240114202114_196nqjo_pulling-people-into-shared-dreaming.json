And these days, they&amp;#39;d be &amp;quot;canceled&amp;quot; for having the stereotype Taco Tia man as their mascot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You only find those by driving by one.  By accident, or because you got lost in the middle of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then next time you crave their rolled tacos, you have to be able to remember how you got there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#39;t look around at the time, you&amp;#39;re doomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until you get lost again years later and find it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My post today showed how you can be doing Tensegrity and get &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; looking at all the amazing sights, surrounding you in the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is what Silent Knowledge brings. It multiples the cool stuff you can see by 1000% minimum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as you look around, you realize it is in fact &amp;quot;layered&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as you watch, the layers interact with each other and you start to extract very odd &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; about how to navigate in it, or use it for practical magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comes with an explanation too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just don&amp;#39;t interrupt the talking guy who is explaining it to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/castaneda/comments/196nqjo/pulling_people_into_shared_dreaming/ki0st8h/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1705352426.0, "media_metadata": {"hmguigkr3occ1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 131, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hmguigkr3occ1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83caccc9c60258e7b8f3bd33b8ab7e4eddbab7d9"}, {"y": 262, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hmguigkr3occ1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56d94222530f4475e3612b5432f0094adf63d2ff"}, {"y": 389, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hmguigkr3occ1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dd57f4192c9502a993835fcea0756b3b296a435"}], "s": {"y": 400, "x": 329, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/hmguigkr3occ1.png?width=329&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1ddb5a83b206f91ca4d388cd985b6f318931384"}, "id": "hmguigkr3occ1"}}, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_196nqjo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "before": null}}]

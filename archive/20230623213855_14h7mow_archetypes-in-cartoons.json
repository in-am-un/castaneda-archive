At first they were like wild animals, snarling at anyone who wasn't one of their own. The costumes were even slightly off.\n\nBut over time they mutated into the most beloved villains of that series. Their costumes even became more interesting as we discovered that the Ferengi have the best tailors in the galaxy.\n\nWho give them wholesale prices.\n\nOk...\n\nI suppose, the Ferengi were an anti-Semitic stereotype. I'm not sure how they got away with that.\n\nBut they did. And the show was fun to watch.\n\nI'd like to make sure not to be that far off in early episodes of cartoons I plan to make, to teach exactly what's in the books of Carlos Castaneda and the witches.\n\nBecause people seem too lazy to read these days.\n\nAnd when they do they make up most of their understanding of it, to self flatter.\n\nWhat I'd like to do more specifically, is restore the emphasis Carlos had on what people ought to be doing, if they truly expect to see any magical results.\n\nShow the results! With real people who actually exist to some extent, \"out there\" in the real world.\n\nThat way if viewers ask if this is possible, someone can inform them those people actually exist, and actually have done everything shown in the cartoons. And all the techniques work exactly as described, despite being magic far beyond anything ever written about outside the books of Carlos.\n\nMeanwhile, Cholita's the one who got me interested in archetypes.\n\nShe doesn't quite see them as others do. For her they're more like a predictor of the future.\n\nOf the latent intent, involved with any particular personality type.\n\nIf you can manipulate that through witchcraft, you can control the person.\n\nThe lineages seemed aware of this sort of thing, and created \"stories\" around apprentices to shield them from manipulation.\n\nPablito in a battle to the death with his own mother!!!\n\nExcept, they weren't.\n\nCarlos also created stories for several of the women who made it into the inner circle.\n\nWe all just understood that as \"stalking\", but our community has an extremely poor understanding of that topic.\n\nAll they see is someone getting pranked.\n\nAnd they never seem to remember that stalking is merely the use of your actions in the world, to move the assemblage point and stabilize it at a new position.\n\nDoesn't have to involve pranking anyone!\n\nIt's about \"intent\".\n\nAnd how latent trace awareness in the emanations directs the course your assemblage point takes as it moves.\n\nAnd also which emanations are lit up, and which remain dark.\n\nAt any given level of the assemblage point, such as the shoulder blades, there are 20,000 viable alternate versions of that reality.\n\nCarlos gave us that number, but he hated doing it. It was Amy who forced him to agree to it.\n\nNow here's the part that will be hard to understand.\n\nSelf-pity is our biggest enemy.\n\nYou learn that, if you can move your assemblage point all the way to Silent Knowledge. Daily for a year or two.\n\nAt some point you realize, it's only self-pity that causes it to return back to the same old spot above your left shoulder blade.\n\nSelf-pity is merely a mood. You can drop it.\n\nThe proof is, someone hands you a valium pill when you're depressed.\n\n30 minutes later, completely different mood.\n\nOr you snort a line of cocaine.\n\nOr eat a 25mg \"edible\".\n\nIn each case, total mood change.\n\nBut your horrible problems that make you feel sorry for yourself have not changed at all.\n\nYou simply lost the self-pity part.\n\nSorcerers learn to do that without any \"help\".\n\nOnce again, the flow of awareness into the emanations determines everything about the reality you perceive.\n\nBut some things are \"sticky\" and there are traces of past usage of the emanations, making it far easier for those emanations to light up.\n\nWe recapitulate to reduce that.\n\nAnd you can also create a new \"life story\" for yourself, to accomplish a bit of the same.\n\nWhat all of these have in common, is that they affect the flow of your own awareness into the emanations.\n\nCholita is so insistent about archetypes being useful, I figured I'd like to try to plan the cartoon around players who have predictable approaches to sorcery and stalking.\n\nDisney does the same in cartoons. You have the huge man who blows up stuff, and the nerd with glasses who outwits everyone.\n\nWe have a bunch of fixed characters, it would be nice to give them consistent \"intent\", to explore how various people use and relate to sorcery.\n\nThis isn't finished. I just typed in some initial ideas for each character, so I could see the overall plan of it.\n\nIt needs improving.\n\nMight as well see if \"archetypes\" can shed any light on this.\n\nSomeone else got the same idea, so you see a picture of \"story teller's archetypes\" in the upper left.\n\nAnd someone thought Jung's archetypes could be found in Taro cards.\n\nAnd astrology.\n\nI don't know if I'll be able to consolidate those with the characters, but I'm keeping it in mind as I get closer to making full cartoons.\n\nWhy isn't Carlos there?\n\nHe's a bit off limits in the cartoons. I have new AI enhanced software to capture an even better likeness of Robert Redford, who played \"death\" in a twilight zone episode.\n\nSo even the appearance won't be like Carlos. It will simply be what he requested. Twice!\n\nCarmela, \"the one that got away\" is in there too, as his female assistant. I put her back, because Carlos was so hurt when she was lost.\n\nI suppose the cartoon Carmela will be a bit of a cross between Amy and Kylie.\n\nBut those are not really part of the story.\n\nThe story is about apprentices trying to learn real sorcery, and what they encounter in that process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Archetypes In Cartoons?", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Audiovisual"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/castaneda", "hidden": false, "pwls": 7, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"yllidu52lt7b1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yllidu52lt7b1.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7e3eaea6ecbb7be933c0d9ce5c684a3112e9866"}, {"y": 121, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yllidu52lt7b1.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=967b9845d737908068ef6f87d9cbcc954221fe86"}, {"y": 180, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yllidu52lt7b1.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7ab326eff231eec5e778335b04142132376c5bd"}, {"y": 360, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yllidu52lt7b1.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c160a96ce96811f7c9977fee3e59e6dcf6210d3"}, {"y": 540, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yllidu52lt7b1.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d40d079336e373d7a6160626a1d1701e8601061"}, {"y": 607, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yllidu52lt7b1.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9506579418b4ddea0d827f76253642c27b7315a8"}], "s": {"y": 2160, "x": 3840, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/yllidu52lt7b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c54d8241d0029ee0512e1941f40c99dab86ca1b"}, "id": "yllidu52lt7b1"}}, "name": "t3_14h7mow", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 27, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_yicrx32", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Audiovisual", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 27, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/g5HxflpNB8O_Lq5x_0Lezr4c_n1Muy-q4BbIVhJsYsc.jpg", "edited": 1687550794.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1687549135.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 7, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.castaneda", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yllidu52lt7b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3c54d8241d0029ee0512e1941f40c99dab86ca1b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/yllidu52lt7b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3c54d8241d0029ee0512e1941f40c99dab86ca1b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*** From Facebook ***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Archetypes As Intent Containers&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you ever become a big fan of a streaming media show, then go back and watch the first episode years later and notice the characters were &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; for half a season?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll never forgot how the Ferengi mutated in Deep Space Nine.
